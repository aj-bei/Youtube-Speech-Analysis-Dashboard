the importance of picking a fight you'll never win,2024-03-20T20:10:44Z,12.15,1844792,69609,the problem with New York City when its raining is that I cant ride my skateboard or a bicycle so taxi how you doing Im F Im going to uh 55th between 9th and Music 10th okay thank you sir than byebye I think in uh 24 years 24 years of living in New York City Ive never had a cab driver look at pictures of naked women while giving me a ride before but that is that is not what this video is about Doug Lyman says hes boycotting South by Southwest premiere of his Jake Jill Hall film Roadhouse to protest Amazon MGM bypassing theaters for Prime streaming release okay so what this is about is this big Hollywood director the guy that directed like the born identity and Mr and Mrs Smith and like a dozen other big movies like Tom Cruz movies he made this great movie called Roadhouse with Jake Gyllenhaal and Conor McGregor and apparently like Amazon Prime that paid for the movie is like totally scream over because theyre refusing to put the movie into theaters or something like that facts I signed up to make a theatrical motion picture for MGM Amazon bought MGM Amazon said if I make a great film well see what happens I made a great film okay when I read something like this two things occur to me number one this is why I love YouTube and the second thing I always wonder about is like what actually is going on here what actually happened I dont understand and Id love some answers and the difference here is that this big Hollywood director this guy I happen to know Music him Music sound what is this place Doug this is where we mixed Roadhouse did you get my text you were watching porn in the C no the taxi driver was watching porn while I was driving what happens in here walk me through what this space is so you know this is this is where we mix the audio for a film thats you know destined for the big screen as you can see its its the size of a of a movie theater because the Acoustics of a movie theater are different than say the Acoustics of a living room this is where you you mix a movie thats for TV or streaming cuz it replicate someones living room I see do you always wear a cowboy hat Doug Ive never seen you in a cowboy hat in my entire life yeah I mean it it wasnt lost to me I was in a uh a shop in ASP and and uh Jeff Bezos who I dont know uh came riding in on a horse into the store into the store with a cowboy hat you know Im kind of at war with Amazon and it wasnt sort of lost on me the the sort of scale difference of Jeff Bezos on his huge fraking horse in the middle of the store with his cowboy hat and theres always a man above you like you know as successful as I am in the in the film business like right right you always have to answer to somebody you dont have to answer to anybody no thats why I quit but but but uh I got my start making Independent films where there really wasnt anybody telling me what I couldnt do the the irony when I started doing born identity was that we you know which was a huge budget movie for me compared to coming off films like swingers and my line producer kept telling me all these things we couldnt afford to do and I was like I dont understand on Swingers we just did them we had no money and here we have all this money and he was like you know swingers look like    and we cant afford it and I sort of laughed to myself and I was like you know in swingers we couldnt afford the people that told you what you couldnt do so we just did everything youre a bad man youre a bad man youre a Vegas baby Vegas what were did you have to did you steal shots on born identity we did steal the the the look and feel of born identity this whole shaky camera thing that people thought was like on purpose was more cuz like Matt Damon and I were like running into like Garden or and stealing shots we didnt have permits I need to know what went wrong I think he snapped but he has no memory the born identity did you know this was up here no you didnt know that was there I did not know that was there its pretty sizable billboard Doug its pretty big billboard Music is this where you edit yeah do you edit yourself or do you like are you ever yeah like I know how a um is this still from Roadhouse yeah all right so what is the what is this fight that you picked with with Amazon okay so uh you know we made Roadhouse for the big screen before we start do you have insurance what your coverage good like you have dental oh haha is there a hospital nearby is it like too far about like 25 minutes Id say ah I just slapped you are you all right what shot out with IMAX cameras big stars in it like Conor McGregor hey fellas looks like youre having a smacky and its its a party right theres some movies that like you know you watch alone whatever but theres some movies that are like that are a party like Roadhouse is a party I mean its like its like great music and great bar fights I mean theres obviously a lot more to it but at the heart of it its a party Amazon plans to invest 1 billion a year in movies for theaters and then it turns out Amazon never had any intention of putting it in theaters they they want to put it on their streaming service and sell you know toilet paper and toothbrushes by the way Im not the only filmmaker that Amazon is doing this to theres theres a string of filmmakers who were promised you know a theatrical release and then their films were dumped on on streaming important context here is the reason why Doug and I know each other is what 15 years ago or something when I was making what became my HBO series I showed it to Doug hes one of the first people who saw it and he was like youve got something and its funny cuz all these years later after making an HBO show I was like I dont want to be a part of this industry at all I just want to do YouTube or I dont have to answer to anyone and then I read this story about you and you have to answer to the man and it sounds like hes giving you the the the shaft here they are definitely giving me the shaft um I mean theyre giving the the public the shaft thats the Music thing Doug what why are you going to South by South what happened to your boycott the whole point of this video is cuz youre boycotting your own movie why are you going why did you relent you know its tough to do but sometimes you just have to acknowledge that you lost you took on Amazon you fought for your movie I literally did everything in my power to try to get this movie into theaters and I lost so on to the next and if this is going to be literally the only screening where people can buy tickets and go see the movie I want to be there lets go to Music Texas we go I mean the reason I make moves movies is is to then play it in front of an audience like its so much freaking work to make a movie the payoff is when you get to show it when its all done turn it up turn it whats good I hate    losing I mean I really Im not a good loser and I have very publicly lost here but youre excited now look at look at that look at here look at that bus    Amazon Prime on its Music way how you Music doing weird is what weird this whole thing no cuz you know what like I love these guys I made the movie with no Im trying man Im a dad now Im trying to keep up gra you over reck me incredibly well gave me the confidence that I that I could do Music it yeah H welcome J djo nicest on the market did you make it too strong no it is a bit strong but all good now now lets get lets hit them now Applause yeah tonight our incredible Music director so what whats the takeaway here I think when I first read about this even though I know Doug when I first read about this I was like dude what are you complaining about you have the greatest job in the world you get to direct big Hollywood movies you dont get to complain about it but then as I talk to the guy its like hes right the movie belongs in theaters I got to see in the theater its great in the theater he was right and if he didnt stick up for like his movie that him and everybody else works so hard on nobody would have stuck up for it and even though it probably hurt him cuz I know Amazon was pissed they were there they werent happy with him with him and all the things that he had said I appreciated immensely that he stuck up for his for his picture and then I also appreciated that he had like the sense of humor and the humility to show up and show the support for him and his crew and the actors and everybody that works so hard to make that movie so good its a great movie Im sorry you have to watch it on your iPads instead of getting to see it in a theater like I did but its a great movie also um I couldnt figure out how to work this shot into into my little video but I got to I got to meet Conor Music McGregor,146.8312757201646,toothbrushes,0.0,1.0,h-vWRLGnTGg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-vWRLGnTGg
Sisyphus and the Impossible Dream,2024-02-08T15:04:38Z,11.983333333333333,3460169,272544,youre broke totally broke its embarrassing it hurts but then in that moment you say to Music yourself youre finally brave enough to ask her out she was the love of my life she just didnt know it yet yeah I know who you are Casey but who gave you my number right then and there you think someday Im going to marry this girl beautiful Applause beautiful dad wake up are you awake Casey was in a pretty bad motorcycle accident tonight knif I was like are you okay are you okay are you okay and he said no no and then I looked at him and his leg was snapped winter 2007 I was on a scooter the other guy ran a red light Im a mess tomorrow theyre cutting me open and replacing my femur with the titanium rod they rebuilt the leg out of metal the doctor said Id mostly recover but they made it clear Id never run R again broken here here and then in that moment a thought I would heal and Id run a marathon and Id do it in the impossible time of under 3 hours now a marathon is always 262 miles long and to break 3 hours you have to run faster than a 6 minute and 50c per mile Pace thats Music impossible first attempt casy Richmond Virginia Richmond Marathon the goal was 2 hours and 59 minutes lets go casy now Id never run 26 miles in my life but I was confident I could do it just finished my first marathon uh I failed for context the average worldwide marathon time is 4 hours and 29 minutes and my very specific goal was 259 I had to make some changes starting now Id run every day no more drinking definitely no more smoking and uh I lost 20 lb work work itner I was a totally different person for that second Marathon still failed though guys are home New York City 2009 this was my first time breaking 310 California International this is a super fast course Disney Mickey Mouse you get stuck in this Loop you try fail try fail all right today is February 20th 2011 uh for Lauderdale Florida failure its a muscle and every time you use it it gets a little stronger open it up Joe youre so close try fail try Music fail get knocked down get back up get knocked down again yeah night    yeah in Greek mythology theres this story of a king whos been cursed and his curse was to push a boulder up a hill and just as he got to the top the boulder would roll back to the start his curse was to do this really hard thing and hed get super close to accomplishing it but then hed fall back Im not going to make a good time and have to do the entire thing over again and do this over here we go and over for Applause eternity see 26 miles 3 hours 3 minutes fail fail Applause fail and then you get married and then you have a kid and then another kid and then a new job and youre youre moving and youre moving again then youre 40 youre 40 but you still havent done it to Music Applause Music you Music okay were Music off all right just had to have a quick visit to the medical Music tent feel good now but a minute ago I felt very dizzy this is my nana her Impossible Dream was to Dance Forever she did that she was on her feet dancing until the day she died at age Music Applause 92 she made it happen no one else has anything invested in this no one cares if you do it or dont do it to the world this person suit is just your cute little hobby I was 26 when I set this goal I was young then and I couldnt do it now Im old if I dont do this now its just going to get harder and if I back off if I let reason win then I have to carry the weight of that unrealized goal until the day I die so those are the Music stakes and Im I want to be like Nana go Music Runners came from the past 6 am August 1 todays day one of marathon training 2023 New York City Marathon this year was really different this is Roberto hes my coach now and I followed all of his guidance the stadium seen all the fans I took no shortcuts were cooking 653 of it so I have an Olympic Marathon coach hes running next to me and me alone for 26 Music month this was it ah your boy is fit I was fitter than Ive ever been I was Fast 6 days Roberto and I had Roberto pacing me that is the New York City Marathon finish line its pretty exciting it was 16 months of focused training just for this race Good Luck Good Luck todays going to be the day I was Stronger than Ive ever been casy Casey at Mile 13 I was on Pace Casey mile 18 I was on Pace I felt strong go Casey go Music why was this so hard talking about a margin of less than 2 minutes moreover why do I care anymore its not about a broken leg or needing to prove that doctor wrong I have now run two dozen Music marathons I I woner come on Chris youre looking great at age 42 I had just run the fastest marathon of my entire Applause life we had a good day the official is 30127 we had a good time um good day yeah 648 through 22 miles uh so yeah and uh but you were all great out there thanks for cheering its just an arbitrary number I dont need to break 3 hours to know who I am what matters are the experiences the journey even if I failed in the goal see Lifes a battle and there are times when you need to accept that youve been beat its been a long road and theres a lot to be proud of but Im never going to break three Im just not that guy oh    that its been uh 5 weeks since I failed in New York City Im here in Tucson Arizona doing it again you dont just give up you cant just walk away you get out there and you find that    dog yes its hard it was easy everyone would do it youre not out here because its easy you do a lot of meaningless purposeless stupid things you get obsessed you spend years focused on them and literally no one cares but you but you persevere anyway you keep Music running go lets get it you keep running you dont quit you die trying because when when you add up all those stupid meaningless obsessions and accomplishments what they equal what they add up to is your life yeah coming over from New York about the Finish nice Roberto was the Music time again say it again 257 oh my God lets go yeah you    youre sub three Marathon Music

the thing no one will say about Apple Vision Pro,2024-02-03T18:08:18Z,10.616666666666667,7674841,278442,like what thats wild like real yeah I mean your eyes are close your there too much teeth I think I dont know um I want to make a review come help me all right sounds good all right meet you downstairs all right if you want like a normal review of this thing I cant recommend enough to go watch to go watch Marquez brownley his is fantastic this is a different like I kind of have a different take on this and different questions and thats what this is but Marquez is really good what is this thing that Im holding literally you how do you find it Ive had it for like an hour yeah okay can you put Windows up now if you want yeah so like I can put a window up now but when I start walking they like go away they fade away cool enjoy take care all right Music too you get a random pile of bricks an old toilet I found the restroom and a bunch of random wooden poles theres more poles hi lets pile on that boat and leave and as you can see but later in this video were going to aund and also super Island but furnace were going to head over to strategy for interacting with people they Gaslight you into thinking so if youre moving a lot while youre moving this thing comes up that says tracking fail so it doesnt track if youre moving a lot says nothing for the sensors to like lock on to it doesnt know where to put stuff but standing at a subway stop watching a Mr be video is a pretty special its a pretty special experience hold on Jordan let me try to figure out how do I what do you think its interesting I I cant imagine I cant imagine why youre looking at uh Im looking at you right now oh okay I can see you clear as day you got on a blue tie with a beautiful tie pin at the top so I can see you I get off here enjoy your adventure bye bye uh I opened up Apple TV and it was like this window right here de Jordan and as he started to move the window went away with the back with the subway car you cant use Windows if youre in like a if theres a lot of like kinetic movement it I imagine it works in an airplane cuz the airplane is so steady but this is a Subway and its bouncing so I got to wait till we get Music there I thisen tether to my iPhone it seems to be working well enough but for some reason when I try to open Safari it wont Music open I was just responding to text Music messages no way youre the only person I wanted to be in case wait is it case I cant tell did you not tell no way like oh my God no way Im actually freak the idea that I could have my whole like computer digital online world that exists in the real world thats what thats what feels like is bigger than AR or VR like I have the Oculus its great but it definitely feels like a toy this feels like a little glimpse into the future of what Computing could be like down the road why is everybody staring at me do I look as ridiculous as those people make me feel like I look no youre just your eyes are glowing how you doing Jord youre standing right in front of my Mr Beast video come right there okay years ago this used to be a bar yep yeah you want to walk under this so the idea of spatial Computing it doesnt make sense to me when Im sitting in my office Ive got multiple streams but right now Im like in the city Im in the middle of Time Square Ive got my virtual keyboard here Ive got Apple TV there I got YouTube safaris open in here and it all kind of works like this what Ive got going on right now this is wild its impossible for me to imagine that you cant see what I can see everything seems so real and then I can just stand up what up man Music guys are done it thank you next guest Music next Music the butterfly is eating my donut the concept for this video was to run around New York City wearing these cuz I thought that would be funny I think it was funny but something happened something happened today that was completely unexpected and thats something I dont think anyone else has really touched on none of the reviews Ive seen or read none of them really put to words what I experienced so when you take these off they kind of go to sleep like your phone and when you put them back on you have to unlock them they scan your eyeballs and then to start screen recording go through the it takes a second so rather than doing that I just left these on the entire day um the like 2 and 1 2 hour battery pack you can plug into a fatter batteries so I never ran out of battery power and after a couple of hours of running around the streets of New York as did not in a controlled environment my brain sort of clicked and it just forgot that I was looking through cameras and screens and it just it it took what it saw as reality and that is where this this thats where the that profound moment came from and what occurred to me as I was sitting there in Time Square on a bench strangers all around me the real world moving all around me but I had like a big screen up where I was watching a Mr Beast video and then over here I had this keyboard that I could interact with and over here I had my iMessages and over here I had my Apple TV and then all my apps and theyre floating in Time Square in the middle of New York City theyre floating there and Im actually there and theres actual humans around me and in that moment I was like holy this is it this is the future of computing that everyones been promising for like the last 15 years this is something that like let me like truly Peak into where were where all of this is going this isnt the like the future of AR or VR this is the I think this is the future interface for all Computing I think when they figure out how to make these na be these heavy 4 000 metal ski goggles but you know maybe they look like these glasses or something even smaller that that is what itll be in the morning you wont remember your phone you put it on and then thats it and its like hold on Ive got a call hey whats up Mom Ill call you back you look great by the way and thats what its going to look like and these show you that these reveal that Im like as a geek that was the thing Ive been looking for forever and they did it right here on a product that has like a product that is so new this has been out for 12 hours and I felt it so I dont know that I recommend you should buy one of these at 4 000 because I can promise you this this will be the worst Vision Pro Apple ever ships it is going to get so much better all right and maybe Ill make another video that thats that that makes more sense of this Music but in summary by Apple stock cuz this is without a doubt a new product category that they will see through,127.44113029827315,interacting,0.0,1.0,UvkgmyfMPks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvkgmyfMPks

when I was an adult a real adult and it would worry me all day and all night its probably why I drink so Music much where are we going Candace I dont know I dont know fancy C where are we going I didnt understand what he said its open thats give me the rundown where are we Candace in a empty restaurant I think my biggest worry now is time is now time is running out and Im on the Im you really

think so yeah why is there a swimming pool in the restaurant it doesnt any water well I think its off seon probably in the summer time this place is obviously J Pack how many seats they Music have when youre younger so you asked me the difference between then and now when youre younger theres an innocence and a naive naive uh ignorance almost to thinking big like when youre a teenager and youre think oh peace youre like yeah I can get it I can solve the world problem can solve The Worlds problems and then you get older and youre like no I cant and Im going to focus on my family and I think thats why its like Im glad that we have a little family to take care of keeps you sane yeah you start to understand and appreciate what you actually can contribute exactly to the world yeah sometimes the greatest impact is controlling like the mess in your bedroom and it makes you feel Music better isnt this so pretty what was it what does a trip like this mean when in your 20 in my 20s it was

great um Im not religious at all but Im Jewish Im a very proud Jew and Ive always been aware of my jewishness when I was a little kid it was holidays at Nanas house it was going to synagogue on holidays because that meant I got to skip school uh when I was a little bit older like maybe when I was a teenager I remember Steven Spielbergs Epic movie Schindlers List coming out and I remember like I remember very specifically watching that movie understanding that that film was like a very true to life depiction of things that actually happened here on planet Earth a a graphic iny face representation of the Holocaust and I remember watching that movie and thinking like why didnt the Jews just stop being Jewish so they wouldnt get shot I didnt understand then that to be a Jew that thats your ethnicity and to hate someone because theyre Jewish is not to hate a People based on their actions or their politics or who they choose as their God but its to hate them because of who they are and and watching that movie even as a kid I I never understood why the bad guys hated them so much it made no sense to me and Im older now and maybe just slightly less naive but to hate a people just because of who they are still doesnt make any sense to me I dont get it and look the situation in the Middle East is complicated and to call it complicated is a wild over simplification its a conflict thats thousands of years old its a conflict you can read about in the Bible the Romans fought over Jerusalem the first world war the Bal for declaration the second world war 1948 1967 1973 1982 and on and on its nuanced its complicated and despite the worlds very best efforts for peace no no one seems to be able to figure it out I certainly dont understand it it is too complicated for me whats not complicated though is what happened last Saturday when members of Hamas set out on a mission with a singular goal to kill as many Jews as possible they murdered raped mutilated kidnapped Jewish women Grandmas kids kids and entire families and look war war has existed for all of human history and all war is violence theres not much morality in any of it but theres a reason why history singles out the truly reprehensible and when it comes to walking door Todo shooting families in their homes or killing 260 young people an electronic dance music festival um a lot of those 26 60 innocent young people were shot in the back as they were running away kidnapping a young woman violently raping her and then parading her through the streets to cheering crowds or uh or or finding out yesterday confirmed report that uh about 40 dead babies were were discovered some of them still in their cribs theres no moral equivalency here theres no yeah but theres no just justifying that kind of barbarism because of a cause it is horror and demonic and the very worst that humans any humans are capable of and Im making this video not because Im the best person to deliver this information read the news if you want to know whats going on I do not have a deep understanding of the geopolitical situation in the Middle East or some naive answer to a conflict that is thousands of years old and despite this awesome t shirt that I have on uh you know Im not here to give the peace sign and say cant we all just get along Im making this video to be as vocal as possible uh in in calling out anti Semitism when I see it anti Semitism that is to hate Jewish people simply because of who they are Jewish wanting peace for Palestinians thats not anti semitic questioning or criticizing the Israeli government or its leaders for their action that is not inherently anti semitic thats thats an important dialogue that everyone concerned should be engaged it but what happened what happened Saturday was not motivated by a desire for land or Freedom or any political agenda it was about killing Jews Hamas the perpetrators of of that violence Hamas has a singular Mission and theyre not secretive about it um you can read hamass Charter its online you got to dig around but you can find it online and that Charter makes it clear its not about land its not about helping the people of Palestine live prosperous or happy lives it is about killing Jews these are not Freedom Fighters theyre racist murderers the day of judgment will not come about until fight Jews and kill them then the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees and the rocks and trees will cry out theres a Jew hiding behind me come and kill him that is a that is a poorly translated but direct quote from the Hamas Charter a publicly stated goal of the murderers so when I see on social media um especially by post by people that I know attempts at justifying the acts of these Savages by by equivocating it um activists so calleded activists rushing to say there are reasons why its okay that those families were murdered or or or people who can look at a video of a girl being pulled out of a truck with blood pouring from her pants after shes been gang raped and say say all resistance is Justified my question is like on what grounds do you make such claims have you no Humanity can you not separate the desire for peace or land or whatever your goals might be from these heinous acts like where do you have to go in your brain before you can stop seeing them murder of babies in their cribs as just that murders of babies and instead see it as just It is incomprehensible to me the people who who marched the day after the attacks holding up a sign that read by any means necessary really any means look that of course there are innocent Palestinian victims out out there who need support who need a voice but Hamas the people who committed these barbaric acts theyre not serving those people thats not their goal their mission is singular its to kill people because of who they are because theyre Jewish and look I know a lot of a lot of folks are are scared to speak up or or speak out in support of their Jewish friends because is a complicated situation nobody wants to say the wrong thing but know that that Jewish people know that your Jewish friends when they see scenes like this thats a thats a large group of people chanting gas the Jews in Sydney Australia like 2 days ago when they see scenes like that what hurts what hurts Jewish people more than those scenes is when non jew are silent when their peers are too afraid to speak out against that kind of blatant hatred that kind of blatant anti Semitism all right these videos I dont like making these videos these are my least favorite kind of videos to make,148.30188679245282,incomprehensible,0.0,-1.0,kVHGhdUDjPU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVHGhdUDjPU

10 simple Tricks to Not get Divorced,2023-06-16T13:51:20Z,12.233333333333333,1928989,90811,hey um are you in a good mood sure because this video only works if youre in a good mood okay come on 2011 this camera is 12 years old Music thank you Music all right how you doing okay all right are you ready to find out the concept heres the concept Candace and Caseys 10 tips for a successful relationship we could do this right ten fine just 10 well I think can I do number one so the ten tips no you gotta put Focus here Candace number one for the 10 tips is you have to spend time alone together theres no focus on each other when were not alone if see thats good okay my brains not working right now all right whats not whats another tip Candace we have to come up with nine more Music laughing what if you dont think your partners funny whats the hardest part of being married whats the hardest part of a long relationship not getting not not thinking that all the things that were Charming when you first met are not still Charming I think that counts so like the things that you think are cute with me you still think are cute youre not like oh my God that I still think youre cute seven more tips you didnt tell me that this was like a test um Music oh limited edition wow oh yeah thats special okay Ive got Ive got a big one Ive got a very unsexy one but its a very big one you have to be patient what you think thats generic what whats wrong thats a really good one I know but youre kind of tips for things that we arent really good at doing well here yes we are you think were patient with each other no we almost got divorced seven months ago and if there wasnt any patience there any resolved by either of us to be like all right lets just chill out for like    five minutes and try to figure this out thats patience I guess so and then we figured it out yeah very patient its okay this is the big one that its really like obtuse in its concept but its really important and its work like tips six through ten what are we on four through ten yeah look this whole thing it says 10 tips okay but you cant use up all six of them lets change it lets just keep Lets uh theres one tip and then theres sub tips okay well get this one and then theres one a b c d e f g h i okay go there whats this heavy tip work is so much work so under work comes making time for yourself that takes work finding each others still funny it actually does take work because you have to like train your brain to be like that was cute when we first met which means its so cute now instead of being annoyed it takes work to not being annoyed it takes work to be patient Music it takes work to find a therapist so you dont get divorced it takes work we go to marriage counseling and I think people who dont understand therapy or have never experienced therapy they think of it as like this heavy thing this is what marriage counseling is its fighting with a referee whos smarter than both of you right and then you leave and youre like that made sense and usually the ref doesnt pick a winner it just helps you understand what the two of you are fighting over right how many did we go through because Dr P wouldnt take us anymore we got fired by one of our therapists foreign Music no I just think this should get its own card work yes thats it should be the only card and if you dont want to put in the work then dont be in a relationship someone very close to me my father just told me that if he had to do it all over again he would be a bachelor because its too hard to be married and have kids her dad literally said this weekend if I could do it over again I wouldnt have he said this to his daughter he said hed sail and hed get a new Porsche every year and his life would be easy see I think and maybe its easy because were having a good day today I think the work is worth it yeah every time theres a dark shadow you think its a shark its definitely not for everybody I will say that I used to judge people when I was in my 20s whod say they didnt want to have kids and Id be like thats just weird now that Im married with kids I get it and when my father said that to me I wasnt even mad I was like yeah that would be nice I do think this thing that Ive made a video about before is so critical its a Venn diagram yeah yes it is see cute still cute I think this is so critical and when I speak with friends who are married and theyre having strife I attribute it to a lack of respect for this which is Ive explained this stupid forecast but this is me maintaining my sense of self and my work and my friend like my own life you with your own life and then together we share this relationship and where it gets Troublesome is when it becomes like one sort of relationship messy Circle and you give up your sense of self and I give up my sense of self and you sacrifice that for the relationship I think that is extremely detrimental but this this requires a lot of this right yeah Music tip number eight that had to be five in there maybe yeah tip number eight this is so much pressure its just like a quiz okay I have a tip respect each others pet peeves you cannot internalize it when someone doesnt like it when you leave your underwear on the floor Music oh yeah except for the fact that I dont understand why its so important to you to load the dishwasher after every single dish okay but but when a partner has a pet peeve that you think is unimportant because its just frivolous but its so important to that partner it could be simple like please put the pen caps on it drives me    crazy and youre like thats stupid Im not fighting over no you have to do that but when you put the pen cap on the partner feels heard and respected and its like you hear it and you internalize it Music number nine oh Im supposed to come up with another one yeah what does she tell us in therapy when we had that huge blowout fight and we like wanted to cancel the trip and you could tell we were like past our minutes with her and she just kept looking around shes like guys I hate to leave it at this but were out of time she said life is short if lightning were to strike today and and you were gone would I really give a    about the fact that we were fighting over dishes or something stupid like life is short and that is tip number nine life is short let the little things go Applause Music I have a good hand is it good enough to be tip number 10 its good enough whenever I see old pictures of us like when we were like dating or whatever well we were young and beautiful yeah it makes me love you so much I dont know so maybe if youre having a bad day go back in your phone or if youre old like us go back into your pictures and look at a cute picture of yourselves when you really liked each other Music Applause Music Applause a friend lizard dont be sad I know you will but dont give up Music thank you Music cant find you Music who love is searching too Music but dont give up and tell true love Music this ones a secret okay lets see the secret one where do you want me to show it show me I cant put that on camera laughs okay

Creative POISON,2023-04-28T19:49:04Z,10.266666666666667,1544269,71990,Music what are you doing up there I guess Im just procrastinating Music she had like I have like this brand deal like this is a sponsored video I have this brand deal and Im like this is really important and Ive been procrastinating this for like two weeks procrastinated Music see procrastination is dangerous Music procrastination poisons productivity right now if I didnt procrastinate I could have this job this video done by the end of the day Im gonna Im gonna go get lunch see I I think I spend 50 of my time procrastinating fifty percent of my time not working and then the other 50 of my time frantically working to make up for the time that I spent not working whats for lunch he said he wants chicken got chicken Music its great intentions to sabotage by compulsive inaction thank you Music how do you deal with procrastination I embraced it I go with it what does that mean s wait until I cant wait anymore and then go really fast I dont know if that advice of waiting until the last minute to do things I dont know if thats good advice and I think about I think about the times when I made like feature films like a movie thats taken three or four years of my life for these huge projects and how much Ive struggled with them because I lose focus I lose interest they stop they stop being interesting to me but then like when I had my daily Vlog I had a deadline every single day there was no opportunity within those years theres no opportunity for me to procrastinate and it worked do you see do you see my facial hair see much longer my beard is now than it was in the previous shots thats because I its been a week that procrastinated this from a week this is a movie about procrastination that Ive Ive been procrastinating for a week Music hey dude just this and this please foreign Music this this is how I would describe the entirety of my professional life its either a state of boredom wherein I want to do more or a state of burnout where I need to do less its never ever in this healthy place in the middle its its one extreme or the other these two states these are destructive to the creative process and its procrastination that enables these two states so Ill procrastinate which leads to boredom to fix that I need to I need to do more which leads me to kind of burn out I need to remedy that by doing less so I start to procrastinate then I get bored I need to fix that so I frantically do more and I get stuck in this Vicious Circle Music this crazy space alien technology from insta360 is the um is the sponsor of this video and I use this thing for a lot of shots uh in this movie see how its following me its doing that by itself so I can move over here and I can even go behind the tree and it still follows me very impressive very impressive stuff Music so its called the insta360 flow and at its core it is a a three axis gimbal for for your phone but Ive had it for a few weeks now and its become something its become something more for me its like having a cameraman thats smart and does exactly as its told all by itself see 99 of my videos I just shoot by myself and Im always looking for technology or cameras or toys that help me be more efficient as like an independent filmmaker as somebody who doesnt need a camera doesnt have a cameraman and thats exactly what this does all right watch this see ya see how its not recording watch this so just uh get back raise by hand flashes this light at me now its recorded now I walk around and it follows me wherever I go even I kind of walk behind stuff or if I come over here and I hide for if I get totally close up and then when Im done its kind of raise my hand and uh look at stop stop recording its kind of amazing its a little tiny one person camera crew you know a question I get so often by up and coming creators and and people that are new to YouTube is what kind of camera should I use and my feedback is always its not the camera its how you use it in a tool like this makes a camera your phone or whatevers in your pocket it makes it a hundred times better this plus the phone that you already have is like this is a tiny little 159 dollar camera crew so nice work insta 360 this is now yet another piece of my like filmmaking gear that permanently lives in my backpack and makes my movies better insta360 flow is what its called its 159 bucks theres a link below foreign Music I dont see procrastination as something that holds me back but its something I can harness to push me forward see I know I dont have the kind of focus that it takes to like architect a huge project and dedicate three or four years of my life to realizing but Im capable of something called hyper Focus wherein if theres a project I can realize now I could dedicate everything to it and and tackle it with the kind of efficiency of a Japanese bullet train they call it attention deficit disorder and this is dead wrong its attention deficit Advantage this is my superpower no I cant focus on my health and exercise 20 minutes a day three days a week but Ive run 25 marathons I ran 70 miles last week no I dont have the focus to spend like three years on a single movie but I can make a movie today and then I can make a movie tomorrow I can do that 800 days in a row and call it a daily Vlog thats thats part of that thats thats the superpower so rather than trying to bend my gut brain to accommodate the world around me I just work to bend the world around me to benefit my fantastic brain and as far as oh as far as procrastination this is just this is a small tax a small burden a small hurdle I have to jump over in exchange for this superpower Music a lot of the um themes ideas and even like direct quotes in this video around ADHD and add a lot of those were taken from an author named Jesse J Anderson he writes about uh he writes about those things and he doesnt have very like relatable humorous way so if any of this kind of stuck with you or felt familiar to you or any of these ideas uh discussed in the video you should definitely check him out hes got a

The Greatest Moment,2023-01-27T14:38:20Z,7.883333333333334,1447322,64512,Music foreign the greatest moment of my life not including like when my kids were born or like my wedding day or any of those important things okay the greatest moment of my life happened to be captured on camera in my daily vlog the day I got my first boosted board so fast so boosted board the company went out of business right around the same time that we decided to move back to New York City and I had this I had this Bleak realization that someday in the not too distant future I will both be living in New York City and all my boosted boards will be dead Bleak so I decided then and there to build out a boosted board Surplus that would last me for the rest of my life a lifetime boosted Surplus I need to prepare for 33 years of boosting uh it means I need uh that means I need about 11 board so let me walk you through my current boosted board inventory these four are my my daily drivers four boards fully charged ready to go at at all times these these are my dead boards none of these work Music I sought out any remaining dead stock that is like brand new boards that you could still buy and then I bought all of them but you see how thats blinking like that thats an error message this never before written boosted board does not function maybe it can be fixed maybe that battery needs to be replaced two two of my last six Irreplaceable brand new unopened boosted boards two dont function at all these guys here theyre toast and today January 24th in the year of Our Lord 2023 today today Im giving one of these away Im giving one away to a most extraordinary friend because he just completed something that literally no human has ever done before its an amazing story Music hows your confidence level its a little too good hes flying oh my God I love you um Jericho whats your background how far back give me the long one and then Ill edit this okay so long one uh my dad was in the Army so I was an Army rat I grew up all over the world I lived in Korea Germany all over the United States um and then when I was 17 years old I joined the army and I spent 20 years as an Army Ranger um I deployed Iraq and Afghanistan a number of times um and then since retiring Ive kind of just done whatever I wanted um that put me into like some freelance journalism opportunities some film producing some film Tech advising um Music so why I interrupted you there Jericho is because Jericho and I met on set for project power which is the Jamie Foxx movie and he was there to make sure everybody was handling their like the fake prop Firearms correctly right right and I was just there because Im friends with the directors and they gave me a spot in their movie which they will never ever do again so that was a nightmare on set look look at that its me wait no thats Jamie Foxx thats me thats me thats me this is the movie that uh Jericho and I both worked on and Jericho why is uh why is Your Parachute why is your parachute on my couch Erica theyre the whoa theyre the parachutes that I used during our most recent Adventure where we went and skydived onto all seven continents in the shortest amount of time possible Jericho I was trying to set this up as like the big thing that you did that Im trying to share with my audience you just glossed over the fact that you the non former US and Canadian military service members broke three World Records no one else has ever done before a world record and I think maybe the most important detail is like the the why why the why um because we all know I mean as people are watching this video we all know you have to do something kind of a little bit Jazzy to get attention and fundraising for non profits is extremely difficult but then to make them click again to donate super hard so we wanted to do something really special something that everyone thought would be impossible of doing it in under seven days in order to get people to follow along and watch and the more they follow along and watched and the more they like got on board with their team the more that they would want to donate to this organization now this was all done to raise money for scholarships for children of Fallen service members looking to financially support families of Fallen Special Operations soldiers get an education 100 of all the donations will be going to folds of Honor thats called the folds of Honor uh foundation and they provide scholarships to kids whose parent was killed or severely disabled during the course of the last 20 years of our nation being at War foreign Music what was your favorite was Cairo your favorite the the time under canopy in Cairo is my favorite but my actual favorite favorite jump was the one in Barcelona because it was just uh super illegal so thats it thats why Im this whole video by the way is about me giving you a boosted board oh sweet so thats why thats why Im I wanted to give Jericho that boosted board I mean I would have given it to him anyway but the fact that you and and your team did such an unbelievable thing and not just for vanity but to raise money for an unbelievably important cause is pretty special special enough for a fun YouTuber like me to give you one of my skateboards Jericho Im your favorite skateboarding yeah Music um so Im gonna put Im gonna put all the information below by the way um for the fundraiser for to to help these children of military personnel that were um disabled or killed in combat wonderful cause if you can donate uh just click the link below foreign Music over Antarctica but how is the boosted board ride its just as good its just as good it is just as good it may not be us once in a lifetime but its just as good foreign

3 things i learned from 800 days of vlogging,2022-12-05T21:57:09Z,6.516666666666667,1860575,72609,800 thats how many days in a row I uploaded a video from my daily Vlog 800 days Music its been its been like five years since I stopped daily vlogging and I think about it all the time and I think I think the thing that I think about the most is like the how of it like how what was what were the days like when I was living that life now all I want is like some degree of normalcy in my life you you spend your 20s figuring it out you spend your 30s doing it and then you spend your 40s enjoying it and Im Im right on that threshold Im 41 now and I want to enjoy it its like Im not interested in that manic life anymore but now that I can see it in retrospect with some clarity this is the inner uh this is what I think of when I think of those days so like the thing I think about the most the thing that occurs to me the most was the headspace required to come up with a fresh video every day and what I mean by that is like as long as youre focused on what is my video today then are you ever really like present in whats happening in your actual life if I need to uh I need to vacuum the studio right now because its filthy in here and my brain goes to a place immediately of like can I make this part of the Vlog Music oh thank you so much thank you so much I appreciate that now when it comes to something like vacuuming obviously obviously thats inconsequential but what about when its like a date with the wife what about when its like a vacation with my family you know then it becomes a very different consideration and for the first like I dont know a couple hundred episodes maybe for the first year it wasnt even a consideration it was just go go go like everything is content get it all but towards the end and absolutely now looking back at it you realize like if you externalize like if you put out there on in a video if you take from your inside and put it out into the world every aspect of your life youre kind of left with like what what am I like what whats left whats just for me am I a phony for exploiting the ever living out of my life every aspect of my life in the name of subject matter for my videos Music so that kind of ever present question of like does being a daily lifestyle vlogger make me a fraud that got more and more like pervasive towards the end of what a big part of the reason why I stopped and I dont miss that but there are aspects of the daily Vlog game that I miss so much Music as a filmmaker or YouTuber or whatever theres this constant question of like should I make something now today should I make something and if the answer is yes what should that something be and the magic of that daily Vlog was that that question was always answered like the goal posts were so well defined and theres something about that Clarity of purpose in a place like YouTube where there is no Clarity at all theres its all ambiguity that Clarity of purpose is something I miss so much foreign Music still a mess Music Music foreign we got a loose dog headed down Broadway full speed Music Music dont be frightened come on its okay come on its okay sweet boy no no no no no please dont I dont know Ive been trying to catch it for five bucks Music so we got the dog back a Good Samaritan caught it and returned it to the owner that was so dramatic yeah to finish my story like the learnings from the Vlog the takeaway from all that is now as I re embarked here on YouTube my goal is to draw less from my personal life less introspective more looking out like what do I see versus so thats thats how I look at YouTube now it feels great,111.25319693094629,inconsequential,0.0,1.0,KehujfbRBts,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KehujfbRBts
Elon Musk's Six Rules for Tesla Employees,2022-11-29T13:37:53Z,3.25,1846219,80521,a couple days ago some random person on internet tweeted Elon reportedly sent this mail to Tesla employees to which Elon responded correct good thread I thought I would memorialize the content of that thread here in a video titled Elon musks six rules for Tesla employees lets begin number one avoid large meetings large meetings waste valuable time and energy they discourage debate people are more guarded than open and theres not enough time for everyone to contribute dont schedule large meetings unless you are certain they provide value to everyone two leave a meeting if youre not contributed if a meeting doesnt require your input value or decisions then your presence is useless its not rude to leave a meeting but it is rude to waste peoples time three forget the chain of command communicate with colleagues directly not their supervisors or managers fast communicators make fast decisions and fast decisions equal a competitive advantage four be clear not clever avoid nonsense words and Technical jargon it slows down communication choose words that are concise to the point and easy to understand dont try to sound smart be efficient five ditch frequent meetings there is no better way to waste everyones time than frequent meetings use meetings to collaborate attack issues head on and to solve urgent problems but once you resolve the issue frequent meetings are no longer necessary and you can resolve most issues without a meeting at all instead of a meeting send a text send an email or communicate on a Discord or slack Channel dont interrupt your teams workflow unless its absolutely necessary six use common sense if a company rule doesnt make sense contribute to progress or apply to your specific situation then avoid that rule all together in general dont follow rules follow principles and then um that was it that was like thats the end of the thats the end of the text thread,99.6923076923077,communicators,0.0,0.9,i4GJnpOZmiM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GJnpOZmiM
the Greatest Gift,2022-11-25T16:13:52Z,10.466666666666667,1839801,70976,ready Music out of the fish tanks leaking okay foreign Music Music Music all right they should be here any minute I dont see them yet Music oh thats gotta be them so let me just explain what this whole thing was supposed to be its like two months ago I did this thing with Joby the company that makes the microphone that I use where they would pick where Joby would pick five creators from like I dont know around the world a handful of different countries and theyd fly them here and like the grand prize that these five creators get to make a video with me Music I got a lot of fans in here oh you guys gotta put no scrap down back these guys all won a contest to fly to New York and like make a video with me now that sort of makes sense but as like the date neared and I really thought about it I wasnt quite sure what to do then these creators showed up and they were awesome lets take these guys to one of my favorite restaurants in all of New York City get the ginger chicken or the roast pork excuse me but then we started talking I thought rather than like taking our precious one day together all the time we had one day rather than taking that time to focus on my video instead let me give each of these creators as much of my time as possible to work on their video for their YouTube channel and that thats what we did are you feeling ready to start your project um I think Ive done this absolutely well see kind of nervous kind of good were good locked in oh yeah I appreciate the confidence Music Im having a great day are you having a good day Music this is it greatest camera store in the world its this whole city block greatest camera store on the planet so what what video are you making while youre here Im making a vlog about my experiences George I brought you a special gift and thats your video yeah yeah the gift is the video so Im filming three different things but the main one thats going to be on YouTube is the Journey of getting to ride a boosted board with you because its a dream since Ive had since I was 30 so were going to figure that out at some point but you know Music its like a toy store its like an amusement park its like Disneyland if youre a film Music oh my gosh hi how does it feel I think I feel okay thats uh thats Haruki Haruki and I well Haruki had a great idea he said he had a fear of heights he wanted me to help him overcome that fear of heights Music weve got an hour why dont we just climb out of the window of my office and well go up to the roof fear of heights that we overcame by climbing to the roof of this building that was a good little shoot yeah so when I when I first moved to New York City like as a young Casey I had no money whatsoever and I would come to this store just to look at and fantasize about all the equipment in here and what I could do with that equipment and like the whole someday Ill be able to get that camera thing here 20 years ago 19 year old Casey thats what foreign Music Music so to go from being that kid who used to come in here just to Window Shop just to peruse whats that thats good thats me right anyway thats where I was going with this whole story now they put me on the wall in here look at that guy George how do I characterize your YouTube channel aquariums fish Id say series meets animals maybe no no way this is crazy Ive had an idea for this style of a video before but I this Im so out of my comfort zone Music him and his team made that fish tank and his video is about like gifting me that fish tank great concept George great fish tank now I thought I fixed that leak but I didnt and I do have fish now uh the fish have to stay separate so dont kill each other so I built a tank within a tank out of a glass water bottle their names are Edward and Edward theyre great fish over the camera were going to do something nice she wanted to make uh like an instructional video as to how to do a be real since Im not on be real she taught me how to do it first there it is this this is what this whole campaign was for jobys their new microphone I have to say its been the only microphone Ive used for I dont know my last 20 videos and the thing is Stellar its Stellar its a perfect YouTuber microphone some features they really want me to highlight it has noise canceling so if its like chaos behind you itll bring that down it records two audio tracks one audio track thats 10 decibels lower in case you have like a lot of peaking itll give you a nice clean track along with that and then this is clutch its got a little LED on the front of the microphone to tell you if the battery is dead or if its on or if its off its as if the gods over at Joby were listening when I made all those videos complaining about microphones and they made one just for me just what I wanted whats up this is like a clip from the video that I made with the niche I also took this picture of him right here thanks for the credit my brother that was fun though right that was fun yeah that was fun the whole experience was something special for me and I Know It was supposed to be about them and not about me but like this whole YouTube thing that I do its just its just Im alone I work alone this is a very lonely this is a very like and doing this project forced me to like break out of that shell and I think why I loved it so much as well we spent like a day it was like a day and a half together we spent this time together we were talking about making videos the whole time were talking about making the whole time but never once in those two days day and after we talk about like how do you get more likes how do you get more subscribers how do I grow my follower account how do I be like a more how do I make more money as an influencer we didnt talk about any of that because I hate that stuff but thats not what this was this was just about it was just about that act of making Im gonna link below

"Kanye, you broke my heart",2022-10-25T19:56:51Z,13.783333333333333,2821635,176012,I miss the old Kanye this straight from the go Kanye the chop up the soul Kanye the set on his goals Kanye I hate this new Kanye the bad mood Kanye the always rude Kanye the spaz in the news Kanye the racist anti semi Kanye I hate that I have to make this video I dont want to make this video I want to make another fun goofy little video about how much I love New York City ah but I open up Twitter and every other tweet is about Adidas dropping Kanye I open up Instagram and every post is someone saying I stand with my Jewish friends so when Im on my run this morning my dark cold rainy run my time its a time of the day when Im um thinking Im incubating ideas its when I come up with all of my thoughts so that I then try to form and Patty into videos I have this block and I have this block because all I can think about is the hatred that this guy is spewing the damage that its causing I fixate on the fact that here we are in 2022 and by all quantifiable metrics anti Semitism that is the hostility towards all Jewish people is on the rise and Kanye West one of the biggest stars on the planet is doing his part to thin the Flames of hatred towards an entire group of people okay look this is me Music this is me here on this is me on my wedding day this is my nice Jewish bride this is me and this little pink funny little hat right here that is called a keepa here is a picture of my younger brother US Air Force Captain D neistat now retired this is him flying his jet this is Dean here judging by his Kevlar and the fact that he is has a has a gun this is probably in Afghanistan Music uh this is another picture of Dean again hes armed here so hes probably somewhere down range and then heres a heres a picture of Dean my little brother hes in Kabul right there welcome to Kabul now why does a a Jewish guy like me wear a keepa at my wedding uh why is that Jewish guy like my little brother wear one even when hes at War the truth is I dont know um I had actually looked that up on on Wikipedia it has something to do with like honoring God by having something between you and God I dont know the reason why I dont know Im not religious uh I only went to shul shul is what you call Jewish church I only went to shore when I was a kid like once a year with my nana because I wanted to skip school and it was a great excuse but none of that makes me any less Jewish and thats because Judaism is an ethno religion and what that means is for most Jewish people youre born Jewish and you dont get to choose whether youre Jewish any more than a black person chooses whether theyre black and while my feelings about religion are are um undefined Im immensely proud of my Jewish background and Heritage so for you to spew that kind of hatred it doesnt matter if its anti Semitism or old fashioned racism like the time he said slavery was a choice or when he said Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves he said those things he said those things with a camera in his face or whatever other like white supremacist garbage he was going on and on about in these interviews that are now going viral all over the Internet its all the same its all hate speech and what that kind of hate speech does when communicated by someone of his stature with his bully pulpit it tells other people other people of compromised Integrity not people like you or me people who are harboring prejudices of their own it gives them permission to also get out there and spread hate thats why its called the dog whistle is because to good people people like us I hear ignorance I hear stupidity I hear Hate by a guy who is has mental health issues but to others those dangerous hateful people in the margins what they hear is something very different to them its permission to to get out there and throw a banner over the 405 freeway in Los Angeles that says Kanye is Right while they stand on the bridge next to it giving the hail Hitler salute to everyone driving by that that literally happened yesterday in LA now let me tell you why this hurts so much why this hurts me so much Kanye was great Kanye was great now I dont know Kanye I dont know him currently or ever but I did meet the guy on a couple of occasions so like 2002 maybe 2003 way back when this is before his first album College Dropout came out and I want to say this was before Jesus Walks which I think was his first single this is before that came out this girl I knew invited me to go to the Hammer scene Ballroom here in New York City um she had these backstage passes because she was working with like one of the artists performing or something so we go and like okay early 2000s hip hop then rap then was still pretty hardcores like gangster stuff if you were a rapper you were tough and Im like this white kid backstage and then in walks this like mild mannered guy and I remember it was Kanye I remember he had on a polo shirt and it was like a pastel green or a pink or something and he had on a backpack like I remember that and we hung around backstage he was cool we didnt have much whatever hes cool and then the whole group of us like Kanye is Entourage which I was sort of a part of for weird circumstantial reasons we all walked to the stage Kanye led us out of that room and he was the first to open the door this this I remember first opened the door and he stood there holding the door open for all of us to walk past and like I was like the last or one of the last people to walk by and I remember being like thanks dude I like walked by the guy okay we go on stage I go on stage Kanye starts performing hes doing his thing all of his like the girls the guys the people around him theyre all like getting into it theyre all in the Rhythm Kanyes there and hes just like you know hes Kanyes doing Kanye and hes up there just like letting the audience have it Im the only white guy on that stage and I dont know how to dance I dont know how to dance ever and Im like I just remember like Im on the stage and the audience can definitely see me they can positive and like Im just trying to like find the Rhythm and dance and like like this is kind of how I dance I dont really know how to dance and I remember it was like really embarrassing and weird but I was psyched to be on the stage with this guy because he just seemed so cool and so confident I was embarrassing and amazing all at once that was the first time I met Kanye I still dont know how to dance by the way okay a decade later by now Kanye has become Kanye and Im at like this dinner party it was for this artist friend of mine Tom had a like an after party for his art show Kanye was there so go over to him and Im like yo Kanye let me tell you a story and I tell him the story I just told you and hes like oh I remember that and theres no    way he remembers that but he was kind and he said I remember that Im like honey what are you up to now very good to see what are you up to and hes like oh Im on tour with my group you should come see us his group by the way was him and Jay Z On The Watch the Throne tour and he did like he followed through he like sent me tickets I went and saw him the next time it was great anyway Im like cool youre on tour what else are you up to and hes like well Im getting into fashion Im like tell me more tell me more and he just starts going off about his ideas for fashion and lets start designing clothing just he just keeps rattling off what he wants to do and hes like getting really excited about it he loses me completely no idea what this guy is talking about but the passion and hes just going and like I know the look I must have been giving him in that in that moment must have been like the look that Candace my wife gives me when I start telling her an idea for a video its like an idea that made perfect sense in his head total sense in his head in his brain but to me I just it was like utter nonsense look look look look look Ill show you I got a picture look look this was us look thats look at how happy he is you ever seen such a happy Kanye he was psyched because Im like tell me about your fashion plans were homies and then he did it he did it all all those ideas he told me he did see Kanye is one of those rare few where he was an artist first some musicians are just musicians some musicians are like businessmen um others are performers and its like YouTubers like some YouTubers are are cinematographers or photographers some YouTubers are influencers or personalities some very few are artists and Kanye was an artist he made art whether it was fashion or music it was it was it was made without a consideration of what his peers were doing he wasnt trying to fit in or follow some path defined by others who had already found success in the same in the same space he defined his own path that documentary on HBO called Gene yes um first episode theres this scene in that documentary and in that scene Kanye West is is he like he has a contract then with Rockefeller records but theyre not following through theyre kind of screwing him over and he busts into Rockefeller records offices like goes in there and his intention is to show whoever will hear him he wants to play his new single so hes playing all falls down for this woman watch look at that she doesnt know how to react so shes shes laughing and look look at that look he knows she didnt care she didnt like it she did not approve he knows that now I dont know what was going on obviously I dont know whats going on in that room I dont know what that woman was thinking but what it looks like is she didnt know how to react heres this guy hes got a new sound hip hop then meant one thing and this did not fall into that Norm so of course she didnt know how to react his art was unprecedented but he knew he knew it was good he didnt care if you didnt like it or not because not liking hit not liking it didnt make him wrong it just it just meant it just showed that you couldnt see they couldnt see what he could see and that is what made him time and time again not just a musician not just a designer but an artist that song by the way went on to be his first top 10 solo track and it was nominated for a Grammy he had the vision and he was right even though he was literally laughed out of that office thank you but thats why this all hurts so much because that Journey that art is so rare its generational it has the it has the power to inspire an entire generation it tells a generation that you can if you believe you can and and look Kanye didnt invent hate speech he didnt invent anti Semitism its been around long before him and it will be around long after him what but why this breaks my heart is because as an artist or someone who who has dreams me of being an artist I I cant imagine accomplishing what he accomplished using nothing but your art and your own Brilliance to become one of the most celebrated creative forces on the planet and to do that at a time when the planet is more fractured than ever and then to stand on this stage this stage thats taller than most could ever dream of and then use that platform to to divide instead of unite to promote hate instead of promote love to to just vomit negativity instead of sharing something positive that I just dont get that Ill never get okay I will see you in a few days with a fun video it will be positive and it will be about something I

The Problem with New York City..,2022-10-11T18:23:52Z,7.233333333333333,3275030,144018,I didnt say Music there are countless highly efficient ways of getting around New York City walking obviously works but its a crowded City and its a its kind of slow for me you can run but I really only recommend this for exercise otherwise people are gonna think youre being robbed Music theres my favorite the boosted board but this this isnt for everybody Music theres uh theres City bike its only like three bucks and uh these things are everywhere foreign this is New York City so theres the subway Music the New York City subway is the best its like three bucks takes you anywhere you need to go taxi taxis are fantastic its like uber but instead of an app you just raise your hand were going to do a Broadway in Franklin and then theres the bus and I guess you could own a car you could rent a car with all of these all of these ways of getting around town they all have one thing in common which is that if you have little kids that have two little girls if you have little kids they become infinitely less practical I cant ride my skateboard with two girls getting in like the the taxi I dont have a baby seat to put the and on the subway its tough going up and down the stairs with like a stroller so like to get both kids to school we we drive them were those people Hey kid do you like driving in a car to school no yeah me neither what I need here is a transportation solution for my kids and me but first first a word from our sponsor a word from our sponsor so for the most part when Im trying to get the shot the shot falls into one of three categories one one is like the regular camera shot three three is like the the flying camera shot with it with a drone and then in between regular and drone is this area here which I call weird shots thats a weird shot these are weird shots thats a weird shot weird shots those are weird shots youve seen a lot of these weird shots like especially in my latest video and its because of this camera new insta 360 X3 which is also the sponsor of this video sort of look like a drone shot but its like a drone couldnt really do that thank you so all of those shots how Ive been getting all those shots is I just take this thing and I put it on the end of this like obscenely long selfie stick and then I just kind of like run around holding this ridiculous selfie stick Music the camera itself is pretty great it shoots like 57 K so its super high resolution its waterproof it feels great its got a high res screen on it if you want to know more about the tech specs I highly recommend watching Marquez brownlees video but overall its a great product and honestly the reason why I took this brand deal why Im making this commercial is because they sent this to me like a month ago and Ive been using it in all my videos great product highly recommend checking it out theres an affiliate link below in my description and if you use that link you get a free selfie stick which which disappears as long as you use it with the camera thats how I get these shots not the huge selfie stick but a very good a very good selfie stick thats still pretty long the noise in here Music Applause relentless in an event check out the insta360 the um the uh the affiliate link is below now back to the transportation issue so despite all those great ways to get around its still a pain getting around with kids this this is part of the solution yeah and this this is the other part of the solution Music foreign Music Music Music thank you foreign this is a Bicycle Built for three one normal sized human here two tiny humans here its electric Music its a Bicycle Built for free are you excited yeah should we go for a ride Music and this The Bicycle Built for three might be the most perfect means of transport Music thank you,102.44239631336406,transportation,0.0,1.0,fIdRWKel0xQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIdRWKel0xQ

watch it for a minute and then the car was gone he doesnt even have the keys so wheres the car I dont know Im uh Im going to going to Brooklyn this morning and Im in Brooklyn this uh this is gonna sound funny but Im in Brooklyn looking for mischief Mischief magazine this this is your magazine okay what is Mischief I mean its Art Collective for just making it yeah art how much time do we have left um I I we got 30 minutes until it goes all right lets go Music saying to me in detail what is this thing all right I mean so this is this is a car we have we we were selling a bunch of keys to this one car so well be able anybody that has a key can drive it can pick it up everyone anyone can find out where it is location wise um we basically weve rebuilt the companys Zipcar if they only had one vehicle yeah foreign your website launches in 11 minutes and for 20 bucks anybody in the world can buy a key to this car yeah but theres only one car and then everybody has to share it yeah theres only one car so what do you do if like somebody I dont know if somebody like crashes it well find out when it happens what if somebody gets pulled over by the cops or gets like a thousand dollars in speeding tickets what do you do what does somebody do if the cops say license and registration what does the person who has this due the registration is in the book Department Music hello from g4all the car is currently moving the car is located at the latitudes 407185 and longitude so you get that information and then you just can go and just take the car how do you keep people from just chasing you down I mean thats thats faster do you have any can I buy a key um so this is the instruction manual has everything you need and then youve got your key fob and your keychain itll be blue and then green and so I can just take it yeah yeah yeah all right see you guys later Music Marlon I got this car for 20 bucks 20 bucks 20 bucks Ill give you 15 for it right now all right 15 Ill give you this car okay look this is where things went just terribly wrong Im like kind of bsing with Marlin here and look at this guy over his shoulder see this guy right here this very interested guy that guy expressed clearly that he was interested in the car and I like its off camera but I explained to him that its like not actually mine but if you you know if you want to borrow it you can take it and Im like its like listen look and they made 5 000 keys to this car like the cameras pointed down so I you know I explained to him its not actually my car but a bunch of thousands of people have the keys and if he wants it though he can borrow the car and then I consult with my dear friend Marlin should I should I give the car to this guy give the guy the call and then decision was made Ill let this guy take the car but I say to him uh its yours just give me one minute all right and I needed a minute because I had like all my bags on me so I need to like throw my stuff in my office grab a can of spray paints I wanted to spray paint the car and then take myself out of the car I I forgot my stuff was in the car I should have no but my stuff was in the car I just wasnt thinking and maybe the most critical piece here I didnt realize I had left the car running even though I had the key and then I and then I went back outside thank you brother what happened to the car you know Im gonna call I came out as gone I told that kind of way right there probably the guy took the call I said wave I have like my phone in it unbelievable the guy took the call he took the car what do I do why are you laughing at me now its not technically stolen because I did tell that guy he could have it but I didnt tell him to take it I said wait my phone was in the car so I like looked up a friend find a guys on the highway somewhere Im worried the dude just like got into the tunnel and left because I dont see a PT Cruiser needle in a haystack I gotta go back home and rethink this whole thing my boosted battery died but I found whats your name appreciate it hes giving me a towel back at the studio with every minute that goes by losing a little bit more and again I dont care about the car its that my phone was in there I left it running and I kind of told the guy he could have it but then I just said watch it for a minute and then the car was gone he doesnt even have the keys so wheres the car I dont know can you track the car I have no phone I cant do anything it was my fault that was really stupid that I left my phone and my other skateboard and all my stuff in the car when I went inside I dont know what I was thinking I called one of the guys for Mischief were taking my car to go try to recover my phone and my skateboard and maybe even just recover the PT Cruiser I mean I still have the key either this totally failed or this worked way too well Im totally serious Music so are we stealing the car back yeah yeah we have we have to were just gonna take it were taking the car yeah Music princess like if hes like its my car now Im serious Music are you guys ready do we need to plan are we good I mean I think lets just roll up on the situation and see whats up should it should be right up here on the right its right there its right there you see it yeah there it is its right right there yeah oh my God I see it okay hold on yo you just took off I said wait I said wait look this things got strange here like there was nothing hostile about the interaction with this guy like he was totally chill but it was awkward like he I told him he could take the car he like he didnt break any laws or anything but I he also kind of knew that he shouldnt have taken the car and also like he had my cell phone in his hand when we pulled up look look look thats my phone in the end I was just happy that the guy was cool and I had a sense of humor about it and we didnt care because we had stolen the car back anyway and this whole thing was fun and I got my stuff back and my skateboard back so like no hard feelings but it was very awkward so thanks for that thanks for not reporting and stolen yeah Ill see you later yo thanks man take care I dont know it seemed very odd the whole

how this BLIND SURFER GOT 1MILLIONS SUBSCRIBERS IN A MONTH,2022-09-15T16:26:48Z,9.333333333333334,1245910,74193,see uh See this thing this is made by a company called Joby Joby they also make this microphone this video is sponsored by Joby see you sir and youre blind how does that work well the ocean talks its pretty loud today I just gotta learn how to listen I first learned about Pete on Instagram I found his account a couple years ago and this is what I was trying to figure out how to surf which is the hardest sport Ive ever had to learn and I was like how does this guy do it Pete hey I hear you Casey right here glad you made it its nice to finally meet you yeah come on in how did you lose your vision I was born with a degenerative eyesight disorder it ate away my central vision and then kind of worked its way out until it basically took everything from me so can you see anything I see light and dark Music Peters a fascinating guy what he does for a living is a voice over artist so he like records voiceovers for TV commercials and movies and okay okay but if you were with all your movie trailer experience if you had to do a a movie trailer for my YouTube channel what would it sound like go I go he says are we are we casting you as a hero of YouTube or are we bringing you the sensitive stories that people need to see or is it like action like Casey takes Pete Gustin surfing this weekend on YouTube you can just turn that on thats incredible what I didnt know is that he does all the recording and then the editing he does all of this by himself despite the fact that youve got Pro Tools open up here on your uh on your computer yeah do you actually edit in Pro Tools yourself gaming medicine so if I want to get rid of the words Ho Chunk gaming Madison Ive scrolled to the beginning of it Ill look the other way so I now scrolled across it and then I cut it I took out ho Chiang gamer Madison so in addition to being a a pretty decent Surfer and a world class voice over recording artist Pete also has a channel a YouTube channel this is Petes YouTube channel coming in with 141 million subscribers the videos on his YouTube channel he writes them edits them and shoots them mostly by himself tell me about your um the video YouTube video that went crazy viral Id spent all this time doing Blind Surfer stories just telling people these inspirational stories of me overcoming this challenge or that challenge and one day I I think I think my fiance like went out to dinner with the girls and I was like I dont know just kind of a funny story Ill tell people and I just remembered this time I was at the gym and before I know whats going on this woman in my face I Can Tell Shes like this far away from me because I didnt come here to be stared at and Im like like I have no concept of whats going on but quickly I put it two two and two together Im like oh she must have been in front of me and she probably thought I was like looking at her and checking her out at the gym Im like oh my bad Im like Im actually blind Im not looking at anything and the guy takes the card for a second puts it back in my hand and he goes yeah but you just cant make other gym members uncomfortable by staring at them oh my God I told that as a 60 second story and at this point story you just told me has 40 million 40 million views holy super interesting guy and Ive been wanting to make this movie about Pete for a while but Im back in New York City now so I needed like a I needed an excuse a reason to go back to California to go surfing I mean make this movie with Pete and you know every one of my Vlogs that Ive ever made this bendy tripod its made by a company named Joby and finally after years of using this I got Joby to sponsor me and in addition to Joby making the GorillaPod that I used they now make this they now make this kind of like perfect microphone for for bloggers for YouTubers and considering that like Pete is sort of an expert in all things audio it seemed like a very natural alignment thank you foreign at all Music right so this is with the Joby this is you I mean acquire car away and up close actually sounds very similar Music okay now Im gonna unplug it and youre just gonna hear the onboard youre unplugged and its terrible give me the two second review there was a million times different you wouldnt I if I were you Id be embarrassed to put on YouTube what you had without the microphone the microphone made it professional nice work job is going to be psyched okay here I put a joke I put their mic on your your GoPro nice Pete one thing I really like about filming with you is that when I turn the camera on you dont get all insecure weird I can just its pretty easy for me to pretend there is no camera on me yeah Pete because youve never seen me surf I think its important for you to understand just how good I am all right I wouldnt say Im the best surfer in the world top three yeah top three all right Im a terrible Surfer terrible Surfer in essence surfing is all about the feel I mean it would make it a million times easier if I could look forward and anticipate thats the thats the hardest part is I dont know what the waves going to do Im just reacting but if all my reactions are fast enough and I feel good then I wrote a good wave Music is it really Casey is it really good out there thats good do you know how to duck that yeah how do you know when the duck dies you listen Okay and when you hear the way of getting angry angry angry thats when you duck Pete what are you whats the stick for this is like so I want to know when the waves are coming so I hold this out in front of me and when I feel one I whip around and I drop in are you joking right now 100 joking Music so when you when you surf with Pete like how do you let him know which waves to catch back and forth where Ill be like way we got about 10 seconds start paddling speed up no wait Slow Down slow down no wait wait speed up again go faster and then Im like all right youre gonna pop up and go right in three two one and then I hope youve like doesnt hit anybody all the way down I just crossed my fingers and be like hes coming Music Pete thank you for being so generous with your story and going surfing with me and also thank you for helping me with this Joby microphone review I havent done a tech review in a while and generally when it comes to audio for me I just want something that works like I want to plug it in and know that its going to work and I think Joby nailed that they put like an LED on the front so you know that its recording its got some good features made just for vloggers they wrote right here on the box for professional vloggers I appreciate that and I am doing a bigger project with Joby where they they fly five YouTubers five creators out and here to New York City and together we like make a video where were testing out their audio and just making a video in general if thats

first major things i ever did as like a filmmaker in the world of filmmaking Applause Music see back then i had helped my friends josh and benny safty make a little movie called the pleasure of being robbed Music we were just like a bunch of like broke aspiring filmmakers and somehow we made it Music here is the executive producer of this and being here now is certainly a reminder of like how far ive come and how much ive grown up in my career and all that but also but im also hung up on this idea that like im here the most extraordinary place on the planet to present your movie to the world Music and now the place where i exist is like i sit at home in front of my computer and i present my movies to the world alone in a dark room by pressing the upload button i mean this definitely lacks the uh the glamour of a canned film festival movie premiere but i like this too Music what hair do tonight candace ponytail ponytail Music okay candaces hair and makeup and dress and i kicked her out of the room so now i can have about 20 seconds to get dressed Music look how well i tied that im just kidding its a clip on how do i look i gotta go you look great Music Music what are you doing are you taking your underwear what are you going to do with them put them in my bag Music youre not allowed to film at all on the red carpet but luckily i brought my spy glasses so i will be filming on the red carpet Music candace how are you feeling i have a plan lipstick on your teeth lipstick on teeth Music Music where did you go i could not you like the movie Applause okay theres one clip that i could not figure out where to fit in this story but its a clip my brother van sent me i called him i was like send me whatever footage you have from 2008 can and to set up this clip josh safety who directed the movie that was in the film festival that i executive produced 14 years ago is introducing van and i my brother and me hes introducing us to like the director of this part of the film festival and i dont know why but like this clip maybe more than any of this other nostalgic archival stuff this clip was just like i it just like brought me back to being that 20 something guy who like all i wanted was to figure this world of like storytelling and filmmaking out ready then nice that hes the guy in the end of the movie i just so remember being that guy okay oh there was another scene too where candace flushed her gold bracelet down the toilet after the movie premiere at like three in the morning and we had to have security take apart the entire toilet but we never found the bracelet i didnt put that in the video either but maybe Music its just so me,92.57668711656441,photographers,0.0,1.0,oED9tZyI-vU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oED9tZyI-vU

i miss being a YouTuber,2022-04-18T19:18:22Z,11.433333333333334,2296547,144569,when you turn the camera like this thats called a pan and when you turn the camera quick like this its a swish pan and in the swish part of that pan you can hide the cut swish swish swish and now through a series of swishes im going to travel about 15 000 miles around the world ending here in dubai Music so anyway this is where the adventure begins im on a plane kids there gotta take the family to uh to cape town south africa first before i head to dubai in london heathrow airport for a quick layover look babies do you see it georgie its a big one next stop cape town and yeah so were in cape town gotta drop the family off now and then come back to the airport this is the hotel where im leaving candace and the kids while i go to dubai bye you gonna make the flight no all right so just to recap i started in la then we flew to london then we came to cape town i left the family here now dan and i are on our way to dubai because thats where the story takes place this really is the best airline seat in the world Music we can try sofia im im not even theres no waves here im i promise you we can find waves not in a wave pool serving surfing actual waves good old fashioned casey dan vlog in dubai trying to find waves really i swear to god Music Music dan i just want to say how nice it is to be making videos with you again it does feel good it does feel good okay we have not we have not had any luck coming now to a surf shop to find out if they know where we could surf you live here yeah where can we go surfing right now right in front of there like proper surfing do you have boards here like is this the surf report man for here um yeah what are the waves like right now the waves are actually pumping but its a bit messy uh it is a wind swell so its kind of weird did we do it i told you yeah okay but you can walk here and then just turn left and then turn right and then you can see the beach already Music like the gold remember what the intent was notice to catch waves i know but now youre getting more technical but theres real waves ish you also got a toy now you want a foot nice to meet you thank you well be back what did i tell you come on i might have to blur it out in the footage all right were really doing it this is surfing in dubai take my glasses damn it liam pretty heavy out there in dubai today Music theres actual waves look at this thing Music come on come on where was my best work like it was such a good one dan liam liam missed the shot liam i scrubbed every one of these he didnt get the shot buddy dan its not my fault leah missed the shot liam cinematography is great in general but you did miss the shot buddy Music was it really that fun dude we got me please do it okay so remember that building i was standing in front of in the beginning of this video this place this is dubais museum of the future and this is the reason why dan and i are in dubai yeah come on why are you limping i told you see they invited us to dubai to come see the museum of the future and make a video about it thats why were both there and dan and i agreed but we had one condition we asked that we see the museum at night when no one else was in there are you here to let us in yeah im casey whats your name my name is nice to meet you oh look at that i mean you just and were in Music dan made a special request that we wanted to come at night so are we missing all the good    look at all that in any event were here without any were just kind of theyre very generous with the permission that they gave us to explore this place Music so this space here is like the very top of the eye like of the of the shape of the building but i think its an exhibition space or something because theres nothing up here what are you guys doing yeah just getting some footage of you Music like what this whole video is is i was invited to come to dubai to come see the museum of the future and i was like okay great whats the cat and they said the catch is just that we would love for you to make a youtube video about the museum and that is like one of the absurdities of being like a a prominent youtuber but i want you to know that the that absurdity is not at all lost on me is this insane i lost you bro you have no idea the room i just found what is it dude its like a carpet that moves Music oh my god oh my god Music well i guess that concludes my night at the museum its like midnight now and ive got a plane to catch my review of the dubai museum of the future is this its like a childrens science museum but about the future for adults highly interactive i kind of wish i had my kids here with me but if youre in dubai its definitely worth checking out especially that pink room with the things that you can touch and very special museum and the building itself is its something you got to see with your human eyes its kind of unbelievable Music well it is uh 12 58 its almost 1am and im about to fly back to cape town to see the wife and kiddos you know its been like three years since i left new york and really stopped making regular youtube videos and theres covid and ive been working for three years on this documentary that im excited to share with you and i think i forgot how much i love just making little youtube videos like this and embracing the opportunities that i get because i have this channel and i make these videos and i get to see like dan my friend who lives on the other side of the world because of these videos it is a it is the pleasure and it is the privilege of a lifetime anyway museum of the future thanks for having me candace ill see you soon dan its been great Music focus dude that was proper

HIDDEN VIDEO CAMERA in my Custom Glasses,2021-12-10T21:51:01Z,9.883333333333333,2518156,110365,so apparently Music what is going on here oh Music the door Cams a GoPro hero4 this things probably been on Non Stop for like six years seven years I think I finally killed it come on it still works Music Music thats better so apparently Ray Ban launched a pair of sunglasses that have a built in camera now Ive been known from time to time to wear sunglasses and I also sometimes use a video camera so this seems like maybe an appropriate product for me got me quieter since Ive been gone Music okay can I have a can I have a pair of these but we dont have this style in store Music okay they didnt have them there but I got a phone call while I was in there from a different Sunglass Hut which is crazy because um I didnt give them my phone number whatever Im going downtown gonna get them now take a quick picture gonna be back in the city Music I hope they have them Music Irving Im just our manager here Irving thank you so much any time Irving Ive got a question yes how did you get my phone number well I have a caller ID and I have a list of the people that Im call asking for them you called here earlier and then okay I remember you thank you thank you so much youre the best take care yeah of course of course of course oh thank you so much not yet not yet all right I missed this city though we miss you too oh my God dude can I get a picture yeah totally yeah youre on my vlog Music well that was an adventure wasnt it Music foreign I see one one thing wrong with these Music foreign Music I mean I think they look pretty good on me its the lens right there okay to start a recording I push I push this button right here okay its its recording uh okay this next sequence was shot entirely on my sunglasses and those are sunglasses lets go I gotta go Music were gonna miss our flight are you crying foreign yes thank you sir you guys have a great happy weekend thank you so much thank you Music goodbye now Music hi Freddy hello my baby come on lets go inside bye George you have fun at ballet now every shot you just saw was captured on these glasses every image and well the footage kind of sucks like that whole travel sequence that I wanted that to be like its own little video but the fridge was so unwatchable I cut it down um now In fairness In fairness I did crop the image this is what it looks like at Full Resolution its a square for like Instagram and I cropped it to look like this because these bars here are ugly the image quality should be at least as good as an iPhone 5 like this is like whatever say your old technology it should have been this good it is nowhere near this good these are my Google Glass from 2012 nine years ago and this is what that footage looks like its no way to look cool when you wear these theyre a little bit like the Segway and then my friend Sam Sheffer told me to check out these like Snapchat video glasses now I know this isnt really my style but look at these things ready first of all the image clear as day this image but when Im like running around and Im moving like crazy its Horizon leveling because its a spherical image Snapchat look how good that is Facebook how can Snapchat kick your ass like this whatever I would recommend buying these yet theyre not really useful because the image is so bad and I hope maybe in the version twos you get it right because Id love a video camera that looks like these glasses okay thanks for watching nice to be back on YouTube well see you soon wait wait wait wait wait dont click away dont get away um so if you saw my last video the one I uploaded earlier this week I announced that Im doing this like film school Im doing this online class where I teach you how I make

The Most Important Movie I've Ever Made,2021-12-06T20:07:10Z,9.933333333333334,2244436,126886,Applause Music my most important video ever is this is this really my most important video well first of all it says it is on my hand and yeah this is the most important video because this is this is me this is this is something ive wanted to do for 20 years ive wanted to make i wanted to what this i need a prop this is my high school yearbook freshman year and right here this is me wearing a dress thats me normal like thats what i look like thats my friend kyle but thats me and my sisters dress why am i showing you my high school yearbook why is this video such a big deal why have i not been on youtube for seven months theyre all connected so ive spent like its really been like the last year but intensely for like the last six months making a curriculum for like the casey neistat film school i want to take everything that ive learned in the world of filmmaking and and how i tell stories and self expression and i wanted to put that into like a proper curriculum so i can teach and share my process and understanding and everything else so theres a lot more to it Music see ive always had a rather challenging relationship with education in fact uh freshman year here freshman year was the last full year of high school or any school that i actually finished now i was a bad student for a lot of reasons most of them were my fault entirely i just remember being so disinterested in school like i just didnt care about what they were trying to teach me Music i was like 15 and i didnt understand why i was being taught what i was being taught it just didnt none of it clicked Music that changed that changed when when i discovered filmmakers filmmaking being my passion meant learning it was something that i wanted to do it was me choosing to like educate myself about something i really cared about and that was like a moment that was a trigger for me in life and that was like that was the moment i fell in love with filmmaking yes but i fell in love with learning youre making a movie for nyu yeah well yeah so you guys are in film school at nyu yeah yeah fish and like what are you learning at film school you know thats a good question all right so this video that im making right here is about like im launching my own like film school no way the case is nice its like the casey neistat film school um im warning filmmaking right now im in documentary im an advanced documentary im putting together my own like casey film school really yeah wow okay do you have any advice for me but i feel like the experience of collaborating with other filmmakers is extremely valuable so thats what im here for collaborating meeting like minded people that makes a big difference yeah nice to meet you good luck with your class thank you take care now look i have nothing against nyu this is nyu here i mean spike lee went to nyu martins where stazey went to nyu adam sandler went to nyu its a great institution but it costs 54 880 a year times four education has changed just like filmmaking has changed and maybe you dont want to be the next martin scorsese maybe you just want to know how to express yourself by making movies or maybe you just want to share something and videos are the best way to do that i think back to when i was like 17 i first discovered what it meant to like make videos i would have killed for a crash course from like michelle gondry or spike jones or any of these guys that i looked up to when i was a aspiring filmmaker i would have loved some way to access their thought process with that like that aspiration that i had when i was younger that i kind of designed this and designed this curriculum in the sirens nothing changes in new york city there are always sirens interrupting me first rule of filmmaking sound proof studio yeah all right josh youre a super successful filmmaker when i got exposed to their movies and i saw what they they have done and how amazing their stuff is and the fact that they wanted to work with me that was exciting but back in the day you and i made movies together so i guess my question for you what would you tell people that they might have to learn about filmmaking from me i mean im thinking i mean this is the truth for me i i i what i what i learned from you is something you learn from you know jumping off a cliff you you dont know what it feels like until you jump right thats what my first lessons is about is that true yes just committing so uh what is it whats the class i worked with a company called monthly and together we spent uh several weeks here in this studio shooting like the classes okay this is it this is were starting shooting for the first time all right guys im ready im ready to teach they did they like soundproofed this whole room wow okay lets go day one take one it was very strange having like a professional video team here filming me but they were great it was really it looks good like it doesnt look like one of my silly youtube videos it looks great theres never been a lighting kit like this in my studio before and then its me teaching you like how i make films while i make a movie so its its a really like its a dynamic course but its just about how i do things so its not technical if you want to learn how to use your camera just google it or whatever its not about how to get a lot of views on youtube ask mr beast if thats your goal its its much more about how i see filmmaking as sort of the ultimate tool for self expression what is this place were in the screening room at jerry bruckheimer films why are you tell me what a big deal you are why are you at jerry brockheimer films uh well its a pretty big deal henry and i just directed a film for produced by jerry brockheimer rel here is a very very very big deal but long before he was a big deal he and i used to work together on movies and im im wondering like if you could share do you have any anecdote do you have you im trying to convince them to you were my first jerry bruckheimer theres i think theres a lot of ways to make a movie and casey neistat taught me the most self sufficient way i went to film school for years i spent thousands and thousands of dollars on it and dont tell nyu but i think i might have learned more in four weeks working for casey neistat than two years at film school okay when does your movie come out well in theaters uh summer next summer 2022 secret headquarters its called secret headquarters its called secret headquarters right now were in the secret headquarter finishing the movie thatll come out next summer im usually like a pretty confident guy but im genuinely nervous about this um the reason why ive never tried to share my process like share my how i make movies before is because i wanted to get it right thats why this is like the most important its faded the most important video ive made is because this is the first time im bringing this to the universe im sharing this with you if youve watched this video this long maybe youre interested in it if you are theres a link below you should sign up you should do it its 300 bucks its a month long its not like a full time thing its just like you do it at your leisure its not like a heavy lift its like a fun thing and then i hope to get your feedback like i hope im nervous about this all right heres like a little thing that edited from the actual class this is what it looks like hi im casey neistat and welcome to my monthly class Music this class is a hands on 30 day learning experience designed to teach you everything that i know about filmmaking and storytelling

shoes could change how i can change a life and it has definitely changed my life because of that all i need is a pair of shoes to go running and i realized this point in this world even in the united states we have kids around that have no shoes to wear we should throw some love to jim shark who kind of shout out to jim shark honestly theres no way i could have afford this or get it done because because of them i had a mobile home check this out what am i hearing whats happening right now we are sliding out the side of the of this thing and it makes it humongous i just want to say that your definition of humongous hella is very generous so its a little bit messy how many how long have you been sleeping in here 83 days and i get less than five hours of sleep every day since i started whenever you end your run you gotta pull us on the side of the road and sleep and get up and repeat so thank you gymshark what do you want people to take from this from this um i want people to take that were much stronger than we think and not be scared to go tackle something thats huge and im actually proud to say i am the first black person to run across the country later in new york city and i think thats a good thing to say to let anybody know it doesnt matter who youre what you do get up and chase your dreams and goals dont let anything label you you can just make it happen so thats what i want people to get out of this much love to jim shark for sponsoring and making this whole thing possible i mean really what an inspiration that guy is running across the country lets run so Music hello this is the beginning of the beginning around 20 miles we got coming going into new york city Music what is it what is it about running theres something about it that makes you feel invincible in the moment when youre enduring pain and you just feel like you can go through it and then when you finish thats the best feeling so no matter what it is you find a way to finish because the feeling after theres nothing like it youve run for 84 straight days 40 miles a day yes what are you gonna do tomorrow morning when you wake up when youre done with all this im gonna go run with casey neistat were gonna go run some more its not ready its not gonna be 40 miles but were gonna go for it im gonna go for a couple miles youre gonna do more but you get up and get after it again thats what you gotta do this is it youre entering new york Music Music ellie youre like four miles away from crossing the entire country any thoughts this feels this was the easiest day because having this amazing crowd having you here having like no i didnt know that id be running all 20 miles with you today i didnt know that was the plan i feel great i feel great so now you got to let people know

my brother Van,2021-03-09T22:30:43Z,11.85,2968019,117582,there he is theres my brother van Music so lets run it up a pole and see who salutes you like that carl that was my great uncle louie nye he was like a comedian in the 60s very successful changed his name from nystat to 9 just because it was easier to to pronounce youd probably id never heard of my uncle louis nye but todays video is about another nice that maybe you dont know enough about and that is my brother van neistadt Music Music let me start with a little bio so 42 years ago my mom was a single mom working as a waitress in a restaurant and she had a little baby boy named van my dad went into that restaurant met my mom started dating her met van really liked van then my mom married my dad and my dad so my dad married my mom and then my dad barry nystat nice that then adopted there then my sister was born and i was born and my little brother was born and we had this childhood that wasnt a bad childhood it was just a childhood it was a good childhood then van went to college like whatever 12 years later and he went to college in virginia which is far away from where we lived in connecticut and i ran away from home when i was 15 and i ran away from home to van in virginia but for me to go to high school in virginia i needed to have like a guardian a parent so it was at that point in time so at that point in time van adopted a nice dad me full circle van was my legal guardian okay then i moved back to connecticut i had a kid van move to new york city i went to visit van the summer of 2000 and he showed me his computer its the first time i ever edited a video and that first time i ever edited a video was because van sat me down in front of my computer and showed me how to do it so i moved to new york city to become a filmmaker because of van because he had inspired that in me and when i moved there he and i became like this filmmaking duo there was no casey neistat it was just the neistat brothers every movie we made we made together like ipod dirty secret the first video ever that got us any attention Music it was vans idea and he was the one holding the camera spicy this video from like a 2002 maybe were running around new york city stealing our own bikes to show that the cops didnt give a    about stolen bikes and snap that one was also vans idea youve never seen this is a video about sneaking into scholastics publishing headquarters to get really cheap lunch at their cafeteria weve been doing this for about three years we only got in trouble once that was vans fault it wasnt a bad video but this was my idea not vans idea okay i was like looking for a video to show you what like a quintessential nystat brothers video was this video right here were in paris for like work and we were supposed to shoot a video that day and we couldnt theres this huge protest taking place so we got these like french punk rock kids we put ski masks on we made a big poster that said viva la neistat brothers la vie de nice that i dont speak french and we tried to make the protest look like it was like a nice that brothers celebratory protest Music anyhow those were the kinds of videos we used to make at like the like the earliest days of our career and all of the early videos from my career had one thing in common which is that i made them all with van wait what are you doing wait dont dont take off your pants yet serious question and dont pull any punches whos the most talented nice step brother van why wouldnt you say okay did you want me to say you Music so we took our little partnership the nightstand brothers all all the way from like making silly videos online to having our own show on hbo Music remember uncle louie who had to change his last name so people would know how to pronounce it this is one of my favorite segments from our hbo show that van made about how to pronounce our our name its pronounced neistat nice like rice or ice or mice Music heres a little anecdote to help you remember about seven years ago casey and i went to vegas and got drunk for a week and casey got a tattoo everywhere we went he loved to show off his nice tat nice dad the hbo show was awesome it was basically a youtube vlog on hbo 10 years before anybody knew what a youtube vlog was but hbo didnt think it was that awesome and they didnt renew us for a second season so after that van left new york city moved to la and the neistat brothers were no longer i was just casey neistat in new york and he was van neistat in la now van did a lot of things in la he worked on his art career he made other movies he made sculptures he made paintings this is not a van neistat painting this is van gogh vincent van gogh Music but one thing van never did one thing van has never done is start a youtube channel Music this house is where my brother van lives and this this gate here is a very good explanation of uh the kind of guy van is this gate is unique one of a kind built by hand built by van for one purpose to protect x x is vans little boy from the stairs love dad june 23rd 2019 Music you see there are a billion channels on youtube but no channel like vans channel unlike me and most everyone else in the world vans brain has not been poisoned by social media because he hes never really used social media and his videos are unlike any other creators because the guy doesnt watch youtube Music van studio when people would come to my office in new york city they would like look around like it was a museum or something that never really made sense to me until i stepped foot in here is that a homemade gimbal us property night vision Music yeah van is a fascinating guy but because hes not a youtuber because he doesnt know the youtube world his videos theyre not motivated by likes or views or subscribers its just pure untouched creativity and thats why hes my favorite youtuber hes the only youtuber i turn the little alarm on for and he might just accidentally be the best youtuber of all times did you mention my youtube channel i did i did mention your youtube channel okay thanks Music this

Who I'm Voting For 2020,2020-10-27T15:56:56Z,6.483333333333333,2220548,114477,its a great its a great hat great hat I guess I should start this video by saying Joe Biden I will be voting for Joe Biden um I really was not looking forward to making this video and not because Im afraid of the comments or the awful things that my detractors are going to say about me for making this video but I didnt want to make this video cuz Ive never ever felt so disenfranchised with us politics its you know its every time I turn on the news or I read news online or I look at Twitter or anything in between it just feels like this overwhelming noise from the world of of politics and I think that it just be has become so overwhelming Id always rather just like play with my kids or or go make a video about a drone or go surfing or play Call of Duty or anything that is not engaging with politics and Im not proud of that Im Im ashamed of that I think that you know like the the government and the politicians who lead the government they have a big impact on my life on all of our daily lives and um I think whether you choose to participate or you stick your head in the sand either way youre a part of it so why not inform yourself as best you can and then try to engage in difficult conversations not all the time but sometimes and then also just no matter how funny you think that this hat is dont wear it because its not productive even though its hysterical uh so with that I you know Im Im trying and I Ive made some political donations this year I mean not to either presidential campaign um but to smaller campaigns where I thought it could have an impact most of my most donations that I make are not political most are for places like food banks and um lgbtq plus causes things like that thats where I like to you know if Im giving money away thats what I like to focus my energy on but um but what Im really trying to do now in a way Ive never done before is to really listen and interact and engage with peoples who uh people who have political opinions that that really differ from my own um and its not because I want to have my mind changed but its because I want to maybe better understand I think that theres theres always been divisiveness in this country and around the world and anytime theres humans there are theres divisiveness but I never remember it being as Extreme as it is right now its something that like Im aware of and I feel every single day whether I leave the house or not um I support this guy I support this party or this position and if you dont youre wrong and I hate you and Im going to say awful things about you on Twitter and Im going to show up at protests and Im going to scream in your face and sometimes it leads to violence I see this stuff like every day um and I you know I I do have beliefs and I think some of my beliefs are are flexible some things I dont understand and Im always open to engaging in conversations about those and if somebody can make more sense than I can make sense of something then thats great it it informs my perspective and there are other positions that I hold that are completely inflexible things that Im Im are at the core of who I am and Ive always felt that way and if you dont feel that way I might think youre wrong but I dont hate you and I I dont wish harm upon you I think like my dad voted for Donald Trump I disagree with him and its definitely led to some very uncomfortable conversations for the last couple years at Thanksgiving but hes still my dad I still love the guy you know I I think whether Trump wins or doesnt win and by the way Im recording this video like one week out from the election and I think Donald Trump has a very very good chance of winning this election um I dont really their polls I I think that Donald Trump has a very good chance of winning this election but regardless of whether or not he wins um I dont think that this divisiveness is going to is is going to go away anytime soon and that really like that scares me its tremendous concern to be like raising kids in a place or living existing in a world in a country where theres such um such divisiveness and I also struggle because I dont know what the best way to address that divisive is um Im voting against Donald Trump because I I think that he more than any other president that I can remember is doing more to further divisiveness but Im also trying personally hard to engage and listen to others even when we dont see eye to eye you know if your political beliefs differ from mine youre not my enemy and those things feel like they can contradict but thats something that Im actively Im actively working on so I think thats it and Im sure if you look at the comments theres going to be a lot of people calling me names because Im not supporting trumps and therell be a lot of people calling me names or mad at me because Im not doing a good enough job supporting Biden Im not going to take it personally um I just wanted to make this video because I wanted you to know how I feel and I cant wear this hat which is how I really feel because its too confusing um but thats thats kind of it Ill end this diet tribe with a quote that I read on Twitter from the great ice tea where he said at some point youll realize what they think doesnt matter enjoy your life no matter what okay all right thats it thats all I wanted to say Ill see you in 2024,164.11311053984576,disenfranchised,0.0,1.0,qaanivZHttE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaanivZHttE
the SURPRISE of her life!!!,2020-10-26T18:24:34Z,6.883333333333334,1569605,64281,how old are you i cant remember come on people can google it how old are you candace paul this is it this is the moment were going to give her her birthday presents you know what let me just rewind 24 hours two things i need to do number one is get candace a birthday present tomorrows our birthday number two is ive got to do this like brand deal for nordvpn Music so heres what im thinking nord vpns always been cool with my ideas in the past no matter how crazy they are so why not just blow the whole like brand deal budget on candaces birthday present Music so the present is twofold it begins with uh some jewelry which is what im buying right now and then the second part is thats a little bit more complicated Music okay i got the jewelry Music so okay last thing i had to pick up the cake look it says happy birthday candace and the lady kind of screwed it up but it was eight dollars and its a nice cake and nobodys gonna mind and then the second part of her present and this is like the real present present is a trip to this spa that shes wanting to go to for like a couple years now shes wanting to go to this place i booked it like in two weeks and i got my mother in law to watch the kids everything set up i even figured out travel to get to the spa because its a trip i uh im just um printing out like the itinerary Music she never comes down to the basement this is the big moment were gonna give her her presents happy birthday mommy oh thank you my baby i forgot to take the price tag off it cost eight dollars so pretty thank you that wasnt your main present this is your main present candace i was like what you know what do you mind just actually just turning that upside down there you go Applause there we go perfect okay so this is an ad for one of my longest best sponsors ive ever had on this channel uh nordvpn okay you know like when youre looking at whatever a website any website and theres like ads along the sides that are like meet singles in your area or like look at this restaurant and it like says the name of your town or anything and like it like knows where you live those ads know where you live because your ip address is public in any website that you visit knows your ip address and where youre coming from its like having a revealing caller id but for every website you ever go to thats some of the information youre giving up by having your ip address be public a vpn like nordvpn it masks it hides your ip address and you can make your ip address from anywhere in the world so like okay i open up my computer this is what nord looks like here i can like click quick connect right here and itll just randomly click a place or i can tell it to pretend im in any of these countries im in france oh look at that now im connected to france and thats where everybody thinks im from its 2020 you should be using a vpn everyone should uh nords a very good vpn beyond just being a sponsor of my channel they get theyre very highly regarded in the industry and right now you get 68 off of a two year plan if you go to nordvpncom casey and thats like 371 cents a month so if you are going to use a vpn which you should 371 is cheap nords cool because they sponsor my channel and whatever ive been using for three years and its like not problematic i use it on my iphone my android phone my apple my mac laptop and it works on windows too i just dont i dont have windows okay thank you nord for being such a great sponsor is it good georgie okay how old are you how old are you candace paul 43 does that feel weird yes whats it like to be old i think before 30 i wished i was 20 and now that im 40 im scared of the future instead of like missing the past and my youth now im like oh my god do you think youre a different person from who you were when you were really young yeah but i dont know if thats because of drugs and therapy because im just getting older who were you when you were young candace stupid just stupid wait where are you going im returning the bracelet you got me Music you,118.83777239709443,complicated,0.0,1.0,TXLUafBNjnc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXLUafBNjnc
it's time to say NO!,2020-10-15T21:18:41Z,5.333333333333333,1520504,66415,add blue eyeshadow and pink lipstick and who did mommys makeup give me a slow blink why are you laughing me i think it looks dont take it thank you how are you gonna eat that Music foreign Applause come on ive never made it up those steps before so im on tick tock and theres like this entrepreneur like motivational speaker like guy and hes like hes hes doing his schtick and what he talked about hit home so hard for me im going to try and paraphrase them having the power in life to say no when people ask for your time basically its like when someone asks you to do something that you dont have to do like you have to work you have to spend time you dont have to do but they want you to do it but you dont want to do it its okay to say no because when you say yes its an hour and then if you say yes a couple times a week its several hours and then that adds up and that adds up and it accumulates and theres a price to pay for that cumulative like giving away your time Music as a person who lives with a wife and a baby how do you possibly get a free time like where do you find time for yourself how do you not go crazy well i go surfing with you and uh no i mean yeah ive constantly interrupted it its its so annoying because at the end of the day you know you get in a zone you need to have a flow whether its creative whether youre writing something are you talking to someone its a train of thought or a certain flow and its interrupted and youre like okay now you have to get back into that space right right Music yes its its just funny that you are asking me this question because you are the one youre the biggest time suck on my life but okay its like your life is a duffel bag right but its its a tight devil its like a hard shell duffel bag its not like an expanding duffel bag right so you can only put so many things in there before its totally packed full and of course theres certain things that take priority right like your family whatever they need that they get you know your extended family but then theres like kind of the friends and acquaintance section of your life and this is the part that can really expand or contract the point is if you want to be a really good friend you dont have to say yes to everything your friends ask of you you just need to be there when it matters wait thats a perfect say that again if you want to be a really good friend to someone you dont have to do everything they ask you to do you just need to be there when it matters yes so a motivational speaker on tick tock and like the advice of um friends that i trust and i really appreciate but i i still struggle to find a balance between like my external responsibilities like like paying bills and work and family and stuff and then the internal like making time for yourself and doing it in a way where you dont feel guilty about it i know the value i know the importance of this but finding that balance i think is one of the things thats been extremely difficult for me as as ive gotten older last night candace dressed up like ghost drank some vodka and walked around the neighborhood scaring people wheres my cocktail Music you,118.3125,responsibilities,0.0,1.0,4NBI6nrGI1w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NBI6nrGI1w
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DRONE! it won't stop following me,2020-10-13T21:23:37Z,9.433333333333334,1693096,65279,okay this is a tech review video and im gonna go for a run ready watch the drone no control Music ah Music this uh this is the skydio2 drone now this is a super compelling drone for a lot of reasons but i think maybe the number one reason is that it is not made by dji dji completely dominates the drone averse basically if you own a drone and its worth a damn its made by dji the only drone that i use in this entire channel and every video all those how do you get that shot shots rashad and dji its a great product but just like tick tock there are some geopolitical concerns with dji the chinese company not my concerns the us governments concerns Music see what that says right there assembled in the usa and this well this isnt a political video or anything like that the politics of drones in the united states is a very interesting part of the story and its skydio the company that makes this blue plastic drone that has a big contract with the us military to make little flying military drones for them i found all that fascinating but lets talk about this device Applause firstly at 999 the price is wildly compelling especially because it has a 4k 60 chip on it or whatever it can record at 4k 60 the lens is actually very good the lens is threaded so you can put nd filters on it and it feels like this time around skydio really put a lot of effort into making sure this could take a picture that at minimum could compete with with djis offering and i think it does Music and while the arms on this thing dont fold the way the arms fold on a dji the the propellers they fold so you can cram this in a backpack in the same way that you could break down your dji into a backpack the case that i use for the skydio with an extra battery is about the same size as the case that i use for the controller and extra battery for the dji and even though this thing is this cute blue color i did wear a shirt to match it on purpose um it doesnt feel like a toy this feels like a sort of like a robust kind of tool the same way the dji does or any like camera does i must admit at first i was nervous about the way the skydios battery attaches to the the camera the drone itself but it it works really well and im confident now ready magnets Music now getting into like drone ideology or filmmaking ideology like how you think of a device like this fitting into like your wheelhouse of cameras for me it goes like this i dont think of a drone as a drone as in like an artificially intelligent flying person that can take pictures of me for me its a its a flying camera so ill fly it to location ill put it there and ill get my shot ill fly it to a location ill sort of set marks and ill control it manually to get the shot that i want just like any other camera in my arsenal im in control and im trying to get a specific image yes its got technology to think for itself and to avoid objects and to keep it stable and to lock to gps but all that stuff is invisible to me i feel like im in control im getting my picture and quite frankly thats what it feels like this thing was designed to do now thats also where skydio it feels like is really differentiating itself well this thing can sort of do that theres like a controller i have it for extra money you can attach this kind of janky bulky plastic playstation controller looking thing thats supposed to offer precision controls but i didnt really like its precision or lack thereof this thing is a drone in the most terminator sense of the word drone this is that terminator like ai i was talking about no hands Music so Music so Music Applause Music ah Music i hate like a cobweb during that little run around there one area where you can see that skydio is very much so a young company is in like the user interface on their app like the the controller for the actual drone dji feels very mature like polished good its everything you want it to be and skydios sort of feels like djis did a couple years ago like it its a little rough around the edges when skydio is doing what skydio does best which is like be a flying terminator camera it is the best but when you want to use it like a camera the way i use my other drone thats where its uh thats where its uh it still has a lot of room to grow Music Applause my rule with drone cinematography is that if it looks like it was captured by a drone i dont use this shot i want it to look like it was on a crane i wanted to look like it was a helicopter i wanted to look like i climbed above a building and stuck a 50 foot tripod out and thats how i got the shot i dont like cinematography that looks robotic or unnatural and that in essence is what the super power or the killer app of the skydio 2 is is that it is a robot that can capture for you and do it in a way that i dont think anything else in the market can even compete with so if something like action sports is your priority or youre new to drone cinematography and you lack confidence in your ability to operate a flying camera i think this might be the perfect drone for you but to anyone more advanced than that or anybody whos familiar with how to actually operate a drone in a like a manual capacity uh it still feels like skydio has a lot of catching up to do in that department also im like filming this in my backyard right now um because when i was shooting it in the woods i dropped my camera and and broke it for the dji this lens costs three thousand dollars

1 serious question about the GoPro Hero9,2020-09-16T14:00:19Z,6.95,2811406,116192,foreign i dont know Music um Music this is a this is a tech review Music in todays tech review well be looking at the latest and greatest offering from gopro so every year when gopro announces their new camera their latest offering i asked myself one question which is why why gopro should i spend 450 bucks on another gopro when i have my old gopro that still works because these things never die and now i have a cell phone that has a super wide angle lens on it its sort of kind of waterproof and it takes like an okay enough video image and that that existential question is kind of all i care about and all im going to focus on in this review Applause this is a six thousand dollar camera rig this is the new 450 dollar gopro hero9 6000 450 the front facing screen gopro its about time the the girth is bigger definitely like taller and fatter and wider and its heavier theres this like fetish with especially like cell phones and and small cameras as well to get them as small as possible in fact remember when gopro launched that this like tiny gopro called the gopro session and it was so small in the commercial for it a guy had it in his mouth and you could see out of his mouth while the dentist was like working on his teeth but you had to sacrifice everything like the the battery didnt last long didnt have any buttons on it theres no interface i dont need to film myself at the dentist this new gopro which is bigger i can still attach to a helicopter blade i can still put on my surfboard i can still attach my bike or my truck or whatever i want to do its small enough but what you get in return for that increase in size which is negligible is you get like a much bigger battery you get a proper proper front facing screen that lets you frame your shots and it makes it easier for vlogging and when you attach it to something you can actually see what youre shooting its like small enough is totally good enough i dont need them to be tiny and about gopros biggest competitors they make a good product but after using the nine for like a week and a half you realize gopros learned a lot in nine generations of making this camera um and thats particularly embodied in in this new device so when uh tech companies launch a new product they typically have like launch events last years for example gopros launch event was at a water park its like you could test out the product and stuff but it was also like a fun day at a water park but were in the midst of a global pandemic so like cant have any fun events so what do they do Music the gopro dune buggy come on now the assumption here is that the uh remote control car is to test out the image stabilization on this camera but i think you know gopros smart and i think they know that tech reviewers like me were just all big nerds and were total suckers for remote control dune buggies nice one gopro Music all right so uh trying to pay attention how good the stabilization is im not doing any any stabilizing in post here everything you see is in camera Applause Music okay oh Applause i put so much effort into my videos and the cinematography and all that and you do like five million views a video its just you sitting and talking to camera do you even even own a gopro what is that thing stand up so did they do it in a world where theres like a lot of good enough options do you need the best if this wide angle lens video camera on my cell phone is a cheeseburger do you need the steak if the old uh honda civic works uh works well enough to get you tuned from where you need to go do you need a lambo yes gopro made the best camera theyve ever made i didnt get into the fact that it has interchangeable lenses its incredible its its perfect in every way but whether or not you need to shell out the 450 bucks to get it is entirely up to whether or not theres a marketplace for excellent when the world is saturated with with good enough Music thats a remote controlled car you want to play with it Music you,112.66187050359711,interchangeable,0.0,1.0,nk0aCRuU2qw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk0aCRuU2qw

JAMIE FOXX GAVE ME A BLACK EYE,2020-08-14T15:13:54Z,10.816666666666666,2039425,100726,see that look at the size of that well right there look at that its its not clickbait this is the totally true story of how jamie foxx the movie star hit me in the face and gave me like a give me a black eye i am a terrible actor get back to set now so ive talked before about my friends ariel shulman and henry juiced these are like friends of mine when i was young and we used to make like stupid fun videos together were still super close but when i went like the degenerate route of being like a youtuber they went like the pro filmmaker root and now theyre like big wig hollywood filmmakers Music now i know this is a big deal movie like a huge huge hollywood movie beyond jamie foxx joseph gordon levitts in it and dominique fishbacker in it huge movie stars but when you show up on set and you see what like a movie of this caliber looks like its incredibly intimidating a little bit of context here the movie is called project power and the premise of the movie is that like you can take this one pill and it gives you like a superhero power but you dont know what that power is going to be like maybe it makes you like incredibly strong or bulletproof or turns you into like a fire person or makes you invisible or makes it so you can climb up buildings or it could be anything like turns you into a superhero but only for five minutes and also it could kill you thats the premise of the movie great movie its out on netflix you should check it out but that thats the context of this situation Music you know what it means to be um to be type cast typecasting is when like you assign a movie role to an actor who in real life is like that character like if your character in the movie is like a really handsome charming funny guy you hire channing tatum thats typecasting so in this movie my character the role that i play is that of a total douchebag who rides a motorcycle type cast Music and in my opening scene i roll up with like my movie girlfriend who is like this total babe whos is not my wife that took some getting used to and her name is jazzy and i have to like drive up on my motorcycle and get off my motorcycle and spoiler alert not really im in the movie for like 30 seconds and i like get off my motorcycle im like this tough guy and like bump into jamie foxx in action this sounds easy and probably because it is for any normal actor but i screwed it up and we had to do the take like 10 times and one of those times i turned to jamie and i was like hey how do you think i did that time and he was like hes like i dont know man im not the director i asked those guys and he pointed at henry and rail and i was like cool Music thats a true story like what i felt like such an idiot because like to see jamie foxx in real life i i am the biggest fan of this guy but this is his world like he is this actor and he takes what he does so seriously and hes so good on set and hes such a good like hes just such a good performer and on top of that hes like just strikingly handsome in real life and like this is our first scene together and im just like screwing it up left and right but then the big scene happens Music we enter this underground like nightclub bar and this was in like a set like in a huge sound stage they built this whole set and theres like 20 stunt guys in there and this huge battle is supposed to go down in there okay so in this set this is the stunt squad here these guys theyre really good fighters so on the set here theyre about to shoot a big action sequence with lots of explosions and i kept getting in trouble because i kept playing with the prop guns and they were just props but they were all really cool but like the prop master is in charge of the guns he doesnt want people touching them theres a pattern here in that pattern is that i was not like i was not as professional on set as i should have been this is all a learning experience for me i think like one of the more impressive things that the like the professional actors and actresses on set could do is in between takes they could be having fun like jamie in particular had a backpack that was a boombox and he was playing music between takes everyones having a good time then its work time boom hes a pro again Music this is silly to say but like thats so different from making youtube videos or making non fiction videos where its like youre always kind of capturing the reality but on these sets you have to get into character and you have to own that character Music all right so my big scene and this is a spoiler but im not giving much away because my like my role in this movie has almost no bearing on like the broader plot line but my scene goes like this me and my girlfriend go into this bar and then my girlfriend goes into this like chamber and shes gonna demo the power pill like the pill that gives you the superhero power but things go horribly wrong and i need to get her out of that cell so like shes in there freaking out and i have to like get her and then jamie foxx goes on a tear and starts killing everybody in the room and im one of those guys all right it doesnt look like this in the final movie but you see like okay thats like my girlfriend and theres all kinds of special effects in the real movie where she we gotta see what happens during the movie and then im out there and im like yo ill save you babe let me kick in this class and then out of nowhere comes jamie foxx kicking ass behind me smashes my face into the glass and down i go now i think that that take right there that was actually a rehearsal and the rehearsal i just remember after her so my little brother said to me casey youre not selling it like youre not selling it like i dont believe it so then we tried this thing where they taped like a blood covered sponge to my forehead so when i hit the wall it splattered blood that that didnt work either so then the stunt man steps out and in comes jamie foxx and as like the spinning around is happening all thats going through my head is like full send casey sell it sell you cant just hit the wall of your hand and make the noise you gotta really own that and jamie like grabs the back of my head and boom and i should have stopped it because he wasnt using any force it was all me instead of stopping i went and then like straight look Music straight back onto the ground and i just had to play dead yo yo rao are you nervous about the movie coming out tomorrow yeah a little bit a little bit its so exciting my baby off to school um so im making this youtube video rel and its like its all about how jamie foxx punched me in the face and gave me a black eye on accident he didnt punch you in the head he slammed your face against a plexi glass tank because you asked him to i wanted it to be convincing but im worried that hes gonna be mad when he sees it what hes not gonna be mad hes gonna love it he loved you you dont you dont think that like its gonna remind him of just what like a goof i was on the set you want to call him his number im not calling im not calling baby    just facetime him he loves facetime i guarantee you jamie foxx right now is starring in some huge movie on set or hes out like doing some charity projects saving the worlds children and he doesnt want a facetime call from casey neistat you call him rel can you call him fine all right im in the idaho airport lets facetime jamie foxx and uh see if you remember slamming your face against the glass what are you getting worked doing oh that looks like it feels good hey you dont have to stop man keep going whats going on you remember uh casey neistat who was in the movie you when you banged his he banged his head against the glass remember that guy he thinks that youre mad that you were uh upset no hes great what are you talking about thats what i said it was worth it right yeah oh man oh great like not even not even close like maybe i do have a future in hollywood after all Music you,148.84437596302004,intimidating,1.0,1.0,8yqpfLLG_vQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yqpfLLG_vQ
i don't know what im doing anymore,2020-08-11T20:24:34Z,10.783333333333333,3148897,170946,Applause its 4 47 in the morning and this is the start of a of a 500 mile road trip Applause Music Music air ran over uh ran over a nail instead of fixing it i just kind of left it so the tire leaks air all the time and i gotta constantly refill it Applause no i dont want you to watch more talk all right thank you take care Music now venice where we are right now a very shady town and definitely not the kind of place where you want to be out putting air in your tire at four in the morning there are definitely some unsavory individuals in this neighborhood thats why ive got this flashlight if theres any trouble at least i can see it coming and now the uh the road trip begins in earnest the next stop is uh 187 miles away looks like the suns coming up Music the suns out i still have another hour and 38 minutes until my next uh my next stop Music Music so so this is just a quick like two day road trip from la up to san francisco hes still up there finishing school and because of travel restrictions and whatnot its been kind of hard to see him hes been down to la a couple of times but its a lot for him to drive and we dont like him flying because of corona so you know i dont mind i dont mind an excuse for a road trip not traveling has certainly been one of the hardest aspects of the pandemic for us and i dont just mean traveling for fun i mean like traveling to see family traveling for business things like that its a little thing to complain about but it is something that that i kind of miss so excited for this trip so this is a um this is a sponsored video its not sponsored by tick tock and actually it wasnt going to be a sponsored video but then um donald trump announced yesterday that hes going to ban tick tock or he wants to bend tick tock or something and it made me think of one of the long time sponsors of my channel nordvpn a vpn is a service that uh it hides your internet traffic from your internet service provider it it does a lot of things to protect you online but heres how you would use nordvpn to uh access tiktok should it ever be banned when an app or an internet service is banned in the united states it means you cant access it from a us ip address when you have a nordvpn you can just choose whatever country in the world you want your ip address to be from and then voila access to tick tock now nordvpn does offer a lot of other services um protecting your identity online protecting your web traffic important things like that but also does another really cool thing if you change what country your ip address comes from and then you go to netflix you get all kinds of different content its also true on like disney plus so its a great way to find new and fresh stuff on netflix so if you go to nordvpncom casey or use code casey on nordvpncom you get 70 off a three year plan theyre ending this soon so if you want that 70 off or three year plan which makes the subscription 350 a month dot nordvpncom forward slash casey great way to cheat netflix great way to use tick tock in countries where its banned Music so Music so Music so this is a uh this is um this is a hotel room uh owen invited me to stay at his apartment but as a this apartment is a very small studio so i love the kid but i opted to stay in this hotel room uh instead hey dad junior i have arrived im in san francisco um i was thinking you could drive here and then we could bike and go eat you have two bikes no you would rent one that sounds like a great idea Music its a little bit chillier here than it is in la so just gonna put on a little bit something warmer to wear time to go find the kid Music so ive ive been a dad my like my entire adult life uh like owens mom was pregnant we i was 16 years old when when we got pregnant with owen and okay so the other day im out with georgie and franny my two baby girls and im with a friend who doesnt have any kids and hes like watching me play with the girls and theyre happy and theyre lovey and theyre giggling and theyre being goofy and hes like you know what casey youre a great dad and i snapped at him and i was like you have any idea how easy this is you know how easy it is to be a dad to a little kid or to a baby you got to keep them safe you got to make sure theyre well fed and theyre happy and youre teaching them important values and morals and stuff like that its a piece of cake a little kit piece of cake try being a parent to a 22 year old grown ass man Music i dont know what to do its its really tough as a dad its real the older owen has gotten the harder its been for me to understand what my role is in his life and owen is wonderful he just he graduated college and he is deans list and hes just killing it and im so proud of him and i love him so much but i dont know where i like its i dont know where i fit in Music so with that with owen i try to just be there but its really its tough for me Music whats funny is of this whole trip which has been great wonderful with owen the one time i really felt like a dad was taking him to the grocery store and buying him whatever groceries he wanted Music as a parent im feeding im taking care of my child anybody who says it gets easier as they get older is full of it and uh all right bye buddy bye ill see you tomorrow see you tomorrow that was fun right okay its still great its just i look at him and i miss that little boy where i knew exactly what to do im proud of you owen owen doesnt watch my youtube videos he

What Black Lives Matter Protests are really about,2020-06-04T23:44:03Z,8.533333333333333,2072095,134494,I have not made a video in a while making videos for me as has always been like my escape my passion that thing I love doing but Ive been struggling to find focus lately and I think that that is um I think its true for a lot of people Ive been out protesting every day since they began in the shadow of George Floyds murder and I wanted to explain why Ive been protesting and what it is that Im protesting okay youre asleep in your bed and youre at home and its after midnight and all of a sudden youre sleep in that bed your girlfriends next to you boom door gets kicked in three men smashing your door and they come running into your home and you youre worried about your girlfriend so you grab your gun which youre legally permitted to have and you see these three dudes you shoot up one of them you hit him in the leg and the three guys that just broke into your house that just smashed on your door they respond by firing 20 shots eight of which hit your girlfriend and shes dead and then you get taken away and handcuffs by the three men that just broke into your apartment and killed your girlfriend her name was Brianna Taylor she was 26 years old she worked as a technician in an emergency room and shes dead and the three men that shot her were cops they were in plain clothes they had something called a no knock search warrant which permitted them to bus in that door totally unannounced and all the night and they did all this because they thought that she had drugs in her apartment those cops the police they didnt find any drugs because she didnt she didnt have any drugs her apartment that was March 13 that was three months ago and the three men who shot her eight times and killed her theyve faced no punishment thats not just thats not right and if there are laws that say that thats okay that are protecting these three men who killed her then those laws are wrong and whether its a knee on your neck for nine minutes until you asphyxiate and die because you use the counterfeit 20 bill or youre strangled to death and it chokehold on a sidewalk because you were selling individual cigarettes shes not supposed to do none of thats just none of that is justice no no thats okay and it it if youve got a conscience you you want that to change and change is really hard you vote you speak up you promote politicians or people who can affect change who have the same values as you but sometimes you have to take to the streets sometimes you March you you force your voice to be heard this right now this is a moment and this is a moment that will be discussed and talked about for the rest of our lives and right now that discussion is muddled and its muddled by the looters and criminals who are using peaceful discourse peaceful protesting as an excuse for criminality its muddled by police that are tear gassing demonstrators for a photo shooting stand in front of a boarded up church and its modeled by these sensational instances that make for that make for compelling television but if you look just beyond the    youre seeing on the news every night you look just beyond that sensationalism if you dont let yourself be distracted you can see whats actually taking place right now and you see people all over this country in all 50 states all 50 states and all over the world standing up against injustice standing up for racial equality standing up for black people who have contributed to the growth and success of this country just as much as anyone else but have never been able to enjoy the same freedoms as everyone else racism in America is real if you dont if you dont believe me scroll down look at the comments on this video but and when you dont think something is real when you dont think something is a problem because that something doesnt affect you personally thats called thats thats privileged now Im not scared of a cop not scared of police Ive never been scared when a police officer pulls me over my car Ive never feared for my life Im not concerned that I might not get a bank loan or at least in an apartment or get the full attention of a doctor in a hospital because of the color of my skin these things just dont occur to me and that that is privileged thats that thats privileged knowing knowing what to do with that privilege is really hard but you can use that privilege to hold other people accountable when you see racism taking place thats where it matters behind closed doors when no one is looking thats where progress can begin and vote voting is not sexy Loris never talking about voting is not sexy it takes time slow but voting works ella jones just became the first black mayor the first woman to be mayor of Ferguson Missouri and on that same day that she was elected mayor representative Steve King from Iowa vocal racists was voted out of office after 17 years thats progress though because this this right now this is our time and in this whole monologue by saying everyone loves to quote dr Martin Luther King they love to put his face on Instagram love to put his words on Twitter but ask yourself this when it was his time would you have marched alongside him because he wasnt loved then he wasnt celebrated he was vilified in the same kind of vitriol thats being used against the critics of this movement that betrayal was used against him hes dangerous hes inciting violence hes not protesting the right way hes racist when he and other nonviolent activists marched from Selma to Montgomery because because they wanted the same voting rights as non blacks they were met with violence and hatred would you have shown up so that was 50 years ago and that was their moment and this is ours and you have to honestly look in the mirror and knowing that this will be remembered ask yourself how do you want to remember your role in this and with that I say lets go lets put on our    boots because

is like a a direct action project direct action is my favorite way to give that means you just give money directly to people rather than going through a charity which maybe takes a small percentage for its overhead or anything like that you just just literally give money to people but you have to be really thoughtful when finding people to give money to so i asked my friend mike to help me out how are you doing man youve been good ive been good man we blindly asked people on social media you know if theyve been laid off from their job or if they were having a tough financial time and we responded by saying that we wanted to give them a care package the package is all over heres some right here this stuff is a commodity right here its a hot commodity i tried to get um some mass i couldnt get them all by today so the idea here is that the the actual care package is more just an excuse for us to give the cash thats right okay what are we doing now all right so um we have two people that are kind of close hopefully theyll want to share their stories with us and and theyll appreciate the care packages elijah you coming yes now not everybody wanted to be on camera or to share their stories so we just we just sent them money but some people did want to be on camera and did want to share their story and were local mind just reading a little of what this this person said to you yeah i cant work anymore and my fiance is the sole provider for us on top of that shes the primary kick my primary caregiver with covet 19 her pay was cut in half so so like many were struggling to pay the mortgage were coming to visit in groceries now yeah he does hows it going how you doing its nice out today right i dont have my gloves on but ive been spraying my hands you know so now before he was diagnosed with als a disease that took his ability to walk and cut his lifespan down to two to five years he was an emt a first responder were also giving people just a thousand dollars cash oh no    yeah and oh man now his wife there is the sole breadwinner but because of uh coveted 19 her hours have been cut in half how is that hows that pay cut impacting your ability to you know pay the bills yeah definitely put the stress on everything just uh with mortgage and then just care down the road for me with als its kind of like thats one more added pressure and stress to just think about he shared with us the the story of when he learned he had als it was a reminder that everyone has a story everyone has struggles and perspective really helps you appreciate what good you have in life bye guys best of luck to you like the fact that he has something like als and hes smiling and hes happy would that make you feel like um well it makes me feel grateful for what i have Music we live in an apartment about 800 square foot its not much but its a safe place to lay our heads and im grateful for it and i have my mom thats depending on me for help i filled out for unemployment so im waiting on that but im not giving up i have dreams that i will accomplish in my life mike and i are going around giving a thousand dollars cash i was in it all started both i had my dad my dad he was my names tony puerto rican from new york you know what i mean uh he was he would have been 70 this year you know um his birthday just passed actually but anyways um i grew up with him you know it was him with my mom i dont know why she was not out here but its a situation but theres so much value in taking the time to listen to others its its one thing to read a billboard that says were all in this together but to actually take the time to learn what a strangers day to day is is to appreciate that your problems are no greater or less than anyone elses thank you so um i havent worked in a month um due to the cobit 19 pandemic and it started with just a day at work as usual on march 13th which was a friday ill never forget it and i went from having a booked day to literally only servicing two people and not going back to work its been tough um i live here with my parents and my four three siblings four of us my parents have been working for anaheim area the corporation for about 30 years and this is the first time that you know theyve been out of work so right now i have like no income at the moment but my boyfriend has been helping me out like with buying me food and stuff and so its been trying to hang on to whatever we have right now Music hey Music i believe that everything happens for a reason i believe that there is greatness Music dies days on earth aint promised we just are living on broad time that theyre still hoping nowhere if we just come together Music unifying dont divide strength in numbers love each other thats where our true power lies i believe in la la message from above uh stronger than the bullets in a barrel of a gun gun beauty in the structure be proud of where you come from never let them see you down your journey only just begun i believe in happiness happen if you practice it activate your inner bliss then destiny will manifest i believe in truth so keep it g with what you say if i believe in you then will you promise to believe in me life could be heaven on earth as soon as you realize your worth live your life and you will find those dead minds that so uh in the end i connected with about 20 people some i connected with in person like you saw in this video some i connected with like you know on the phone some just twitter dms and then i cash at them a thousand bucks the last 30 grand i connected with these awesome volunteers out of the bay area theyre doing something called like the 1k project where they find families that are like about to lose their you know their way of life and they give them a thousand bucks a month so i gave the other thirty thousand dollars to these volunteers who are spreading it amongst a bunch of families that they met and they vetted which is wonderful if youre a rich person by the way thats a great way to help people that are really in need and give money directly to them um info on that is below and and then i do want to give a little bit more love to nordvpn um the the sponsor the company that like gave me the cash to do all this super awesome of them uh to be hip to this um if if you dont use a vpn you should you should use theirs because theyre cool uh link below for that but thank you again nord that was awesome okay you know my my biggest takeaway from this whole endeavor is is just to be reminded how important it is to be nice to people everybodys dealing with something so just just be nice especially right now okay uh good news so i sent this video to nordvpn for um just to like approve it before i sent it live and they they liked the video and so much so that they agreed to give me another 20 000 to give away nordvpn thank you you guys rock and um thats twenty thousand dollars thats going to get to go to um a whole bunch uh more families that that could really use it its great psyched okay bye for good Music,156.08617594254937,unemployment,0.0,1.0,sUm3mvZii6Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUm3mvZii6Y
My Best Friend Got The Coronavirus,2020-03-21T23:55:58Z,14.95,2620784,93251,so I shot this whole video yesterday about and just about cope at 19 and how its affecting my life and then this morning I got a text from my closest friend Dan Mays yeah I just I got a call from King for my doctor and he was like you positive and I was like positive for what hes like positive for the coronavirus Dans fine hes you know hes gonna be fine most of the effects of the corona virus hes already experienced and hes doing well hes just kind of hes hes the first person that I know hes the first person very close to me who has been confirmed to have the virus Candace put these outside of our house so you can before you before you come in I just I just cant get over how weird this whole thing is like how strange a phenomenon this pandemic is whats what feels different about this is that it affects everyone someone who lives in China and youre in Wuhan and you were the first person be affected by this or youre my friend in South Africa youre also affected by this Im affected by this and the clerk at the grocery store is affected by this its like we are all in this together and thats the thing thats the part thats thats strange for me thats the thing that makes it feel so weird its like there is no good guy and bad guy theres no no one did this to anyone and were just were all being impacted and because of that we we all have to work together to overcome this and I dont know definitely am NOT in my lifetime but I cant think of another circumstance in modern history where that has been the case globally were all in this together its 200 in the afternoon right now and this is like a line of people waiting to get into this grocery store how have you guys been dealing with just letting a few people in out of time and youre living in what people can buy so the kids are home from school keeping them busy during the day is really hard to do Candice is doing an amazing job of like putting together worksheets and curriculums and shes doing all the heavy lifting but its tough why do we have to wash our hands so much whats the coronavirus Music this street here is called Abbot Kinney its like a big shopping street near this street would be packed on a Friday these sidewalks would be as crowded as can be Ive never I lived near here Ive never seen it this this quiet down here and every store almost every store has a sign that says were closed Music the the weed store here is kind of the only store open on the whole street priorities california priorities in a day to day was just like you know were stuck in our house were just killing time we have been taking the kids out when we can be responsible they have to get out of the house while respecting social distancing were still doing family bike ride just get out of the house go around the block kids like and then Ive also been running and Ive been surfing every day yeah basically I like fell over basically I run and I serve and I run along this path here not a lot of people and then I I i surf right here in the water and when youre out in the water youre not near people so Im happy that my hobbies are socially distancing hobbies anyways I like to run I like to serve thats it I am glad Im here Im glad Im in Southern California mostly because we have a lot of opportunities to go outside and I think back to what it would be like in New York and while Im sad that Im not there to experience it and you know place it feels like my home Im definitely glad to not be there yo whats it like there bucks I just show you yeah dude look at Broadway it is it is an absolute ghost town Casey it is 70 degrees here any other day there would be millions of people out like this bus bus drivers wearing a mask and that bus is empty so its weird man its weird I wish you were here to just feel what its like here because Ive never experienced anything like I remember hearing about it it was like back in February it was in the news it occupied the same space in my brain that like the swine flu and bird flu and SARS all these diseases that like in my lifetime Ive heard about but theyre a little bit like the boogeyman like you hear about it but they I dont remember any of those Dizzys having like any impact on me personally I dont remember them ever actually like touching me and then like one by one things started happening the night that I found out Tom Hanks Tom Hanks Tom Hanks and his wife had contracted kovat 19 and then the NBA announced their were gonna have any more games that made it so that that moment made it so real for me like in that exact moment how do you feel now no Im trying my hardest not to panic but at the same time Im also thinking like I try to get a text and I got a doctor to come to my house this is in Los Angeles so doctor came to the house and he was like sorry you be not a lot of tests for coronavirus and I was like what do you mean you cant test for the coronavirus it was like we just not listening to any tests for the grandma thats who i confide in a doctor that comes to my house like a medical professional that said to me we not allowed to test for the corona virus unless its absolutely severe so you obviously dont have the virus and like i think that that mentality is wrong right if you had known when that doctor came to see you the urine had corona you wouldnt have flown to South Africa you wouldnt have seen you know ways with my parents because I didnt feel sick anymore I thought its a little bit weird but I didnt feel like I had the Korean virus one thing thats really super strange is if you played like Grand Theft Auto or youve ever been to Santa Monica or Venice you know lax is there so right here is where all planes take off like all day every day planes and there are no planes I like film this area with the zoom lens and all time lapse it no planes no plane from the sky Music like youre a healthy 29 year old what were the symptoms like was it bad yeah when I was trying to tell everybody I was like guys Im seriously sick somethings not right its in the doctor was like you know theres nothing we can really do except treated like a flu that couldnt like breathe properly that was the whole thing it was like my my lungs were so heavy and Id get keen and Id stand up I feel like I was gonna faint and then Ill go to sleep and wake up like 10 hours later what is going on I always wear a fanny pack now its really difficult to know like in your brain how to feel about something like this and it the feeling is overwhelming like I feel overwhelmed by this but thats contradicted by the fact that like Im genuinely not scared of the virus Im not scared of being sick I feel like those things I see is like inevitable like its Im definitely gonna get sick I hope Im less sick than more sick for whatever reason that part doesnt scare me Im able to understand and accept that the aspects of this that like scare me are the things that no ones working right now and you look at like numbers I was reading the New York Times an article about unemployment like a plication to get money unemployment checks and its the numbers are all off the charts I think of it in terms of my dad my dad has a coffee shop and hes like handling money and interacting with people all day so Im glad he closed it down but my dad has a bunch of employees and all this like food thats gonna go bad in the coffee shop and like this is my dads coffee shop so come here and then you realize its not just my dad but its all over the country all over the world thats what people are being confronted and that scares the that scares it out of me the scariest times in my life were those moments where I couldnt make ends meet and when you have an external force something thats out of everyones control and its preventing people from doing what they do to make a living which pays for their food that scares me so what does this mean for your wedding right its RINs two things its like obviously the weddings been postponed told the same man but then I was like gobs and I we were like we should still just go and get married like its some small talk South Africa and then I was planning all of that and I thought that that would be so romantic great but not leave my to the priest dad what the case is hes gonna come in the earth has mat su time stay home of wheat people and look anytime theres like a theres not gonna hurricane when theres big waves theres always that jerk out there surfing if theres ever a huge snowstorm in New York City theres some jerk who gets on his snowboard behind a truck and races around Manhattan just to be cool the thing is that jerk on that snowboard is putting himself in danger and maybe hes putting his friends in danger because theyre out driving when they shouldnt be to not heed the warnings of from the CDC from the w h o to not stay home to not respect whats being asked here doesnt just put you in jeopardy the way that I put myself in jeopardy by running around during a snowstorm it puts everyone in jeopardy that should be enough motivation to keep you at home that should be enough motivation to keep you away from crowds or any gatherings whatsoever so to end this one of the things thats been tough for me is not knowing how to help how can I help those in need so I had an idea to like make custom shirts or something and we could sell them and donate all the money to a non profit I dont know that were gonna be able to make shirts so instead Phan joy that does all my work so I said theyve got some old merch so heres what we decided if you go to shop Casey Neistat kampf you ever wanted to buy any of my old sweatshirts or t shirts weve discounted them and then a hundred percent of the proceeds so that means the cut that I would take in the cut that fan joy the company it makes my my merch the cut that they would take a hundred percent of thats being donated to feeding America PD America is a nonprofit that feeds you know people in need all over this country I also made a personal cash donation to feeding America but if you go to shop Casey and I STATCOM if you dont want to buy any of my old shirts which I understand theres a link there where you could donate any amount of money to feeding America which is the important part on their website it says one dollar can provide 10 meals to those those in need and also if you are someone in need you can find on their website where to find food banks and other places like that where you could find resources for you and your family if you find yourself in a compromised position because of all this are you using this boba you got it flip it there dont touch it hey Im thinking of all of you not just my fellow Americans but people all over the world who might see my YouTube videos who might be dealing with this and good luck stay healthy wash your hands a lot stay away from people all right Ill see you later Music you Music Music,145.685618729097,opportunities,0.0,1.0,rj25YHshXo8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj25YHshXo8
WE WENT TO MEXICO TO SURPRISE MY SISTER!,2020-03-11T16:35:41Z,9.016666666666667,1491084,56707,Im at the airport right now and Im headed to Mexico see its my sisters 40th birthday this weekend and shes having a huge party in Mexico I didnt think she wanted me there excited until I thought it was like a friends drinking party but then she started dropping these not so subtle hints at least I think they were hints I was like I got this nord VPN brand deal that I need to do and they they wanted me to show how it can be really useful when youre traveling so yeah why not use some of that brand deal money to surprise my sister at her 40th birthday party oh also also I decided to bring my favorite person isnt in the video in a while this is Owen my kid hey Owen hey Music Im in the window hes in the aisle and then you just hope that nobody chose to sit in the middle its a gamble but its a good gamble Music ladies and gentlemen welcome to king could mexico the local time is 445 shes celebrating and she has no idea were coming were in Mexico Im in a grocery store the surprise is getting better by the minute we found my little brother whos also here for the surprise we got a 40 minute drive from this grocery store to the hotel where my sister is heres what we bought so far big place crispy tree the single or of that stuff avocados and rice crackers Music all right were almost there the hotel is just up the road and check out this store we went by this pinata looks exactly like my sister doesnt that look like on Jordan looks just like this is gonna be the best birthday ever Music this is it weve got the pinatas weve got the goods we got someone on the inside Deans calling them now are you private in your Jordan in your Jordan okay dont freak out were in Mexico were coming to surprise Jordan where are you what room number what room number she could be anywhere in this hotel I gotta check in we gotta get all the stuff for the hotel room there we go surprise her in her hotel room this is it were going to do the big surprise now you just dont want her to see us as we approach the room work for one   can you open the door close you know get ready Music Applause Music so my little brother and Owen went sailing and then we did the breakfast buffet at this hotel and then my little brother already got on a plane and is now on his way back to New York City its been a fairly eventful morning so this brand deal with Nord VPN which I use as an excuse to come here to Mexico to surprise my sister who does provide me with a good opportunity to show you why VPN like Nord VPN is a very good idea when youre traveling especially traveling abroad alright so say youre in your hotel room in Mexico and its a strange hotel room that inexplicably has a gigantic bathtub just in the middle of the room near the beds you need internet you connect to the shady Hotel Internet which could expose you it also could let the hotel sort of monitor and snoop all of your internet traffic and all that stuff by using a VPN by using Nord VPN all of your internet traffic goes to an encrypted server one of North servers and then out to the Internet also with Nord you can connect to a server thats back home in the United States or wherever you live and then sites that behave differently depending on which region you connect them to like when you connect to netflix from abroad its like totally different movies and stuff and when you try to go to YouTube and youre in a foreign country by going through one of those servers that is in the same location where you live and all of your internet traffic looks like its from in my case the United States so go the links below but go north VPN comm port slash Casey if youre interested in this if you use code Casey you get 70 off a three year like a three year subscription so ends up being three dollars and fifty cents a month definitely worth it and thanks again Nord for sponsoring youtubers and letting me do this crazy idea as part of our our brand deal see you later oh and do you think Jordan was surprised kind of well you think she was fully surprised yeah well you think whatever her friends ratted us out no I just dont think she was thats I dont know she was so surprised she was so surprised Music so our flights in like four hours were gonna try and cram in one proper Mexican adventure before we go get back on the plane wait wait wait where are you going come back here hello I think it sucked oh and they only have a three and a half hour tour we only have one hour what do we do we cant even go swimming in the Music its run a totally different place oh and negotiated that we could go swimming in the do something for like an hour here whats that noise thats a little higher than I expected yeah well it just looks I think it looks more shallow than ready okay we are deep in the cave what now on you sure okay hold this drop Music Music well this concludes our Mexican trip oh and we havent had a father son vacation in a while I know this is short but how how was it it was great Music Music Music you

"FASTEST CAR, YOUNGEST DRIVER - driving a $200,000 sports car with Lando Norris",2020-01-10T22:08:09Z,9.516666666666667,3721387,123286,Music hey this is a sponsored video this video is sponsored by

these barricades everywhere and that makes it just impossible to cross the street which means in order to cross the street youve got to take these sky bridges everywhere and the sky bridges dont let you cross the street they lead you into a casino and you gotta find your way through the casino do you alternately pop out on the other side and they gotta figure out where you are now the solve for this is obviously a boosted board but they dont really let you fly with them anymore it did the impossible I got a boost support on an airplane what I found is if you fly with the board with the battery removed then you put the battery in a separate bag then you separate out the hardware and the wrench needed to reassemble well then airport security has less of a problem with it now do they just have no idea what theyre looking at and all your Las Vegas transportation problems solved Music Applause Music it really changes the dynamic of the city when you can bomb up and down Las Vegas

WHAT JUST HAPPENED?,2020-01-02T13:00:00Z,10.083333333333334,3017909,176738,Music Music ah Britany what does it say so I woke up this morning a 38 year old guy whos married and has three kids when did that happen Music Applause Music 93 Music Applause Music Applause are you are you older are you young yeah how old are you Music time is not equal the older you get the faster it moves I just mean that when you think of the the scope of your life thats a unit of time we all understand uniquely Im 38 I know what 38 years means and 1 year as a percentage of that is pretty small but 4 so we all get one lifetime this is the constant no matter who you are how long you live you only get one lifetime in a year the years that make up a lifetime well this becomes the variable Im 38 shes 5 Ive got 38 years Bernies five five years so as a percentage of my whole life a year is only 26 percent of that life but for Franny whos five one year for her is 20 percent of her life a year for me is seven times faster than a year for her remember being a little kid remember how long a year seemed it was like an eternity now think back to last year and the thing that Ive only recently the thing that Ive recently come to appreciate is how much of that life you spend focusing on the future versus focusing on the past this is my notebook from 2003 this crazy chart here its just labeled dominate and its my my plan to dominate in life written in 2003 now I was young then I had accomplished very little so when I thought of my life when I took inventory of what my life was it was largely aspirational is about where I wanted to be in the future not what Id done in the past so this is life this is where you start this is where you end and this is me a life is defined by the things youve done in the past as well as the things you aspire to do in the future looking ahead looking back and as I grew up especially as it became like a teenager and when I moved to New York City I realized that what define me were my aspirations were the things that I wanted for myself in the future so if you imagine me in nineteen year old me and saying 19 or old case hed tell me about yourself I wouldnt have talked about my past I wouldnt have talked about the c minus I got in 10th grade English other than a job that I hated her that I lived in a tiny apartment with three roommates I would have talked about my future the things I wanted to do the life I wanted to build my dream my aspiration I lived in that future and thats what defined me that started looking back I realize Ive accumulated a lot in life in my in my 20s Ive accumulated so much that defined who I was I was still largely defined by my aspirations but my past started to started to feel like it was contributing to who I was then Music and now I find myself here Im almost 40 Ive lived through my 20s Ive lived through my 30s and I slept my aspirations but so much of Who I am has been defined by my past now you like this room oh my god Music leaving high school leaving my parents house having a kid moving to New York City September 11th thats 20 year old Casey riding my bike up the Westside Highway to get away from get away from the towers getting my first real job quitting my first real job being single meeting Candice getting married starting a family I feel like a dozen years of trying finally figuring out my career yes Im starting a proper and daily vlog that fear and uncertainty that that really defines early adulthood all of that is in my past life life is this freight train and it leaves the station slowly but it picks up momentum and it goes faster and faster and faster and then you wake up one day and its 2020 and youre not a kid anymore and you become that adult that you remember when you were kid you remember looking at thinking Ill never be that old but you will be that old and theres nothing theres nothing you can do to change that Music Applause Music Applause happy 91st birthday there thank you sweetheart what would I do without you KC how does it feel to be 91 she was my hero that was my grandmother when she was a kid she discovered her her love for dancing that was her passion her dreams she realized it her whole life and I remember vividly having this conversation with her just before she died just after that video of her birthday was taking place were in her dance studio the walls are covered in pictures from her career like her performing for the troops during World War two her on Broadway in the late 1930s and I said to her I said Nana I said Nana your life has been so exceptional your past so extraordinary but what do you think about in terms of your life when you think about the future Nana which of your upcoming birthdays would you say youre looking forward to the most and she said in her infinite wisdom I dont think about the future and then she said and this is the point this is the point of all and then she said but but when I wake up in the morning Im so grateful to have one more day that that is what I focus on I focus on right now I try to think about that every day I try to think about that every day when I wake up I know from experience that spending too much energy romanticizing the past or dreaming about the future can come at the expense of appreciating today and Im not 92 years old and I hope Ive got a long long future ahead of me but I dont know what I do know is that Ive got right now and thats pretty great Music Ive said it before and Ill say it again life moves pretty fast if you dont stop and look around once in a while you might just miss it I said it before and Ill say it again life moves pretty fast you dont stop and look around once in a while you could miss it

a horrible situation,2019-11-09T22:29:04Z,8.0,2225971,85725,Music out of a late one last night its early but I gotta tell you this story see this this isnt supposed to look like that this is a normal collar bone this is a totally messed up Colin see how it sticks out normal not normal normal not not normal Music so this is this story of how I broke my collarbone in two places into three pieces about eight weeks ago Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music now my dear friend Jesse invited me to a thing called Burning Man basically fifty thousand people in the middle of like a desert riding bikes looking at light up arent objects but to be totally clear my main motivation in going is because I want to hang out with Jesse hes one of my closest friends now most people go to this thing for like a week or two weeks or something like that I had one night mostly because Candace didnt understand why I wanted to leave the family to go ride a bike in the desert now because I only had one night I couldnt drive in it was far away I had to fly there and I should have known when things started to go wrong at the airport that maybe this trip was not meant to be Music now this wasnt like a regular commercial airline they have these little propeller planes and fly you there and then we have great on the desert now you have to look at months in advance which I did and theres only like a couple of these flights now naturally I missed the flight now because it was such a tiny little airport there werent any terminals or like any like it wasnt a desk theres just one dude sitting there behind the counter thank you but I asked this guy there any other flights is there anything I could do and hes like no that was like a plane that was chartered by the event it was one plane and thats it the only other flights leaving are like peoples private jets taking them to other places so I decided to sit there and ask if anybody was going to like Black Rock Desert or the place where I was going so I was literally hitchhiking in like a private jet Airport terminal now the first couple of people I asked werent even going there they looked at me like a crazy person like why are you asking to on our plane then then I saw some people in funny outfits and I knew they were going where I was going but those people said no they were going the same place but they said no they were like look we dont know you and we dont want you on our flight it hurt my feelings but I kind of understood I dont know if Id want me on my private flight either and then sure enough these two dudes come walking in like an hour later their names were Pasha Pasha and Georgie they were great we had an amazing time in the plane they had like their own private jet then I got there at like 10 oclock at night like eight hours later than I was supposed to get there and keep it by it I was only supposed to be there for one day now this place is huge the size of a city and theres no cell phone service there so Ive got a fine Jessa now I brought my one wheel balance thing with the wheel pedal that has a motor takes me about an hour using the information I have now when I found Jesse he was leaving me a note on the door of his Winnebago that said Casey weve been waiting the whole day but couldnt find you and then there was like if you find this note tears were to look as he was paying that up was what I found it it was amazing it was like a very joyous celebration so then Jesse and I and Jesses girlfriend like hold Flicka friend she got in our electric bikes and we went out exploring whose fun a lot of fun and as that amazing night was winding down all my friends and I decided to ride our bike out the middle of nowhere to watch the Sun Rise but my flight was at 800 am and it was already like 6 am I was like 2 hours left so I decided I decided to leave the group and go off on my own to one last one wheel ride just like just to take it all in before I had to leave now for whatever reason Jesse decided to come on this ride with me so like one minute into the ride I was like Jesse dude youre beautiful loving girlfriend is back there by herself during the sunrise romantic month go be with her dont come with me and he was like all right Casey thank you for saying that and he went back with his girlfriend and I continued by myself into the desert so there I was floating along the Desert Sun coming up the most beautiful scene ever it was it was hypnotised and then out of nowhere I must have hit a hole or something because the one wheel it tipped forward and I went fly and the second I hit the ground I knew I could feel the snap I reached my arm into my shirt and I feel where there was like a bone like like a bone but instead of a bone it was like it was like sticking your hand into a warm bowl of mashed potatoes I knew I knew immediately that it was broken I just didnt know how bad it was broken I knew I was hurt but I didnt want to have to like wreck my friends remaining time there by being like help me I broke myself so I decided to deal with it all alone I decided to deal with it by myself so I went back to the RV where jesse was staying I cleaned myself up I even left them a little note it said Tony and Jessies TJ see you in Venice love faces with no explanation I was worried that you didnt have a good time I knew that everything is why didnt tell you anything and then I got back on my one wheel with the busted shoulder with my backpack and I went the nearest like emergency tent and someone helped me so thats the story Ive been to the hospital here in Los Angeles like three times since to get it looked at and checked out Im expected to make a full recovery in about another month but yeah thats a great story about a horrible situation Music

$400 Mavic Mini Drone; GARBAGE or great??,2019-11-02T15:09:44Z,8.933333333333334,4644763,97337,Music amazing hello from sunny at Southern California and welcome back to another tech Tuesday technology review this week well be looking at the latest from DJI the Mavic mini first lets have a look at whats in the box Music instruction manual three batteries USB charging thing and the drone itself with controller charge I think charging cables an important detail here is this review is of the Mavic mini Wymore combo the five more combo is comes with the extra batteries and like the propeller guards in this cool case extra propellers but its a hundred bucks more I dont know if you need all that stuff maybe the batteries are worth it I mean I appreciate the gesture DJI but does anybody use propeller guards its 2019 but this is this is the money right here this is all you need this this is the drone the controller this thing feel how light that is crazy right all right am i drawing back now its really wild how tiny this thing is this isnt the first small drone but this thing is like it feels its its very small ready iPhone Mavic mini it very small its very small its tiny its really super small Justin Im making a video about the new drone and Im trying to like explain why 249 grams is a big deal okay so what does it mean as far as the FAA goes as long as youre not commercial what you cant do with so while there are laws that define how and where you can and cannot fly drones and how you should fly them and all that where it gets really grey is when the drones wonder 250 grams and thats why DJI made this one exactly 249 grams this was not an accident they wrote it on the box they even have it written on every single drone right there 249 grams and while this doesnt give you permission to be reckless with your drone it does give you certain freedoms in it absolves you have certain responsibilities that you would have with a drone thats any bigger thats one gram bigger than this now for the flight test portion of this review Im going to be comparing Im gonna be comparing the Mavic meanie to my favourite drone currently on the market dollar for dollar what I feel is the absolute best drone you can buy which is the Mavic pro 2 you can use this for professional use and it does the trick this thing is absolutely amazing I also use it with the pro controller this this is the best but this combination this controller in this drone come in at a whopping two thousand one hundred and ninety dollars or something like that and Im gonna be comparing its quality and capabilities to this which is three hundred and ninety nine dollars and eighteen hundred dollar price difference lets see how it does Music Music okay but you guys ever seen a broom this fall thats right Music sighs poor man so small this Wilson give it back give it back I mean there is a definite difference between the video quality of the like 2 200 drone versus the 400 mini drone but if youre using these things for like YouTube or youre using them for family videos or anything like that I dont think you need that pro quality the video on it isnt just good enough its its I think its very good and when you combine that very good with that insane price point I mean it seems like a big winner the only question I have is how does this drone not cannibalize all the other more expensive drones that DJI sells and maybe a bigger question how is any other drone manufacturer how is any other drone manufacturer supposed to compete with DJI when they can make something that small that easy to fly with that kind of quality for 399 bucks almost really did almost fall off my my bike there Music you Music my Music Oh Music when I see you Applause Music,78.02238805970148,responsibilities,0.0,1.0,N9NH0Jqh7Is,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9NH0Jqh7Is

good to be back you know what it kind of feels like its like when you break up with a lover a girlfriend or a boyfriend or whatever and then you go and you see that person again and you only have all your old memories of what your relationship with that person was like so your expectations are based on its the same and youre the same person its the same city but it feels different because its not its not like I dont its good to be back but it it feels it feels weird I feel like a tourist in my own town Music do you remember this place are you doing I literally dont have any keys to my own office I remember my old studio still work in progress getting there getting there wall hanging not that huh no its great I dont remember the code ah its so good to be back I had to uh I had to text my old assistant to get the key code to get into my own office its good to be back package from YouTube they sent this to me before I move I didnt get it we hope youre moved from east to west is as smooth as it can be of your friends at YouTube its a framed screenshot of New York City from one of my videos its one of those disposable like coffee cups but its ceramic thanks YouTube so whats it like to be back in here well for starters I dont think I ever realize how cool this space is by gosh incredible in here but more seriously a friend of mine who moved from New York to California same move we did said you dont you miss New York City you dont miss being in New York City and I think thats true its dark and cold and rainy and theres trash everywhere its like a harsh place to be this city but its amazing and the idea of it and what the city represents and what this city is is something that I romanticized and I missed and I I like I long for it in California but being back here reminds me that like this city just like everything else in life has its virtues that make it great and then they have the things about it that are kind of tough it was those things those theres the parts of this city that make it so harsh that motivated us to move our family 3 000 miles away and even being back here for like 12 hours really brings that into light Music its 500 am in New York City 5 am Music Music so this is the work thing that I came back to New York City for hey there Casey back in Los Angeles here this is an ad a sponsor for this video from Nord VPN Nord VPN is a VPN that I use and I used before they became a sponsor of my channel and they do a number of things that I find incredibly useful more it has thousands of servers in 61 countries so one of the things that I do when travelling abroad is I connect to a server back here in the United States of America so when I go to Netflix or other sites like that that work differently in other countries they work just the way they did when Im here in Los Angeles this is especially useful in places like China that have a firewall that prevent you from going to YouTube useful in countries that dont give you access to Netflix also when I connect to the internet like in that hotel Im staying in New York when I go through Nord that hotel cannot monitor my Internet traffic and Nord VPN does not log my data or any of its users data which means theyre not keeping track of the sites youre going to and for a limited time you get 70 off a three year plan Nord VPN comm   Casey the special offer means that your

MY LiFE iN LA,2019-10-08T14:30:06Z,9.383333333333333,3555291,206340,thats cool Ferrari there is so much to catch up on Music it really is amazing here so when I moved here when I came to California had to like two big picture goals wanted us to really slow down in life I wanted to slow down so I could spend more time doing things like being with my family and doing things that I like doing in a city everything but work I wanted to move here and work less Music if you Music so this is my new studio this studio is actually just a small room above my garage this is it and I love it I mean its really fantastic here um but the space isnt done yet so Im not going to do like a formal studio tour that will have to happen in it in a different video so this video is called my life in LA and to kind of cut to the chase life here so far is really good whats it whats it like with me since we got the California Music Ive still been running a lot almost every day but instead of running on like the concrete of New York City and running on the beach but the running out here has been fantastic and beyond just the environment the weather its like this every single day its never not sunny here but Ive also been but Ive also been doing a lot of hiking like trail running trail running this kind of running its like its easier on the joints easier on the knees but also what a great way to see Los Angeles Music little things like I go everywhere on this super 73 I almost never get the car loads shes my first love but the bikes are kind of come Plus room for a passenger usually my passenger is Francine not not Dan and yeah I always make sure that the kids wearing a helmet when shes on the electric bike when shes on the super 73 with me the other thing Ive been doing a lot up here that I really enjoy is surfing Im pointing to this surfboard here I say that was a gift from YouTube surfing something Ive always wanted to do I always wanted to learn Ive always wanted to be good at but Ive never really had the opportunity but kind of close to the beach here so Ive Ive been doing it yeah I just love being on the water I also love being away from cellphones and being away from social media and being away from other people and being in nature certain things very quickly becoming my second favorite sport but I havent been surfing much lately you see I broke my collarbone here a couple weeks ago it was a pretty severe break so youd characterize that as severe so thats thats thats like the fun stuff Ive been doing those are the activities Ive been doing to pass the time and try my best to like you know and enjoy the fun parts of life but all that all that enjoying life and building a life around family and all this fun stuff that Ive been doing since we moved here all of that is in the shadow of what was like the hardest probably most tumultuous like five years of my life professionally as long as youve known me work has been my life and everything else including family has been on the sidelines and Ive never been like Ive never been honest with myself about thaks I think it took taking a minute to look at it were just Ive been doing here to realize that to realize just how much I put everything on hold for the hustle for the grind for for finding success in my career and I would describe like the last couple month last two and a half months here with all the fun and all the family and all this enjoying life it feels like rehab but instead of going to rehab to overcome an addiction to a substance I like Im in rehab to overcome an addiction to work I dont know that Ive completely overcome my addiction to work I definitely havent I havent overcome the passion that I have to to make things but taking these couple of months in this huge life change just to sort of take inventory on in my life and what my life is and what my priorities are theres been a couple of big takeaways Music Ive always been aware of how amazing life is of how amazing my family is and how amazing that Im a healthy person and how amazing that I get to do what I do for a living none of thats ever been lost on me but theres been this weird emotional reaction to it and Candace calls it I think its Candace told me this but impostor syndrome imposter syndrome can be defined as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evident success Impostors suffer from chronic self doubt in a sense of intellectual fraudulence that override any feeling of success or external proof of their competence I think thats a little extreme I guess what Im trying to say is like Im happy and Im fortunate and Im thankful for this life that I get to live hitting this hard reset of moving across the country of taking a moment not to work and enjoy my life and the people that I love has has forced me to sort of reconsider how I live my life and what my priorities are so with that moving ahead Im putting my family and my health and all those kinds of things those are now my number one and its a promise I made to myself and something that I want to maintain Im still going to make youtube videos and if I make too many videos please put in the comments Casey stop making videos go play with your kids Music mr Music oh sure Music you know Music Applause missing

My New New Studio,2019-08-14T16:41:02Z,11.116666666666667,3174926,100087,hey there uh lets talk about my studio I mean sure I guess first we could talk about my hair I could use a little trim alright so I dont have I dont have a studio out here in California yet theres like the little room above my garage and Im trying to turn into a studio its not ready yet but a lot happened to my New York City studio before I left the city if you remember I had like two two Studios connected and it made one studio and I had to give the big side back so I did take this much space and this much stuff and put it in this much space and make it this much stuff and it was a hell of a process so lets go back to New York City right now hey guys whats up here Casey from back in New York City in my studio I just want to say thank you to whoever sent me this puppet the resemblance is uncanny okay so Im sure from your perspective this place looks unchanged but I assure you the changes are significant and I want to get into all of them including the fact that where there was once an entirely other studio theres now a wall remember the boosted boards used to be on the red wall no more boosted boards okay well get into that but first I want to show you what used to be the other half of the studio Music it looks given there so I can shoot this video but its a disaster out here so this is probably the perspective youre most familiar with this used to be like my desk but I used to sit right here and then and then like this wall wasnt here and this was this is the studio behind me here was like where my wall of surveillance was and I had the monitor here that had the like the godfather playing on the loop that was I was there this is my desk this is where I work all day every day hey back in California again sorry for the interruption I needed some like really good footage of the studio before all this construction took place so I Im using footage from a video marques Brownlee made about my studio its one of the most neat and organized spaces awesome video if you want to see it its linked below on Marquezs channel but marques I hope its cool that Im just stealing all your footage of my studio okay the crown jewel of the studio my polaroid wall Music these are all the pictures every one of them and of course they saved a book the time am I the speed bag still here its still here consider was taking the space wants to use it I cant blame it I remember building this thing in this trash heap here this used to be it this is where all my cameras were the big screen was here with the gaming setup and the couches over there now its just a hollow shell Music knowing that what you see my studio is being put to really good use Sam Sam Sam nice to see you its the first time weve ever met are you so proud of your son very proud me too and thank you for your help Sam I was just saying it well maybe its a little bit sad but its like its like a new chapter I think for both of us and I have like big big shoes to fill its not so sad to give that space up knowing that youre gonna be in it Sam Ill see you in California definitely Ill see you like a week probably Music hey so this

a super good deal noor VPN dot com   kc noir VPN dot com   kc Thank You Nord for sponsoring my video and also thank you for sponsoring a lot of YouTube channels really appreciate it Nord VPN comm  k C thats got to be the most nostalgic Nord VPN commercial ever made this process really brought me back to when I first got this studio like 15 years ago and we had one room and we had to make it work so let me share with you some of the big changes in here so the biggest biggest change is this wall here per my like lease with my landlord I had to hire contractors to build the wall and then I had to turn that wall into something now making use of my new wall was really easy because this used to lead to the other half of the studio which is actually like 60 of my square footage of like the real estate of this space so I had to take a hundred percent of stuff and cram it into 40 percent of space so utilizing this wall was instrumental to that this is the wall maybe its better with it better so I moved all the skateboards over here all the boosted boards here use the space above them to provide a nice film collection my body armor my ladder bolt cutters tiny skateboard work harder light and you know some other tchotchkes and stuff I also built this monster shelf above above the wall there to put the to put the paintings Music next in the world of big changes is this station here these two stations here if you remember thats where the boosted boards used to be now thats where Ive got two stations is my Mac here its my PC back here some of the cameras the ones I still sort of use are here power down here its a shallow desk because its just meant for like sitting out and editing this is not like a at any event I think it feels good its an efficient use of space shout out to our main gear theyre the ones who built the custom KC PC in a space like this especially we have as much stuff as I have you have to take advantage of every square inch now I did I actually did I considered throwing away my books sometimes you just cant store everything cant be a hoarder sometimes if they throw things out even if theyre important but I didnt saved all of my books which required us to to build these bookshelves all the way up here not an easy feat these walls here are made out of these walls theyre made out of plaster its hard to get anything to stick to them but very proud of the bookshelves and the hardest part of this whole process was what to keep and what to let go up there was way more letting go of things than there was keeping things and thats not easy the general rule I tried to adhere to was if I dont use it or didnt know I had it no matter how cool it was how fancy the equipment was how how much nostalgia I had attached to it I didnt even know it exists it I just we just got rid of it there was a lot of getting rid of stuff there were a lot of aspects of the move from New York City leaving New York City that were emotionally like really hard for me but this wasnt I mean this was technically hard as a huge pain in the ass doing all this but this wasnt there was no this was like a fun exciting part of the moving process knowing that when I come back to New York even though I dont have a place to stay that I have this studio to look forward to is oh really its a its just an exciting thing its also kind of nice to know that when Im in LA Angeles a little part of me is still here taking up like 300 square feet for its where its not for Fe 250 square feet in downtown Manhattan so I that means you feel good its its like a little window that I left open that I can come back through any time so I think we did a good job with it I think the way that the new mini studio turned out is awesome its been like two and a half three weeks since I left New York and Im excited to go back Im gonna start to be back and work out of that space as far as like building a new studio here its been way more exciting and way more refreshing than Id anticipated so Im very excited to share whenever its done my new California studio and Im also just super psyched to be building that out okay All Right see you see you next time Music I like our culture is so cool,158.5007496251874,surveillance,1.0,1.0,dSmsQraeCVM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSmsQraeCVM

this is the end.,2019-07-18T20:45:03Z,13.266666666666667,5502485,240126,Music Music well this is it this is the last page the very long chapter goodbye Applause Music Applause Ive only ever had one one mission in life and that mission has been to simply realize the promises I made to myself when I was a kid when youre kid youre always telling yourself when Im an adult Im gonna do this all right I dont have to listen my parents Im gonna do that someday Im gonna grow up and do see those goals those ambitions my very first dreams in life were to simply get away from the people who told me I couldnt some of my high school teachers my parents friends Im the people who were supposed to be guiding me in life the people who made a kid feel small because he was different that was the world that it felt like I grew up in and my goal was to get away from that and the answer that was simple the answer was to go to the place where you could be anything you want it to be to go to an island where all the misfits in this world go to in that place was was New York City Music New York City is a place where you can do anything and be anything because everyone is too damn busy to worry about what anyone else is doing Music its a place where youre all at once surrounded by thousands of people but are entirely alone left your devices to do whatever you set out to accomplish Music no one lives in New York City if you simply survive in this place and that weeds out the wheel and that social Darwinism leaves you with eight and a half million other people looking to make their mark when Frank said you can make it there you can make it anywhere he wasnt talking about Paris Tokyo and London the sure    wasnt talking about Los Angeles greatest city in the whole world New York New York its 1100 in the morning day two of the road trip in just outside of Indiana still in Ohio about to cross into Indiana so Candace wanted to come with me on this trip and I had a number of friends who I love offer to come with me on this trip but I wanted to do this drive alone 3 000 miles five days alone Im never alone I never get time alone and when I think about jumping into this next phase of my life theres not a whole lot of solitude in that either so this this for me seemed like a really good opportunity to to be by myself and think about I dont know its a huge change in my life you need some time to process it thats what thats what this trips about Music but in realizing that ambition and realizing that dream at age 20 there were consequences I got this and I got that at a price and probably this the scariest or the shittiest repercussions of moving to New York City with nothing no no education no career path no jobs no opportunities the biggest consequence of that was it was tough for this little guy it was tough for my kid Music for all the romantic notions of moving to New York City all of which were true it also meant not getting to be the father that I wanted to be daddy how come I dont get to see you as much as I want to see you are you gonna pick me up from school this week or do I have to wait till next week that was tough and that struggle gave birth to all new dreams and aspirations Applause in this part of the story younger case he wasnt Casey the little kid but younger case he was now you know 20 year old Casey who lived in New York City which was the coolest but lived a pretty shitty life in New York City making ten bucks an hour and not being able to spend the time with my kid that a good father should be spending with this kid and out of that came all these new dreams and these new dreams and aspirations were a little bit less selfish they they were less about me there were things like oh I dont have a house to raise my kid in thats a big dream thats a dream for a lot of people is a big dream for me you know another one was I never got to go to college and I had a goal that if my son ever got to go to college no matter what that school was that I would figure out how to pay for it for him those were my new dreams those are the promises that Ive been working towards for the last 18 years in New York those were the promises that had made to myself when I was younger that I had to realize Music and then like five six years ago I started figuring    out and I started making money and I started I started making it and when he was applying to colleges three years ago his only concern was getting in not figuring how to pay for it so then what whats the next generation whats the next cycle of promises that Ive made to myself as Owen got older was when Candis and I started getting more serious and it occurred to me that I might get to be a be a dad again and I might get to have a family a more traditional looking family structure than what I had with Owen I might get to realize a whole new wave of promises that I made to myself when I was struggling to be the dad that I wanted to be for him when I had kids again Music Music yeah Music Music what would it mean to be a dad who got to see his kids every single day seven days a week what would it mean to wake up in the same house as my children every day what would it mean to get to be present because even in the last couple of years when you were there this audience was there when I was daily vlogging I was finding success and promises realized that I could have never imagined but the expense then was I was never present I was home with my kids every night house thinking about work I was getting him dressed in the morning but I was to focus on my startup how am I company and when I was dropping the little ones off at school Im thinking about my employees how am I gonna meet payroll I wasnt present in this last cycle of promises had a whole lot more to do with who I am as a person and who I am to other people than it did with material or physical things if I had to pinpoint the promises that Im currently working to realize is to be a person who operates not out of ego but someone who operates with a priority to connect with and be kind to and loved and to be better to the people around me Music see Music a painful reality of that ambition is that I i cannot realize it in New York City I cant do it here you see no one is in this city because they want to relax no one is here because they just want to slow down in life no one is here because they want to focus on family or personal relationships or improving themselves this city is 9 million people packed on a tiny island everyone chasing something down and that something is is a career there is no escaping it there is no conversation you will ever have in New York City that doesnt end with you talking with another person about your career and your goals and how youre gonna get there Ive been here for 18 years and that pretty much sums up every human interaction Ive ever had in this city and that is what makes it great unless youre not on that path and I want to step off that train so Im leaving Im out Im saying goodbye to the city that I love and Im making this video because Im trying to convince myself Im making this video because I am Not sure but if Tarzan never let go of the vine that he was swinging from to grab the next one he would have never gotten to the other side of the jungle he just would have sat there swinging back and forth so my love for what this city is and what its given me should not preclude me from embracing whats next and thats what Im doing and thats what shutting down this studio moving to Los Angeles thats thats

i'M Leaving NYC forever..,2019-05-10T18:24:16Z,8.75,4208758,150103,hi and nonot clickbait Ive mentioned it Ive brought it up Ive talked about it on this channel a lot in the last three years but after 18 years in New York City Im leaving theres theres a lot theres a lot to unpack here a lot to unpack with what does it mean for me personally whats it mean for 3 6 8 what does it mean for everything and Im gonna get into all of that but in this video I just see Im a big subscriber of the idea that life like a book life is told in chapters and you cant embrace the next chapter until you close the current one just this is a total coincidence that this scene happens to be happening in The Godfather right now this is when Don Corleone dies and micro Leone becomes the new Godfather in any event life is like a book you cannot embrace whats next until you change the page and the chapter Im closing here is New York City now if Im looking at life from like the broadest of chapters chapter 1 was like childhood through moving to New York that was like ages 0 to 20 and then ages 20 to 40 Im not 40 but you get the idea I was in New York City and thats the chapter that Im currently closing and when I think about all the things that Im gonna miss theres like one thing that really hangs which is this studio let me tell you a little like an abbreviated history of this studio and Ive already shared this with you forgive me but this is 15 years ago I had a day job and it was a good job and I got my first ever paid gig with video camera was like it was to direct a TV commercial I was like several thousand dollars I spent those several thousand dollars getting this studio space and I quit my day job filmmaking making videos it wasnt a hobby for me anymore it went from being a hobby to being a career this space represents that were moving in July so 10 weeks from right now were and were were giving up our apartment here the apartment that Ive like raised my family in for last several years but because of 3 6 8 and other factors Im keeping like a tiny place here were keeping in place here so Candice has a place to stay when she comes back and I have a place to stay when I come back okay so with that I was like dude what do I do with the studio because its expensive its a lot to justify if Im not living in New York see do I need all of this and the answer is of course no technically as far as my landlord is concerned these are actually two separate spaces right here this is one space and this is the other space here look that space is 201 and then like this is 202 this is one space here this is technically inserted a second space I dont want to like romanticize this too much but see this wall right here this one thats all kinda bust it up I left it like that because knocking down that wall and expanding from this small space into that big space was such a huge deal for me that happened in like 2007 just as I had sold my HBO show to HBO we had money so my brother van and I we like this woman left this space and we took over Music Im gonna at least for now Im gonna keep this studio space here this small space this is 14 feet by 14 feet Im gonna Im gonna put this wall right here Im gonna put this wall back up and then this entire space is no longer gonna be mine as I leave Im contracting back to this original space where my whole career started so when I do come back to New York I have this little place to work and that leaves this big space this whole space is gonna be left behind this is what Im giving up yeah Im explaining that youre adopting half of my studio it feels a little like passing the baton like that was the space that I built my career and now and now I just sprint with my entire existence so its leaving me but its its not leaving the family and that makes me feel canvases parents are both in Los Angeles Janices sister is in Los Angeles her brother in law is in Los Angeles my sisters are now like big brothers in LA my little brothers in LA oh then ten miles of each other all right in the same spot and I think when you get older like your priorities are no longer about you they become about your kids and I I dont want to raise my kids without family and when you can stop and appreciate what you have which is something Im working harder to do instead of just bulldozing you ahead you can really see your priorities and my priorities right now are giving my kids a life that includes family and I cant do that in New York City this video was sponsored by Nord BPM true story Ive been using I personally

NOT GETTING ANY.. a discussion,2019-04-23T19:24:27Z,9.866666666666667,3678053,88146,this video is not not actually this video is not actually about our our sex life you didnt think Id make that video did you just a heads up in todays video I do talk about sex and while theres nothing graphic or descriptive in the way that I talk about it I do acknowledge its existence and wanted to give a heads up okay the share of Americans not having sex has reached a record high thats not having sex the share of US adults reporting no sex in the past year reached an all time high in 2018 okay as if thats not interesting heres where it gets real interesting among the 23 percent of adults or nearly one in four who spent the year in a celibate state celibate state means not you know that means a much larger than expected number of them were 20 something men meaning that nearly a quarter of the people who reported in the last year to not having had it were actually young and 20 something men I wouldnt have thought that all right then they can wanna think about other factors in the study like how old people arent getting it anymore they refer to it as the great American sex drought but this is the part that Im zeroing in on the portion of Americans 18 to 29 reporting no sex in the last year more than doubled between 2008 and 2018 lack of sex is driven mainly by the young percentage of people reporting no sex in the last year by age look at look at that orange line 18 to 29 year olds its surging then it goes on a little bit to theorized why this is happening doesnt get that much into it but it talks about how maybe people are getting married later in life in their 30s and 40s sure interesting thesis the labor force participation among men has fallen and it sort of suggests that if youre unemployed its harder to find potential partners than if you were employed that makes sense okay and then before I get into the last paragraph of that article which is the point of this whole video let me read you a different article that cites the same study this one is called young men having less sex due to gaming streaming and social media all right and then this article ends with the same sort of suggested conclusion as the other articles going back to the the Washington Post one one final factor they may be affecting American sexual habits at all ages is technology there are a lot more things to do at 10 oclock at night now than there were 20 years ago streaming video social media console games and everything else and then it concludes by saying that may speak the drop off among the sexually active this should come as no surprise to you but I havent I have an opinion on this whole thing and I guess this makes this video part three of three parts of Casey bitching about social media but I dont have a resolution here I just have I have a thought about this okay so my whole my whole thesis on this my own perspective on this is really only about one contributing factor but I think its probably the biggest contributing factor but this is just one contributing factor there are myriad others okay shows like this before before sex typically comes intimacy intimacy is much of closeness a familiarity a comfort in being near together with another human I think intimacy is something that we need us humans but I think a lot of what we used to get only from intimacy has been pushed out by social media the contact that we have on social media friends before social media your close friends thats like you know your boyfriends your girlfriends your friends that you hang out with on the regular maybe even your co workers people that you see on a consistent basis then you have a tear to like this now I distant friend a distant friend is someone whos absolutely a friend but maybe you dont see that often okay now we look at friends after social media at the core you still have your close friends and your distant friends group is still there as it always was but now theres this third friend group the tertiary level of friends and these can be called your social media friends so where things get great where things get ill defined in this with this new category of friends people used to see sometimes are sort of now lumped in with this huge category of social media friends social media friends people maybe youve never actually met before in real life or the you know hundreds of Twitter people you interact with maybe someone who comments on your Instagram posts maybe theres some facebooking involved there but people actual humans that you only interact with via technology I can I could probably name 50 people that I feel like I know but I actually maybe have met once in life Ive spent very little time with and I interact with them on the internet and they feel like real friends and there are real friends um whether you interact with them in real life infrequently are you interact with them only via technology its still human interaction and they are still its still a real relationship for me how I would describe my own experience is that so much of this interacting I do with others on social media which is tremendous I interact with tens or hundreds of people every day on social media its a she AITs it fulfills my desire to interact with people outside of my immediate friend group not too shy to admit that like if you know if Im feeling lonely or Im at home and everybodys asleep or I just throw on Twitter it all sudden it feels like Im surrounded by people and in conversation I can you know at reply to a total stranger whos asked me a question that fulfills my need for human interaction and it fulfills that need at the expense of what used to be an in real life friend group so then what is the difference whats the difference between people I used to interact with in real life and social media friends and theres one difference when i DM someone at reply someone I DoubleTap someones photo versus even a phone call but definitely versus seeing someone in real life the x factor is this is intimacy and Im referring to intimacy in the Platonic sense this is not a sexual thing I mean intimacy in a sense of closeness when I talk to somebody on the phone you can hear all the sort of intonation x in their voice you can pick up on little inflections you can say like whats wrong you dont sound the same those sorts of intimacys I dont think that happened on social media so in conclusion real life friendship can lead to intimacy which can lead to sex but social media friendships can equal less intimacy which can equal less sex not to speak from personal experience about the intimacy and friendships not about the sex stuff all humans needs some intimacy you need to be around other people when I needed that I would always find that with my real friends and I can tell you now I mean you look marriage and kids and stuff is a part of it but I also meet because of my social media friendships my desire to go out my desire to see people or hanging out with people is almost entirely diminished Im good I feel completely connected to the world and other people largely because of social media I think if I were to go back in time like 10 or 15 years and I lived the way and I lived the way then that I do now people would think Im like a hermit or someone who has no friends or just a crazy person because I see almost no one ever all right so this is the the last part in my three part series about my knee beef with social media I just want to answer why I dont have a problem with social media and when it comes to the sex lives diminishing the sex lives of Americans I mean look to each his own Im in no position to judge anyone for any reason the reason why I talk about this stuff on this channel is I find it fascinating whats particularly fascinating to me is technology social media cell phones these are assuring in a change of the way humans interact with other humans way faster than we are able to understand it and I find the more time I spend thinking about these things considering how they impact my life and my happiness and my brain and all of those things the more effective I can be in how I use them how I let them into my life or how I dont this morning I told Candace that I was gonna make a video today that was sort of about sex and then I needed to get a scene with both of us in our bed in any event Thank You Candice for being such such as for,161.95945945945945,participation,0.0,1.0,wX9OLMNShPQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX9OLMNShPQ
THE FIRST Galaxy Fold,2019-04-16T03:36:10Z,7.066666666666666,6178908,155969,okay so this is it this is the Samsung Galaxy fold the first folding phone just kidding thats two iPhones tape together this is the this is the per galaxy fold lets lets lets start with the unboxing comes in the box in the open position so I want to start the review by giving a really really good look at the hardware behind the behind the fold Music this big thick hinge here is what the two pieces like the two sides of the phone wrap themselves around when you open it theres no clasp built in here at all that click eNOS thats magnet in youre holding this thing together and I have to say its very satisfying the thickness when open is about that of a regular phone maybe a little bit thinner but when its closed when its closed its close to the thickness of two phones this is what it looks like next to two iPhones and two galaxies and yes there is a gap maybe a sixteenth or a 32nd of an inch but there is there is indeed a gap it is thick its thicker than most typical phones but I really couldnt notice the difference between this and maybe sliding a pair of sunglasses in or any of my other cell phones so this is it closed compared to other phones that maybe your food Music one of my big concerns is what the keyboard would be like but it works really well not that exterior screen there it is small its 47 inches its about the size of like the iPhone se of the iPhone 5s 47 vs I think the 45 the folded size it feels good like a like a regular phone especially when you have one hand if you like check Twitter respond to attacks or just take a phone call Music thats what Instagram looks like when its on their Twitter its all its all pretty usable I mean yes its obviously very cool to have a cellphone that also turns into a tablet but when is that actually worth it whats the point in actually having that and theres a couple of use cases that come immediately to mind driving is one of them maps maps are place where more screen more information easier to use when I go to the gym I typically bring a like an iPad or some sort of tablet to watch videos on and having a phone that turns into a tablet means its one less than I have to carry the screen is super high res super crispy its what youd expect from like a high end Apple phone or a samsung phone but there is a crease a lot of talk of crease that there is indeed a crease on the phone Music Applause Music you know what its like it really doesnt affect performance or anything it feels sort of like when Apple first announced a notch in 2000 whatever for the iPhone X everybody freaked out and you guys sort of get used to the notch well I think the crease feels the same it doesnt feel like its getting worse and you just sort of accept it as part of the device editor guys it is it is unfortunate though the camera and the Galaxy fold I believe is a is the same exact camera quality as in the nest 10 so okay whats not the same though is what its like using a camera phone that has an enormous viewfinder Music so much daily studies I told the other people at nineteen hundred and eighty dollars still like many many hundreds more expensive than the most expensive iPhone or galaxy phone I dont know how many people are gonna buy it in almost 2 000 whats way more exciting though is what this thing represents the original iPhone 2007 not since 2007 twelve years ago has there been really like a piece of hardware that has made people say like wow I dont know where thats going but that thats what I think the future is gonna look like and I look at this and if this is the first generation if its only gonna get better than this alright heres my long term prediction its at folding screens will usher in a whole new era in in mobile phones and mobile computing so right now we call these things cell phones or mobile phones but they are mobile computers and I think I think what a folding screen and folding screen tech enables these things to do is be both really good cell phones when we need them but also computers that can do so much more when we need that and thats what Im excited about you want to see it so this is the phone you see its like a regular cell phone here this is this the poor guy sitting next year I was recording my video hey its really really cool phone really cool yeah yeah vulnerable phone wait what its crazy oh my gosh how did you get this thats amazing,121.9811320754717,immediately,0.0,1.0,86Lr_tChDAU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Lr_tChDAU
"MANIPULATED, TRICKED, BRAINWASHED.. moving past a social media addiction",2019-04-01T16:44:23Z,14.133333333333333,1981703,69647,Music remember those whose glasses I used to wear that had like the white not a deeply philosophical reason its just that I lost them and making a new pair is a tremendous pain in the ass that place didnt have them Music Music Music good to do that it has been exactly 14 days two weeks since I posted a video called goodbye social media in that video is like paint chips Oliver in that video I talked about my addiction like a problem I have in my life where I spend too much time on my phone so I made a decision I still have Instagram I still have Twitter theyre just not on me so I have to check them on my laptop but I still have my accounts I just got rid of I got rid of the apps it was this every 20 minute that was making me go crazy not the fact these apps exists it was just my usage was out of control I spend two hours a day so two weeks later how do I feel well first let me talk about the bad parts about quitting social media bad parts I theres a connectedness that social media gives you like you know its the best way that Ive found to interact with even my YouTube audiences on Twitter not being on Twitter all day long means I dont get to have those conversations all day long I do miss the kind of interactions that I have had and always had on on Twitter genuinely missed that theres also kind of a recognition or validation that a youtuber uniquely gets on on Twitter and on social media if you post the video and all of a sudden theres all this feedback people talking to you about what they liked what they didnt like when you stop looking your phone every 20 minutes you lose that on Instagram I love Instagram stories its like its like a remote control flipping through cable but instead of cable its a show of every person that I know I you know I I check Instagram now for five minutes a day at the end of the day is not its not the same okay so those are some major things to lose those are major Downers now I want to talk about the good part of quitting social media FOMO fear of missing out fear is a really big deal its a heavy emotion and if youre going to be afraid of something that something should warrant that emotion and I dont think the kind of fear or fear of missing out that Twitter yields is worth the cost that cares heres what I call the foam olfactory and mostly Im looking at Twitter for this although Instagram also is a bit of a foam olfactory goes like this you open up Twitter you read some interesting information you close the app youre thinking about that information you want to know more about it so you open up the app then get curious read about different information you think about that so then you open up the app then you get curious for different information so you think about that and then you open up the app get curious different information you think about that you open up the app now that FOMO cycle has you consuming a lot of information so the cost of that cycle is youre filling your brain with all of this information so what is the value of that what is the return on that cost yeah I think the cost versus the value is is a very important equation so for me the cost of using Twitter or nearly an hour a day was all of my damn attention and the value the return was a little bit of information for sure but a lot of noise so if you think about maybe YouTube on the cost versus value equation the cost of YouTube is a lot of your attention but the value is you sort of know what youre getting yourself into when you click play on a video on YouTube youre consuming your 3 minutes 10 minutes whatever of something that you chose to engage in perhaps a better example is Netflix when I sit down in front of Netflix I click play on a movie or documentary order the hell Im watching the cost is my time and the value is that Im learning something new Im consuming somebody elses artistic creation its something that I appreciate yet sometimes its garbage but you get the point that Im trying to draw theres a lot less noise in other forms of media than there is on social media for everyone tweet you read thats really thought provoking and interesting theres a hundred tweets that are just knowing I know I make those tweets Im part of the problem with this I am the noise and I follow 1995 other people that are also making noise everybody commenting beneath them theres thousands and thousands of people that Im following that are all creating noise and so long as Im whipping this thing out fifty times a day its filling my brain with this noise so go back to the Netflix of the TV analogy its the equivalent of sitting down from television and just clicking the remote like this for like an hour every day or consuming two seconds of each channel its noise its static hang in there Im gonna take this to a positive place Im a big fan of social media Im gonna take it to a positive place let me let me finish Instagram I was spending more time on Instagram then I was spending on Twitter I was spending an hour plus on Instagram just a little bit less than an hour on Twitter I think of any social media app Instagram is by far the most addictive and I do think theres less noise when it comes to how your brain processes photos versus how your brain processes like you know 280 characters peoples ideas on Twitter I I think spending an hour plus on Instagram a day can be more destructive to my brain health then spending an hour a day on on Twitter and thats because of their algorithm the Instagram algorithm scares the everliving out of me and it should scare the out of you too this is gonna sound conspiratorial this is not conspiratorial you ever read about Facebooks like quarterly or biannual earnings calls basically like what the financial health of the company is Facebook beating expectations on both the top online reporting earnings of two dollars and ninety two dollars and 38 cents per share theres a couple of metrics that they always talk about they always brag about they talk about DEA use daily active users and they use monthly active users and how much time these users are spending on their sites on their apps on their on theirs on their networks now daily active users monthly active users both of those numbers coming in in line with expectations now what that literally means is not a conspiracy what that literally means is the more time you spend on their platform the more successful they are as a company top and bottom line growing far better than expected we see Facebook shares now up over seven percent okay to bring that full circle it is in the companys absolute unequivocal interest to build a product that is going to get you to spend as much time as possible on it these are programs designed to monopolize human attention by any means necessary because that is their business I stole that line by the way from New York Times I read that on there to monopolize human attention by any means necessary that is their business those that have moved off Facebook have moved to Instagram it shows up in the numbers you know what these guys might come back 2019 could be all sins forgiven so when you have Instagram on your phone I love Instagram I love Instagram but when you have it on your phone and youre doing this why every time and youre doing this all day every day every time you stop and you whip out that phone what are you looking at youre looking at Instagram why are you doing it because you need to see photos no because somebodys smarter than you definitely smarter than me wrote an algorithm thats designed to trick our brains into wanting to look at this program as much as humanly possible the intention of this video is not to just all over social media I love social media I owe my career to social media it has connected me with people I would have never met otherwise theres a lot of good to be said about social media but I also love candy and if I had candy in my pockets all day every day if I opened up my fridge who knows just filled up with candy ah thatd be me all I would he is candy and candies great but no one should be consuming candy at that velocity at that level at that amount of just like no one should and I think its the same with social media so all the big twitter users out there like me big twitter users when you wake up in the morning and like youre at your computer and youre first checking Twitter it feels really really refreshing youre like ah all this good stuff and youre interacting with people who may be at replied to you in the middle of the night or whatever and its about engagement and and all that it feels great and then like three hours later and youve like youve fallen into this like cesspool of negativity that that exists on that platform when you limit your access to the platform you avoid that cesspool of negativity because youre just not on there enough to to to be consumed by those little things like youre paying attention less theres a little bit of like ignorance is bliss but when theres that much noise that much static you need a little bit of ignorance you dont need to know I follow 2 000 people I dont need to know what all 2 000 people are thinking youre writing it every minute of every day restraint for me on Twitter has made me love Twitter more than Ive ever loved Twitter but I check it twice a day sometimes three times a day and it feels great Instagram remember an Instagram first came out youre like wow you can see what my friends are up to cool lunch Brad Wow Suzie your babys really cute oh I didnt know Jessica was in Paris remember when thats what it was so I feel like Ive gotten back to that when you check these apps infrequently when you check Instagram and frequently all the interesting stuff has bubbled up to the top and youre flicking through in the first 100 pictures the first five minutes you see all of your friends and the people you actually care about and then before you get to that place a place where I used to spend an hour a day of being like why am I looking at this stuff how did I get here by only spending a couple minutes a day on the platform I almost never sink to that gross place my name is Ellen DeGeneres and I am addicted to Instagram well how many people here are addicted to Instagram again for the tenth time this is not a video thats about hating on social media I like social media I think there are more good parts of social media than there are bad parts this is about addressing an addiction that affected me tremendously whether you think its an addiction or not if youre spending more than an hour or two a day on on these platforms it isnt an addiction so solutions to the problem that is the addiction not the problem that are with these social media platforms if the end goal is restraint or less consumption I didnt have the ability to like open it less when I said Im gonna cut down I just still all day so I deleted the apps which was pretty extreme and now what I do is I check it on my laptop a couple times a day or I keep my like one of my older cell phones at the bottom of my backpack and its charged so I can power that thing up and connect it to Wi Fi and check social media if I want but thats kind of a pain in the ass and that pain the ass factor keeps me from over consuming so if for me like the short of it is I just kind of put training wheels on my social media consumption its made me I think a more focused more present individual who stares at my phone considerably less and then its also and I didnt see this coming but its made me love social media again its made me love Twitter its made me love Instagram by having a healthy relationship with these platforms you can appreciate them for what I think the original intent behind these platforms was there were a lot of comments on the first video it was like this will never stick will be back on here in a week maybe thats still the case but my goal now is to never have these highly addictive social media products on me in my pocket on my phones at all times okay oh Im gonna take my new glasses and go Music you,165.28301886792454,conspiratorial,4.0,1.0,EbR3muQJ66I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbR3muQJ66I
"$2 MILLION in 12 months, the price of Mr. Beast's success",2019-03-27T17:31:36Z,24.333333333333332,9652975,313272,Music yo youre early man can we do something cool so its not just bland like a city Music alright time care yo if at any point in time this interview gets boring yeah point about me and keep it in your lap if you want theres still a small flame here you know so this is mr beast Jimmy yep mr beast has one of the biggest channels on all of YouTube I dont feel like it but I guess you know its kinda just like numbers on a screen your last video had 13 million views the video before that 14 million 11 million 11 million 15 million 15 million 21 million 14 million 24 million 18 million its been a while since I looked at this well I I dont know how to like I mean what do I say to that you know like yeah we get a lot of news you know I mean you should be proud so yeah per video overall like 2 billion nothing crazy cause like a year and a half ago I was kind of a nobody you know you just said 2 billion nothing great well Logan Paul has 5 billion so two billion is 30 percent of the worlds population okay yeah I guess one out of three human beings on the entirety of planet Earth describe to me like describe your channel describe your content yeah so that is where it gets complicated because as you saw not a single one of those videos were like even remotely like similar to the other ones so its usually just me being an idiot and thats about like the core part of it and then just spending lots of money and and lots of time and just doing whatever honestly its impossible like what it you know you read the dictionary for eight straight hours you spun a fidget spinner for 24 straight hours twice yeah you watched cult drive this hour that was thats the peak with human evolution what Im gonna be doing is Im gonna be painting this board and Im gonna watch it dry yeah said PewDiePie over and over and over a hundred thousand times PewDiePie PewDiePie PewDiePie PewDiePie PewDiePie PewDiePie feed by PewDiePie PewDiePie yeah you spent 24 hours underwater you said Logan Paul a hundred thousand times how many hours straight did you watch its every day brother hours 10 hours of watching when I went to bed that night it was playing in my head too like I had to listen to other music so I just stopped hearing its every day bro like literally that entire night it just kept going in my head you counted to a hundred thousand to you forty hours like forty four yeah okay so forty four hours of counting was one two three four five if you watch the video back you can slowly see you like my soul leave my body youre losing your mind yeah thousand two hundred seven thousand one eighty seven thousand to two eighty seven thousand two or three seven thousand to a forty seven thousand you dont feel like youre going crazy when youre well back I mean that was a different time that was the hardest one and I was like I mean I just really wanted it you know I wasnt I dropped out of college I wasnt really making much so I was like you know I knew it would go viral and I just kind of had to like just put in the hours you know well okay lets talk about that see youre youre 20 now but you starting your YouTube channel and youre 12 yes on an older channel deleted it than I in the first a hundred couple hundred videos on your channel now yeah are just kind of like a Minecraft and just random things yeah it was basically yeah I remember thinking like everyday back then like Im never gonna be a youtuber but I really want to be a youtuber and it just like after like year after year after year after year after year after year like literally it just like this is never gonna happen but Im still gonna try and you know what I mean it just I just remember like every night feel like is it ever gonna happen you know youre making no money you had very little audience yeah but you still stuck with it and the first I think like your first video that broke a million last one that seemed foreshadowing like you made a thousand videos of Minecraft and a thousand experimental videos none really found traction and then you did this one that was a little bit about your personality a lot about a stunt and well part of it too is I literally didnt even have a camera back then like I had a terrible laptop because I used to make 1 a day and I didnt even have a microphone side to save up for months to buy a microphone so thats why my first videos were literally recorded with the built in like microphone on my laptop and then I got a microphone then I got a computer and then I got an iPhone which then cuz I had a Windows Phone which only recorded like 480 I couldnt record with that so once I got an iPhone after a years of like all this stuff then I started recording myself and I moved a little bit away from gaming and then I was able to buy a camera and but I got like 200 000 subscribers with like an iPhone 5 recording in 30fps 720p you hear that and yeah and thats why I like I tell people all the time start a channel like I cant afford it and they have like literally like the new iPhone and people used to always complain about the quality and I was like ok well I cant do anything I need my next paycheck to buy something the first to a million was this stunt about you and then the first to 10 million had to do with money ok paying with money in a way that I dont think anybody on YouTube or in any sensible human being on planet earth had ever done before yeah was that an aha what do you mean like how did why did I do it early no I think I can understand why you did it its interesting when you put that out there and you saw that it people went nuts over it were you like theres something to this ah I dont know I think I my mind set if you want to know how I always thought I just always saw it as I just reinvest everything I make like literally up till a few months ago every time I got a paycheck that was just like the months budget so like like I saved up a dollar a day to buy a microphone when I have made a few thousand dollars I just spent a few thousand dollars when I made 10 000 I just spent 10 so its like as I made more money Ill just like alright well no I want to spend it on video somehow that was just my mindset if thats what youre asking I guess what Im asking is I feel like if I were to ask a hundred people who aspire to be youtubers yeah what they would do detect with 10 dollars to help them get to success I imagine it would say things like I want to travel more I want to get better cameras yeah I dont imagine any aspiring filmmaker saying if someone gave me 10 000 Id give it to a pizza delivery man yeah or a homeless person was the first one I did yeah my first ever brand deal they offered me five grand and I said double it and Ill go give it to homeless person and they thought I was lying and then I just they gave it to me and I just walked outside and give it away well Im a youtuber I mean you can see the camera so Im just so serious when I just you know be nice and just give people some help so if you want to take it its about ten thousand dollars how much of that is you know philanthropy how much of that is you wanting to help somebody and how much of that is using your opportunity yeah I like helping people Ive always like even when I you know didnt have much money if I have money my wallet I just give it away so I call most people on stuff which sounds fake I dont know how to prove it to people but I will say my overarching goal in life is to make a lot of money and then before I die give it away its what I want to do save that no lets talk about money okay yeah no I I really do like helping people like I dont I dont have a mansion or a nice car or anything like that I just Id rather spend it doing things like that your channel description says do not email me asking for money you will be blocked and ignored yeah and that is because I need to be able to read brand emails and stuff like that you know what I mean its not because I dont want to help you and thats funny because some of your biggest video hits go like this 10 000 to a homeless man 1 000 to random strangers 10 000 to twitch streamers 10 000 to pizza delivery guy 10 000 to Nuvo driver 100 000 to your mom dropping 20 000 from a drone Ive done yet 20 000 tip to a waitress Elena Custer was waitressing at a family restaurant in North Carolina when two customers came in and ordered something pretty basic a glass of water when I went over there they were gone and theres a note on the table on a napkin and said waters were great and just the stack of hundreds sitting there and I was like oh my gosh so whos the mystery 10 000 tipper his name is Jimmy Donaldson and on YouTube he goes by the name mr beast I guess the question is like what is it about giving away yeah yeah why do I do it yeah yeah its fun like when you give someone so much money that its like what they make in a year and youre just like throw it at him and see how they react its just its so much fun to me I dont know I mean I dont know how to put it like I you you tell people you know when you just give them stuff like that that they were just not expecting and you see their face light up and and Ive had people a lot of its off camera but like come back the next day and be like you know because of you I can take a day off every week and stay with my daughter and things like that it just its fun and that does matter to you yeah of course why do you think those videos do so well on YouTube um well theres a big misconception that controversy and negativity is the only way to get clicks because like thats how it is a media for the most part like they they dont want good stories they just want bad things but I think on YouTube is different and people just never realized it like positivity is just as clickbait as a negativity can you talk me through like your formula okay a video for from ideation yeah well see this is where it gets messy because theyre all different I need you to pick a video that make it a little easier me last person I made a video what everybody I put their hand on a Lamborghini yeah yeah last person to take their hand off the Lamborghini we got an older one which they didnt end up wanting so we just gave him 20 grand the last person take their hand off the Lamborghini got the Lamborghini yeah you dont need to downplay thats yeah okay so like where does last person to step outside of our circle you arbitrarily grab 100 grand like yeah where are these ideas come from and I mean theres theres all sorts of things like cuz before you start a video like that is it like whats gonna get the most views or is it what am I almost interested in these are hard questions its mostly what what do people want to see you know like its like if it gets views for the most part right because people its people click on it and like I want I want to give people what they want you know what I mean I think so oh okay well I I what I wrote I was like how do you know and I think this is your like this is your mastery this is what you do that anyone else and this is why you have two billion views and 17 million but its not all about the idea   its all about execution which like we try to all around be above the rest you know like I mean you anyone can clickbait but it you do you actually like deliver on it like we say we put a hundred million Orbeez in the backyard we put 100 million Orbeez in the backyard even if its like brutal I mean were talking like months now videos in the work but we deliver you know any me your titles and thumbnails I think are the most irresistible I get that a lot thank you I appreciate it so how much consideration goes into the thumbnail on the title even before you made the movie so like the way I like to look at it is if other people are spending one hour thinking of video ideas or whatever probably more like 30 minutes in like 5 hours filming I want to spend 10 hours thinking of ideas and days filming you know its not just spend more time ideas its like everything every time I ask you about your process mm hmm you talk about sort of like whats gonna get the most of use yeah yeah and I guess I want to understand like is that for you as a youtuber is that is that your mission is that why youre a youtuber is it abuse to get the views oh yeah youre asking deep questions well I mean theres theres a lot of factors to consider because I like we talked about before I have a lot of employees and then like my mom a lot a lot of people depend on me so I I have to keep the revenue coming and like I said I want to help people which that sounds fake but you know I want to make money so later on in life I can do big things so like a lot of that is correlated with views but like theres so many misconceptions that we have to dive into because people think just because you go for views means you cant have fun but you can pull views and you can have fun which is what we purposely try to do so like I dont think necessarily if Im helping people Im not being too misleading I mean some things are a little fluff and like you know were having fun and stuff being ethical I dont I dont see any issue with going for views now that youre implying that but like lots of people dont realize all those factors you know was that the motivation to start being a youtuber abuse I mean you I mean just everything what I I mean I I didnt even make money the first two years of whatever so I mean looking into your old videos like its clear you didnt make any money for the first six years so I just loved being a youtuber cuz like back then I was not passionate about hardly like anything it was just like I enjoyed it and it was just what I wanted more than anything like even if I even if I had ten thousand subscribers to this day Id still be making videos thats clear I havent got that for a second um but I want to know more about the the motivation but I feel like motivation isnt like you can be motivated by more than one thing Im motivating someone to support my mom and my family Im motivated because I want to employ my friends and help them I motivate cuz I want to help other people Im motivated cuz I want to be a youtuber I want to be I mean I feel like thats another misconception you can have lots of things that drive you yeah absolutely yeah absolutely theres just tons of stuff that drive me and everything drives me to wanting to be a youtuber so it kind of obsess over it I think that it requires I think finding success on YouTube requires that kind of motivation when that kind of ambition has to be fueled by all those factors not just wanting to be famous and have clout yeah I mean I think it has to be something substantive and real because its easy to look at a mr beast and be like this guy does 20 million views a video but its much harder to look at mr beast in 2015 yeah whos uploaded a thousand videos and youre making 30 I remember Im like I said before so many years now just like I mean everyone that like knew me and knew I put all my time into its like is it ever gonna work out are you sure you should spend this much time doing it even my mom I get everyone its like after some point its just like you feel like you should quit but you want it so badly you just keep going its not an inspiring story until you succeeded exactly I know and so many people say they want to do what I do but its like do you really cuz I literally gave up my entire teenage years before I was 13 till after I was 19 my whole teenage years were grinding on YouTube and then other people grind for a year or two years or even three years and then they dont make it and they complain and its like I mean youre just kind of scratching the surface you know like you got to put in more hours calling all Bros you can save YouTube subscribe to PewDiePie there it is again look at look at this this is the busiest street in the world hes just like hey guys hows it going what is your relationship with Felix with PewDiePie oh thats a fun one I talked to my Twitter diems thats about as far as weve gotten but I guess Ramayana is like what youve done some crazy things for him yeah for Felix you did billboard but lets not act like I didnt get stuff in return thats why Im doing this so lets run down the list you did you Bob or full size billboards that said subscribe to the video I said his name a hundred thousand times said his name 100 000 is PewDiePie yeah okay good Im glad you brought this up I used to make videos on PewDiePie like before he was even number one and lay back in the day and you went to the Super Bowl yeah so you could get Applause we have literally just tweeted like an idea like that is expensive and difficult to realize do you do that because you know its gonna be great content or do you do that out of like a blind Robin loyalty to Felix no obviously great content like if I was doing things out of blind well its hard because I want to help PewDiePie so the video has to go viral though to help them so its kind of like those coincide like I like PewDiePie but like I need a good video so peopIe gets the most promotion you soon Im saying like if the video doesnt get 20 million views he doesnt gain a lot of subscribers have you have you    up yet on YouTube no I havent i Ive had like maybe like one bad video made on me just like nothing really I feel like I feel like at some point Im gonna like slip up do something on accident and then like people are gonna turn on me so you havent you havent had to make an apology dude you know I mean okay in 2015 you made a video called dear future me oh boy yeah yeah I did lots of them you got this is your first one yeah whats up me now I know youre gonna forget about this video it is currently October 4th 2015 it will be 2017 when you see this yeah Im gonna schedule this video for two years in the future so um in two years I hope you have at least 100k subs if you dont have a hundred K subs I am why make a video like that I thought it was pretty cool I thought it was creative honestly I I agree yeah and thats what I try to do is just creative things because thats like its its you know obviously thats how you get more views because its not been done before but I saw some more intriguing and it builds more engaged fan base and things like that it also shows you at a time before all this that we had a good idea ya know when youre vulnerable and youre you know youre small you were struggling youtuber and you still had sort of the conviction to make these these guesses these are the prophecies of where youre gonna be in the future yeah and the reality of those those guesses was so far off yeah like you you were being totally earnest and you were saying right now I have this many subscribers and if I work hard I know in six months I can have this many sometimes and the reality was in six months you had this   yeah I do remember   my mom used to always tell me I like to stop making videos and go study and things like that all the time I know right I know she works anytime you want to do something theres no paved yeah you know if you want to be a car mechanic and you were you know your first job is that like Jiffy Lube as an intern you made minimum wage your mom wouldnt be like stop wasting your time if youd be like well youre on your way to becoming in the can yeah youre making an honest living respect that I think something people dont know about you is your history with Crohns disease yes I dont its not like I dont mind talking about it its just what does what does Crohns disease yeah its an inflammatory bowel disease its just more like how does it actually Ive really never talked about it publicly I dont even know Ive never even had anyone asked me about it publicly no no its just uh how does it how does it youre 20 years old how do you affect your well its not as bad now its just like I used to be extremely sick back when I used to    I dont know thats a lot theres a lot of story to that I dont know if we want to deep dive into that I like I just get medicine a lot and eat healthy and Im pretty low on energy which Im better Im not fake so like just why in my videos Im just not super high energy like other people but its just like thats a product of crows a little bit of it yeah its low energy not as enthusiastic things like that yeah theres a lot to that but I think we probably just say that for a different time no no you can like I dont mind cuz like if someone watching this has Crohns it might be inspiring so I dont mind its just I dont I dont even really know all the ins and outs of Crohns Im trying to get a class from a gastroenterologist to learn more its like I feel kind of weird talking about something when Im not even really fully educated on it I just know like inflamed its a disease in my small intestine or something I I dig your videos thank you but I think the most impressive thing about I think the most impressive thing about weve done YouTube has been your less persistence thank you which weve gone over a lot in this video which I appreciate cuz like like most people dont you know and they just like would just be like so you give away lots of money cool you know well I I dont think that theres enough emphasis put on that in the creator community I think that you know the the people that get the most views are the most successful its just the way it works if youre the most successful it means typically you have some notoriety you have a you make a shitload of money and thats what aspiring creators look at they look at these people up on their pedestals and theyre like fantastic thats what I want but they dont pay attention you get there yeah and so I mean its just literally I mean every day of the course of years every dollar you make put it back into it like obsess over it like thats thats your advice for aspiring true yes like I mean like go all in and like the biggest thing is if if everyones ideas are like well like if everyones putting a few hours into their videos youre putting a few days if like everything go above and beyond make sure youre nothing like anyone else like youll get notice but its I mean its gonna take forever its gonna take a lot of your thought you know thinking time and stuff and how much money have you given away over the course I dont know I know yeah I dont know I mean its nothing crazy though its like its not even its probably not even 2 million yet but like I said like the amount Ive spent is pretty high because I said were not talking about video production here Im talking about literally you handing people stacks a line   yeah yeah I dont for more of the recent ones its usually I hand them fake money and then off camera write him a check yeah yeah did you ever did you ever think youd be as successful as you are right now it depends when you ask me like once I started to like blow up I did but like I mean if you ask me five years ago no obviously not if you and I are making a video right now its called dear mr Bies yeah and you were talking to yourself 10 years in the future what would you what would I say to myself 10 years of future where do you think youll be ten years from now where I think out well Im kind of ignorant on a lot of things like Im 20 I dont I dont no I dont know what I what I truly want to do but were now I know what I truly want to do if I dont know like I dont know you know itd be like I dont know what content is gonna be but you you think youll be a youtube yeah 100 100 Im into making videos literally until YouTubes not a thing last question yeah you have to forgive me some a dad all right hit me this is a dad question yeah are you saving any of your money yeah of course like like I said now I am I you you say of course you just told me you gave away two million dollars well like last choice its funny explain actually we spent millions of dollars on videos is crazy its a miracle I didnt go broke cuz I but uh yeah now I am like which is why if you had this conversation with me a year ago Ive been like no I have no money but now I do yeah Im fine okay yeah Im gonna the desert is there before you in this interview is there anything else youd like to say to my demise subscribe well this was a lot about me I I loved your blogs back me dated a lot like I watch them every day big inspiration I appreciate that Jimmy thanks for coming

Goodbye Social Media.,2019-03-13T16:14:26Z,9.133333333333333,2669254,86350,thank you very much shall we swing a little bit bye honey bye not so close the honey this this guy right here right right here thats Jacob Jacob lamendola Jacobs a filmmaker remember how I said I was doing a long form project and thats why I havent been posting videos okay that long form movie that Im making Jacob is helping me edit it Im working on it though dont well things are good okay I I have a problem ah its serious no this is not a joke I have a bonafide like proper no sarcasm but proper addiction to social media let me just qualify what that means I used the word addiction by the way very lightly I have friends who have struggled with chemical addictions its not that maybe a better maybe a better descriptor or for it would be to call it a destructive habit because it has a negative impact on my life okay but what it looks like is this I cant have a conversation I cant sit through a movie I cant hang out in real life with friends I cant make it through dinner I cant make it through a conversation I cant drive my car more than a couple of blocks very dangerous without thumbing through social media and this isnt some like things I justify is like its for work or I need to know its this is mindless scroll with this is that thing you do on Twitter that thing you do on Instagram theres nothing behind it theres no benefit theres no upside just scrolling I carry two phones two phones at all times all day every day I carry an iPhone then whatever the latest and greatest Android bonus if youve ever met me like most people this is what it looks like average 59 minutes is one hour a day on Instagram 47 minutes a day on Twitter thats an hour and 46 minutes a day just between Twitter and Instagram a significant amount of my day is spent on that mindless scrolling thats just the part thats just how much of my life I lose when it comes to time forget about like the health implications of it you know Im not a super insecure guy but when Im thumbing through Instagram like its almost an involuntary human emotion or human reaction to be comparing yourself or your life with other peoples lives and then like Im not a particularly politically active person but what Im thumbing through Twitter I follow a lot of news outlets and like I see that Donald Trump called Tim Cook Tim Apple which is funny and I laugh at it and I scroll down like somebody on this side is mad at Trump for saying that and somebody on this side is saying no its just a joke then theres this arguing and then Im getting stressed out over something that I had no bearing on my life and I I think I like justify it as with the Twitter thing like I need to know whats going on its a healthy thing to know whats going on no one needs to know whats going on in that level and Instagram I can similarly justify it as like this is just fun its a great way to pass time but the reality is an hour a day looking at pictures like theres theres just no way that thats making me a better person or a better father or better anything thats just like burning time looking at other peoples lives like doing to our brains that what is it doing to our brains bit I think is well nobody knows see social media is not that old its like whatever 10 15 years old and then having these super powerful smartphones in our pocket that give us unfettered access to social media thats new it hasnt been around long enough for anybody to actually know what the impact like the long term impact of it is little story when Georgina was born Georgina is my little baby girl not my not my four year old but the little one when she was born I I dont know I like told myself I wanted a wheat whereas just meat appreciating the fact that I had this new beautiful baby dog I didnt put on any social media because I wanted to make sure that I was appreciating you know having a new daughter not that I was seeking anybodys approval because of likes or retweets or anything like that so I took a week seven full days without checking Twitter ones without checking Instagram ones and I mean its hard to articulate the impact it had on me but it was like like I wasnt happier but it did feel like almost a burden was lifted off of me like a weight like a heavy blanket that I sold her every day it wasnt there so my brain could focus on fewer things my brain had to focus on fewer things so I could appreciate like the things that are amazing about life instead of thinking about all of this noise that is consuming 59 minutes or 47 minutes or whatever it is a Twitter a day all right so I I did a little research whenever I say I do research that means I just googled it but I did a little research and Kevin ruse and its in the New York Times and the title of the article is do not disturb how I ditched my phone and unbroke my brain tell me how familiar this sounds I found myself incapable of reading books watching full length movies for having long uninterrupted conversations social media made me angry and anxious mmm okay another really fascinating article its called the NBAs happiness crisis and its about how a lot of NBA stars feel isolated I mean these are like the best athletes in the world that are very well paid how theyre feeling isolated and they have a kind of anxiety that professional athletes didnt used to have it ends with this the bottom line rampant social media usage is a problem that extends far beyond sports and examining the impact its having on professional athletes really opens your eyes to the magnitude of the problem okay so heres what Im gonna do heres my this is a short term solution but heres Im gonna do I am officially deleting Twitter and Instagram off of both of my phones Im keeping my accounts and by not having it on my phones it means Im not gonna be able to check it all day long if theres something I need to read about something I want to share Ill write it down in my notes app Ill take a picture and leave it on my phone when I get home later Ill share it if it I deem it worthy but from now on or at least until I cant stand it anymore Im only gonna be checking social media when I sit down at home in front of my laptop spend far less time a day in front of my laptop then I do with with one of these two devices in my hands Music I feel like there was a point in my life when I was very good at packing light and then Ive gotten away from that and now I dont know how to pack light anymore Music oh my goodness Freddie help daddy pack all my stuff up Francini I dont think youre gonna be able to come on this trip honey ah JFK Terminal five thank you thank you shall we swing a little bit back at the airport again Music Applause so its now now 830 which means its been five hours since I deleted the apps from my phone I feel good I still catch myself checking the phone like every 20 seconds but then theres nothing down there to look at so I put it back in my pocket Im so far so good Music,149.67153284671534,uninterrupted,0.0,1.0,6DfP10OeDP0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DfP10OeDP0
im a lifeguard now.,2019-03-04T13:28:58Z,11.283333333333333,2062569,66350,Music behind that red door lies my studio Music studio for the better part of two thousand thirteen to nineteen years somewhere between fifteen and sixteen years every single square inch of every wall and floor and ceiling of this studio tells a story these Dominos for example remember that video I made a few years ago about the hours in my day I made them with these everywhere in this space is a story every single one of these pictures and posters and drawings and everything on the wall its a prop from one of my movies those were the original poster ideas from my HBO show from 2010 so why am i bringing this up now well Ive been in New York City for 18 years and the truth is my days here are numbered Ive been talking about it forever but the family were inching closer to leaving the city once and for all and as I think about that Im struggling to figure out how to say goodbye to this space without having to say goodbye to all of the stories and all the history in this space kind of a psychopath has camera battery chargers like that theres a story there see this wall it used to look like this in this part of the studio used to look like this and this Music Applause so I have this idea came up with this idea I think its a great idea here goes why dont I make a book about this studio and when I say book I dont mean a book like this I dont mean a book thats you know words Im in a book like this this is one of my favorites a book thats mostly pictures honestly why do I even have this Justin Biebers book a book thats mostly pictures and along with the pictures are little tiny stories that give context to the photos picture like a hardcover like a coffee table book about the history like the 13 year history of my studio because I have all the documentation and photos that go all the way back that tell the whole history of this space it wouldnt just be a story of the physical space but of the people to like way back like we used to have these contests where we see how far we and jump off of those rings Music we dismantled it because we didnt want to get sued but I used to have a half pipe in here also used to have like this heavy knotted rope that we tied to the ceiling and so Im not Im not a hundred percent on how to get a book made so I called like I called my agent and I said I want to make this book and he said we have to go to publishers and pitch the idea that sounds horrible dont know not comfortable with that he said put together a video of the idea and we can use that that kind of made sense but you know phone to make a video I got to put it on YouTube this video is meant to be a pitch video for book publishers you get what Im saying with the idea though right like a like a like a fancy like thirty dollar hardcover book that you like somebody buys for you as a gift or you buy for somebody as a gift and its like up youre not like I sit down in a novel but like wow like oh oh make a great book right Music I hope you can see the potential of my coffee table book idea if youre a book publisher you think this is a good idea Hall Ben Davis at WME and tell him hey Ben we would like to make Caseys coffee table book alright thanks a lot this is snow this is snokes its freezing free freezing cold out in New York City Im gonna do a throwback back to warmer better times reduction here I think we doing that max first shot the first shot is an homage to my vlog so give me the time lapse and then Kevin is on the phone is gonna step in can I reveal all this or is it Jim would have a giveaway last August I was in Los Angeles to shoot an episode of Kevin Harts like Fitness YouTube show called what the fit yeah Music Kevin Hart here shooting my show what the fit know what is with the fit I tell you what the fit is what the finish the show where I include myself my celebrity friends and we do a bunch of physical fit activities so they have no idea that were gonna do and today today I got my guy kV nice chat with me Casey say hey there you go it was an awesome day a lot of fun it was like I was just cool its cool being around Kevin it was cool being around a big production like that I shot a vlog about the whole day and then I came home and the next morning I got a phone call from the producers and they were like hey totally cool if you want to make a vlog about this shoot but please dont release it until after the episode comes out so the episode came out yesterday and I thought I could maybe lean into this footage a little bit weve got lifeguard history granted I got fired cuz I let a kid drowned thats a long story you didnt die he did not die together the comedian when he said I used to be a lifeguard and toy I fired because someone almost drowned I thought that was a joke but he just kept saying it and then he eventually told me the story and its totally true nobody died but when he was on like patrol he was like a teenager someone actually like like badness happened when the other lifeguards rescued that person and he was literally fired from being a lifeguard that was the truth appreciate the story glad nobody got hurt change spray on the lake here hey were not microphone all right Casey here we go on three one two three wrap that around your shoulder no no hes gonna trip okay what you dont see in that moment when I jumped in the water is that I lost my hat and I found my hat but I also lost my glasses and in the next couple of scenes I dont have on glasses no glasses can do some beast patrolling oh does this car have like a loudspeaker like a PA system and what had happened was like they were going into the ocean and I was kinda like uh and I just gave up on it I remember like one of the producers being like are we gonna shoot the rest of the show now you dont have glasses not a big deal just do without glasses and then like youll notice Im in the car and all sudden I should have ate so while were shooting that funny scene in the truck which is like 30 seconds in the video but we were in that truck for like an hour and a half one of the lifeguards pretty sure is one of the lifeguards comes running over the truck and is like Casey I found your glasses and the dude I guess way around in the ocean for a while and he actually recovered my glasses can you see those scratches thats from when these were swimming in the bottom of the ocean thats not correct so the whole car scene like were in the car and then all of a sudden were at the end of the pier so in the video its like you know its like instant the reality of that is that we had to drive from the beach up onto the pier which wasnt that far but Kevin was screaming on the loudspeaker the entire time and like you forget how famous this guy is and the whole car was mobbed by people great lets go Casey wheres my guy and they were just crowds like thronged in throngs of people and if you look if you look you can see all the spectators right as Kevin jumps off the end Music aside was it was a super fun day it was really fun experience for me I think the biggest takeaway that whole day for me was when I watched this episode Becks was 15 minutes for the what the fit episode it really kind of feels like a seamless like make easy piece of cake shoot when in reality like the behind the scenes of this there was a crew of well over a hundred people on that like major cameramen everywhere still photographers look at this look at this camera cluster here I forget because they spend so much time on YouTube I forget what goes into like an actual real production like that alright check it out Im gonna link that below Kevin and what the pit crew thank you for having me check it out you better cover your brush up thatsa gets a guy yeah see the youre right absolutely right Captain Smith from the lifeguard squad his son gave me this hat thank you very much guys it was a pleasure working with

Being RICH vs Being POOR - a video essay,2019-02-26T21:34:09Z,10.216666666666667,3488914,127084,Music burgers for breakfast burgers for breakfast burger for back to 32 pac 10 burgers burgers for breakfast will be in a lot you know the man the myth yeah look at this production hey guys how much am I allowed to talk about what were doing here in my own video yeah nothing were doing here is a big secret okay okay great yeah burgers for breakfast all right okay so what Im doing here is you know hot ones from first we feast will they have another so called the burger show thats hosted by Alvin here Alvins like pretty much a big or the biggest deal chef there is oh my started a restaurant called eggslut yeah excellent Venice la Vegas you name it when did this come out when does this episodes about April April tune in on April 9th online first we feast YouTube channel gaming are you gonna finish that I dont think so I never took Mike Music so on Sunday or something like that I found this fantastic article in The New York Times and the headline reads wealthy successful and miserable the upper echelon is hoarding money and privileged to a degree not seen in decades but that doesnt make them happy at work it is a very very interesting story article its about its about a lot of things but that they focus on like this one character that the journalist met at a reunion and this guy is miserable he he is like a Harvard Business School type who works in a hedge fund or something and this guy makes this is the subject of this story this guy makes 12 million dollars a year but the story is about how he is miserable at work it was insanely stressful work done among people he didnt particularly like he earned about 12 million dollars a year and he hated going into the office I feel like Im wasting my life away he told me when I die is anyone gonna care that I earned an extra percentage point of return my work feels totally meaningless and the story goes on theres one partner I really like where they talk about these janitor like someone who mops floors and cleans out like bedpans that people pee in janitor in a hospital and how that janitor did find fulfillment and happiness in their job because they felt like they had a purpose like there was a greater good I thought that I think thats a very interesting ok so I tweeted this article and there was kind of a lot of feedback in my Twitter thread I think its from people who just read the headline but a lot of like really valid feedback that was like Oh boohoo poor millionaire is not happy that was the sentiment and I appreciate that and I was thinking a lot about that I was thinking about like that that platitude money wont solve your problems and money wont solve all your problems what a crawfish and I think I do have like a unique perspective on this because you know I spent a good part of my life being very very poor I qualified very poor as like zero in my bank account zero savings zero safety net no one I could turn to for money and you know there was definitely a time in my life when my my son Owen was very small where if I didnt get free diapers and milk and money from the government Im not sure I could have made made ends meet as a as a parent or as an individual so when I say there was a time in my life when I was poor thats what it meant thats kind of that was me then thats what my life looked like then this is an apartment that I was very lucky to have this is an apartment that I lived in with my kiddo and rent was 400 bucks a month lucky to have it no complaints but that was any of it and for the last decade Ive had a lot of means like I make you know I make good money now you guys see the absurd life that I get to live Im very lucky so why does that ID that money wont solve your problems why does that idea why did that bother me so much when I was when I was struggling in life why did so many people on Twitter get so upset by misinterpreting this headline and the answer is that for most people who are broke money will literally solve every one of your problems money will solve your problems this idea that money wont solve problems is bullsh when I was dirt poor money would have solved every one of my problems I was lucky not to have health issues or other you get the idea money wouldve solve all my problems and I think thats why people respond to just this headline with such emotion is because its like it feels so tone deaf when you have nothing to hear this idea that money wont solve your problems I thought about it further okay ready rich or poor we all face these problems problems that all call life problems life problems are things like finding happiness and finding love and a sense of fulfillment in your life and a sense of purpose maybe in your career etc these are life problems these are problems we all rich or poor encounter money wont solve these problems but when youre broke on top of and I mean that literally and figuratively on top of these problems youve got money problems and money problems or things like how am I gonna pay rent how am I gonna pay for food Im sick in cant afford go to the doctor I cant get a job so I cant drive to work Im have any nice clothes to wear that job interview it things like that and I think the hardest part of money problems is that when you have money problems they can drown out these other issues like if youre feeling down in life its hard to work on your happiness when you literally might not know where youre gonna sleep its hard to like dwell too much on a relationship when you literally dont know where your next meal might come from and youre not exactly worried about fulfillment at your job when you have no way to get there and you got no clothes to wear and you get the idea I go even further with this and say that these life problems rich or poor we all kind of try to solve them the same way and theyre very hard to solve whats the answer to finding happiness in life I dont know it takes a lot of work takes a lifetime to find happiness or love or a sense of fulfillment but when youre facing these problems the solutions right in front of you money money solves all of these problems and I think that makes these kinds of problems much harder to face because and the solution is just out of reach like in Indiana Jones when hes trying to last crusade and trying to reach for the cuff like Music so with that if you are struggling financially and someone tells you money wont solve all of your problems chances are the person saying that is someone whos never actually been broke and then the story itself ends and this is this is written from the perspective of the journalist because a journalist knew this guy who made the 12 million dollars finding meaning whether its as a banker or a janitor is difficult work usually life rather than a business school classroom is the place to learn how to do it that really hit home for me I think the conclusion that this journalist made is not far off from what Tony Hawk said when he was on Kodama is doing what you love and its not the most financially successful thing it doesnt matter because youll love going to work every day and the ultimate the ultimat is when you find a job that does pay you enough to cover your bills a job that a job that does satiate all of these all of these kind of basic needs so you can spend your life actually focusing on things like being happy and finding love and making sure youre getting that fulfillment and sense of purpose sense of purpose at work okay give the article read its its wonderful Music Im happy to share with you that well one Im sorry I havent been posting but Im happy to share with you that the reason why I havent been posting is that Im working on something Im working something I wanted to do for a while which is like a really long form probably an hour maybe even longer movie for this YouTube channel its not like a branded thing Im not doing it for anybody but myself but it is something Ive been thinking about for a while and two weeks ago I was like screw it lets do it and Ive devoted all of my energy and focus to making something that I think I hope would be really meaningful for my channel so if my schedule is even more irregular than usual its because I am trying to do something Im trying to do something new and big if you dont follow me on Twitter you probably missed that I got a 275 ticket last week for running a red light on my boosted board so I now stop at red lights and Im much more cautious again NYPD I apologize and I have since paid the fine Music,162.8711256117455,misinterpreting,0.0,1.0,ROfBLx6bLZI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROfBLx6bLZI

BURGER KiNG Fights back (this is not an ad),2019-02-02T15:23:26Z,5.666666666666667,3102398,122510,ding fries eaten ding president ding president ding fries eaten I gotta run I gotta run I gotta run I gotta run it was just it was just like a polar vortex in New York City today so a little bit chilly outside all right so for those of you who are new around here earlier this week I put out a video and it was a tongue in cheek commentary videos a joke ironic meant to be funny commentary video about this brilliant social media campaign that Burger King did wherein they would go and like influencers old tweets from like 8 years ago in any event my video was sort of me pretending to be upset at Burger King because they used me unsuspectingly as part of their marketing I thought it was brilliant I made the video I still think its brilliant Burger King but not everyone got the joke I mean Im pretty sure every person whos a youtube subscriber every person that commented and every person on Twitter got that it was a joke but influencer Casey Neistat rips Burger King for exploiting him was Burger King wrong to trick influencers into promoting its foudre King just exploited a ton of influencers to build brand awareness but one of them hit back harder Burger King under fire for exploiting influencers in marketing stunt YouTube influencer Casey and I spent feuds with Burger King after prank so you know didnt take that seriously Burger King so they followed me on Twitter and they tweeted at me and said hey follow us I followed them and i DM them and I said hey hope youre not mad at me and they werent they were psyched to talk so this morning I get on a call with them I dont know who Im talking to I assume that its gonna be like you know like their social media marketing team or something like that is it not its their CMO that is their chief marketing officer their global chief marketing officer ok Im on the phone the CMO totally cool guy he tells me hes like sitting on the side of the road talking to me on his self and were chitchat he thought the whole thing was funny which I appreciate cuz well I appreciate even went out of his way to mention that he liked the part Roz eating a Burger King whopper a Burger King cheeseburger out of the garbage can I was eating out of the garbage hammocks I threw it away but I didnt like I didnt want to waste it so I I put a clean garbage bag in there at it in any event he appreciated that in the original video I said I had unwittingly done like marketing or promotion for Burger King and I thought there was some value in that so maybe they wanted to make this situation right by making a donation to one of my favorite charities charities that that help kids with with meats or underprivileged kids or sick kids and in any event I said that next kind of meant that but but I wasnt sure if you would or anyone would take that seriously they did and this is what he this is what he proposed to me let me just clarify   Im not working for Burger King Ive never worked for Burger King Im not now getting paid by Burger King and I definitely wasnt paid by Burger King both ways Ive never taken money from Burger King what he said is Casey we want to make a donation to the two charities that you mentioned the Boys and Girls Club and the make a wish Foundation and hes and Birkins gonna donate to each of those organizations 25 000 25 000 Club to help kids who dont have anything to do after school or maybe need some leadership in their life 25 000 bucks you or the make a wish Foundation which takes children that are very very sick and grants them any wish in the world good for you Burger King and before the cynics out there say that theyre just doing that for good press they specifically said to me they have no intention of publicizing these two donations and they also had no expectation of me publicizing that theyre making these donations but I mean of course Im you know whatever Im not a cynic I like to assume the best in people regardless they are making these donations as wonderful and then I said to them you know I said to him that I thought it was absurd that there was like all this weird negative but then everybody on Twitter and everybody on YouTube was like defending it is just the joke that it was and I was like look can we show a little bit of love to like my audience so he said additionally Burger King would be happy to offer 2 000 free whopper meals to your fans were in the process of figuring out the details of how to fulfill like gift cards blah blah blah whatever Ill link it below when they get me the information so thats that thats it I just want to share that with you guys again I dont know much about Burger King I definitely dont know anything about them before making that joke video two days ago in getting to know them I appreciate their open mindedness and their candor with this I appreciate that they got the joke that so many others I appreciate it I asked you to hold the pickles and lettuce I know I get that fast but what I get to hear you saying no sir no youd get here I think girls Music all

The Lillian Vernon Story,2019-01-28T20:34:14Z,25.966666666666665,723958,31466,so yesterday was international Holocaust Remembrance Day and it felt like it feels like an appropriate time for me to share a story with you that Ive never shared and Im pretty sure has never been shared publicly and this is the story of one of my heroes an American businesswoman who escaped the Holocaust and the story is told in the form of a 20 minute documentary that almost no ones ever seen this is this is a documentary that my brother van and I made in Im pretty sure its 2003 so 15 16 years ago and the story of how we made it is we had met this woman her name is Lillian Vernon we have met her son and he explained to van and me that they were about to go on this this trip to explore his mothers like journey through Europe in in escaping the Holocaust and making the United States and they asked us to go with them and document it as best we could and thats exactly what we did and we didnt really know them personally we didnt know Lillian we didnt know her her kids very well and we certainly werent documentarians then and I at the time had made a bunch of short kind of internet movies but keep in mind this is like three years before YouTube so we like we packed up our video cameras and this is like DV video cameras this is way old school cameras and we followed Lillian and her two sons throughout Germany and Holland for almost two weeks and then then my brother edited together this documentary which to watch it now sixteen years later I think it holds up very well I think that we mostly van did a very good job making this movie so Im just gonna play it Im playing it as it was edited 16 years ago this is unlike most of the content I put on this channel but I hope you will appreciate it for what it is one last thing that I wanted to say before I click play Lillian Vernon the subject of this movie she passed away a little over three years ago and I was lucky enough to really get to know her in between us making this video about her 16 years ago and her passing and shes someone who had an outsized impact on me personally she showed me whats possible and she I think is defines embodies the idea that that you can do anything with enough hard work and perseverance okay so here is a 2003 movie by the nice tap brothers this is a 20 minute rough around the edges low res documentary about a great American hero and businesswoman Lillian Vernon I think you know Im a foreign born I was born in Leipzig Germany in 1927 and at the age of 6 we moved to Holland my forefathers saw that war was coming is trying to protect my older brother who was three years older than I I I was and hope to escape that a half century ago a newlywed looking for something to help make ends meet created a company right at her kitchen table today Lillian Vernon catalogs have made it to nearly every mailbox in America shes been a rich Music Music Music Music Music Music my story my story is a very simple one I was born into a Jewish family and they take you where they want to because thats what parents do thats really their job to take their children and protect their children and my family did that they left Germany and came to Holland and my children have asked me why Holland and I think Holland is the place my father did make yes but I am NOT   oh my mother lived here 65 years ago why did you see what it looked like in 1937 youre gonna be nice delusions this is my mother who lived here as a child yes please I do not speak without English updation look yes yes you can leave my sons yes I understand I didnt want to come home but I think it has changed yes everything changes this was the living room and this was the dining room and really is much different today different furniture different call us but this was the dining room right next to the kitchen mm hmm little garden on the outside Music whats it like being in here well I have to absorb all those emotional experiences to say whats like Music I dont know I dont know what it was like no whats it like right now right now a little painful romantic no pain I have a little problem confronting my past the last memory you have a robot leaving it you know when youre a kid you leave this place into ten years older youre nine years old and youre going for a new adventure youre going to America America mai chan todays segment is one of Americas most successful entrepreneurs she took casual wedding present in 1951 and turned it into a hundred and seventy million dollar catalog business it takes my breath away here to talk about how she did it is the founder and CEO of million burning catalogs Lillian Vernon thanks everyone now what happened how did you get started you you received a check for your wedding and you decide you what was it no in those days it was a lot of little checks not to make that money to God knows and I decided to go into business nobody would loan me money see chicken so I took my money and I went to was probably the black sheep of everything Ive ever done I went to work nobody went to work I made money nobody made money I remember going to a school that Fred teaches now a new school and a woman said she wants to do something I think she wanted to make some clothes and her husband wouldnt have her give her any money to start seed money so I said to her why dont you take your engagement ring which is sort of sizable and sell it oh she said to me that would make him very angry and I somebody wont give you money dont you then have to find a way to find your own source of money to do it and she said no I cant do that my husband would disapprove of that and I dont know if thats true today or not probably is true today and you know which is the different world a world I didnt live in Oh I chose to live it sold the jewelry in a moment in a second Vernon success was born out of a basic need she says and what I wanted is just to make another 50 a week that supplement our income would make it living a little better fifty years ago at her kitchen table a new bride and pregnant with her first of two sons she had an idea she placed her first ad in Seventeen magazine for a bag and shipped the orders I was pregnant with my Fred present the company now got him all out he meant the Basking had a baby extreme arrogance I back to work and it was just a huge hit I mean we spent five minute bucks I did thirty two thousand dollars worth of business when the ad was finished and its gonna be launched the original seed money for it was to go her fathers leather factory made the bag that she designed she added what would become a Lillian Vernon trademark monograms and the orders poured in Music we left true buddy was it after him with yes where it is now he had got the captain was that talked about at home heres some sensible I dont have much sense of that I think you talked about Oh dangerous it was for us but most of us you know what time is dinner and what are we having for dinner and how did you do in school I think all the ordinary things that every other family talks about but when your family made the decision yeah obviously a big decision of group leave everything you have any sense of how I was ever talked leave a child about up in that job spell I dont think if it was not our decision was up there and oh yeah what I mean was that you think well see Herman or her I think that was my father before my father had a singular singular thrust in his life is to protect his children Im not gonna say to protect his mail son but I think that was in his mind because of the army and the terrible consequence had he been drafted had Germany gone to war Im not even sure there was such a thought Holocaust Im not even sure the German mr that the Holocaust was coming things that we were leading up to the decision to go my brother was thrown down a flight of stairs and one of the buildings that we lived in and left his space raw and boss skin was there and that was because they it was Jewish and I think my father saw the handwriting on the wall but this will be the first of many many instances of violence against Jewish kids this is now 25 yeah but that was the help that would be a poppy building we moved into after we moved out of the villa which was taken over by this job they made that their base and I believe we lived on the second floor because they threw my brother down ah wouldnt talk managed Ron Klein this cant happen   is that telephone piece of their thoughts were in prices very very tests with the hospital for pedestrians Oh would you like to see that its got the phone books oh gosh Paul would see one hmm both Casa 63 mm hmm that was the original villa mm hmm well heres another harmony maybe I got my glasses so begins we align that you better buy them communication device absolutely does versus we out isnt it was his question sir theres a fish can you play ball he doesnt know how much he should charge it he doesnt have any I think you know I did it 100 euro on these steps again theres on these stairs that prejudice beaten up Lillian Vernon Janet speaking may help you the lean burn and Marie speaking may I help you good morning Lillian Vernon Linda speaking may I help you Music do you ever want to just cash in and call it a day no I really dont I like what I do I love what I do I love to shop I have a black belt in shopping and I like what I do so why should I cash in no mainly because youre so rich now I risk anything well life is risk cuz you know you get out of bed its a risk you know you could stay in bed and say oh good you know that I think lifes a risk and if you dont take it my goodness it passes you by all of our red white and blue is my god Bless America mugs t shirts with flags on caps with flags on have been blowing out of our place on our internet site our internet site so suddenly the the red white and blue and become very very popular we couldnt even buy flags I was like manufactured well the orders right up nobody had any money nobody was traveling it was terrible there what was cool about that scare in the mail anthrax so people wouldnt order I think had I realized that was 9 11 that made the business so tough Im not sure I would have sold but it was just really too tough for me and then maybe it was the right time to sell because I cant go on forever Lillian Vernon will be stepping down as CEO of the ride based catalog company that bears her name but the 74 year old businesswoman will remain as chairwoman a company spokesperson says Vernon will shift her focus towards promoting Lillian Vernon products and planning for the future of the business something that bothers me and you know itll probably always bother me its gone out of the family I mean how many people thought a business on the kitchen table grow it to a quarter of a billion dollars and then I just kind of sell it and be at the University of the people that buy it instead of really enjoying you know the rewards of all that one has done it is said my brother was a went to City College was a sophomore was drafted into the Army as all of our boys were and as soon as he went over he became an American citizen because you cant send him you cant send a foreigner overseas they can kill you as a spy in minutes but he died anyway so my father had left Germany got tahan left Holland looking for safety for my brother looking for safety for the whole family but basically they were very concerned about that male son and he died fighting the Germans were really having an incredible time I think this will bring us all closer together it really is just a very special visit just to meet these people and then buy his books and he didnt really want to sell him but he really said please take the money hes going on vacation I guess it made me feel that theyre good people it didnt matter to me if he got that 100 your we wanted to give it to we really really wanted to him have a better vacation because he gave us something thats important to us and didnt matter to him which he easily admitted and then you think of all the nonsense of things you buy and this is so good well it kind of throws it into perspective I was in Milan and I bought a fantastic jacket for about 8 000 absolutely repulsive it weighs 9 000 pounds on the property never wear it and I said Here I am what those books for 120 dollars and I will cherish them its just so amazing he didnt want he didnt care about me would have given it to us that was the interesting part this will change my life yes it has to change my life so Im very excited people just love is here bye bye how do you turn this thing off Music you Music itll be fine you gotta be

Burnt OUT YouTubers,2019-01-22T17:08:31Z,11.683333333333334,2270108,85872,the worlds biggest YouTube stars told us theyre burning out because of the unrelenting pressure to post new videos uh todays upload is a commentary video about this article that insider put out about youtuber mental health first I like that she she writes PewDiePie Casey Neistat and Alicia Marie have a combined YouTube following of well over a hundred million yeah take a look at this chart I put together here youll see that uh Alicia Marie and I arent really pulling our weight pewds coming in with 82 million here he really makes up the vast majority of the well over a hundred million subscribers but like I said flattering nonetheless ten I appreciate it burnout occurs when the reward for whatever we do is not equal or more than the effort we have to put in Kati Morton contributed this article by the way she is the woman that Shane Dawson worked with on the jake paul series when the reward for whatever we do is not equal or greater than the effort you put in i think this is true for a lot of creators especially creators that have kind of a very quick ascension to success even me i was on youtube for five years before i found success but I started daily vlogging in like within weeks my channel exploded and thats a really rewarding part of the process its exciting but like almost anybody maybe with the exception of PewDiePie almost anybody you do Plateau meaning the return you get is not as great even though the work youre putting in is the same thats why a lot of creators experience burnout after doing you know the same kind of content for an extended amount of time PewDiePie is YouTubes biggest star with a subscriber count of over 80 million in 2016 he went through a period of feeling too drained to maintain his jam packed schedule as an online content creator your presence needs to be constantly moving forward and since your job depends on it it can be hard to hit the brakes when youre blessed with many opportunities its hard to say no and you can easily find yourself with too many obligations to keep up ah Felix said that very very well when youre someone who who has a dream and ambition a goal and you achieve that goal on any level you feel this obligation to seize on every opportunity that comes your way and I think thats why why Felix to use this language when youre blessed with many opportunities every opportunity feels like a blessing when your audience shows up day in and day out on your YouTube channel all of that is an absolute blessing its an absolute luxury you like spend so much energy so much of your career seeking out and just just doing anything to find these opportunities and then you achieve them and theyre all coming at you at once theres this obligation the sense of obligation to say yes to all of them and ultimately it leads to what PewDiePie describes as you know too many obligations to keep up in in that effort to keep up you become overwhelmed and that and that sense of being overwhelmed manifests as as burnout morgan said the main signs of burnout are feeling tired and worn out about how much sleep you get being easily irritated and feeling like youre not successful hmm feeling like youre not successful the irony of achieving a level of success thats so overwhelming that it it leaves you feeling unsuccessful does that make any sense because that is theres so much truth behind that you work work work you bust your ass you try so hard to get to this level you get there in order to maintain that you know you just got to keep cranking out that work and in the absence of doing that it starts to feel like youre not successful its like a reluctance to look in the rearview to appreciate how far youve come because you can only see todays demands as creators we feel like we have to constantly create to remain relevant because people will forget relevancy is this word that I think gets thrown around way too often on YouTube because I think relevancy or clout is way over hyped Klout cloud is something that is by definition temporary you have clout you have relevancy today but what does that mean for tomorrow heres a good example in the 1980s there was this great band they were really popular the most popular band on planet Earth Music talk about relevancy talk about clout New Kids on the Block was it they were like theyre the biggest band on planet Earth at their peak you know here we are whatever it is 2013 nobody talking about New Kids on the Block nobody still listening to their music and when you compare them to you know musicians that maybe never achieve that level of clout at their peak but made you know truly meaningful work that lasts longevity   clout and in my humble opinion it is quality that leads to longevity its making meaningful work that yields a career that will last not chasing clout not chasing relevancy today but instead making work that that an audience that viewers that people can believe in and get behind that is how you build a long meaningful career and I do think that that is something thats tremendously undervalued on YouTube on a platform that has the immediate gratification system of you count and comments being your own boss is a curse this is like the section where Im quoted but I never said being your own boss is a curse being your own boss is an amazing amazing thing but it comes with a kind of responsibility and a weight that is that can be overwhelming and its a kind of responsibility that when I work for other people I I didnt have but I still think it working for yourself is one of the most rewarding things in the world okay okay Casey and I stat for example is known for his high production value videos by his nearly 11 million subscribers he told Insider its a constant unrelenting pressure no matter what Im doing whether Im on vacation with my family or Im holding my baby daughter I have this constant pressure as most creators do that is what am I getting upload today first world problems for every supportive comment welcoming a creator back after time off theyre the ones who call them out for having first world problems and cant find the sympathy for people living an enviable life like a youtuber this is like so painfully I think a lot of YouTube viewers harbor ambitions or at least you know some desires to be youtubers or want to be successful youtubers so when you see somebody like me and other successful youtubers who have been lucky enough to achieve a level of success and then you start to hear us bitching about how hard it is and all of these pressures why should you feel empathetic towards us I understand that and I also think that can be a very isolating thing for creators because you dont feel like youre allowed to talk about the struggles and hardships that come along with having the like a wonderful incredible lucky career and when you feel like you cant talk about the negative parts you start to feel alone you start to feel isolated and you start to feel like maybe these problems are made up maybe I dont have a right to try to you know discuss these things or get help for these things or vent my own frustrations I find this part very optimistic Shane Dawson who has nearly 20 million YouTube subscribers is on a YouTube hiatus after filming an eight part docu series about Jake Paul Dawson has kept his crown as the king of YouTube even though hes been absent for three months other craters like idubbbz and nerd city can also upload infrequently and get millions of views when they do and and I have to say like I find that so optimistic I see what like Ian what I dubs can do where he disappears he uploads nothing he doesnt even use Twitter that much and then when he comes back with a video its a video that people want to see and it explodes and Shane does the same thing masterfully his Jake Paul docu series was huge and he did that without Im sure he felt pressure but he did that without sort of succumbing to the pressure of feeling like he needed to upload every single day so Lindsey Dodd Dodgson thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful piece about YouTube creators and creator burnout what does all that mean for me and my channel look I feel the same kind of burnout that I think every creator in this article describes and I kind of made a deal with myself when the baby was born in October little Georgie was born then I was going to make my being psyched Id say my mental health that sounds way too heavy handed I want to make my enthusiasm for YouTube a greater priority than that unrelenting pressure to upload every day I need to find a greater sense of confidence in the fact that this audience this generous audience has given me so much in my career you know will be there when I choose to upload and I think thats why you know I went from seven days a week to now a few days a week thats why I dont hesitate now to take a break to spend time with my family and it feels right it feels like Im doing the right thing I do add though as a huge caveat to that that I have no regrets about the sacrifices that I made to build this channel and theres been a lot of talk of like hustle porn lately that is like glamorizing glorifying romanticizing this idea of hustle work all the time and if look I believe in that I really do what it took for me to get this channel from 200 000 subscribers to 10 million was not sleeping was uploading every single day for like two and a half years I busted my ass to build this channel and I appreciate that and I dont have a whole lot of sympathy for people who arent willing to do that but want the success hard work is always required to get to where you want to be you know I never

Tony Hawk's 1 piece of advice for success,2018-12-28T18:05:17Z,11.95,1833075,76649,hello and welcome today on the program we have a special presentation just one of those episodes Im so excited about making that I can barely contain myself these balloons have nothing to do with todays special presentation Im a long believer that the secret in life is to find something you love to do and do it for the rest of your life I think you just gotta find something you love to do and then do it for the rest of your life and for me at age 37 I think that thing is making movies making videos and if I can figure out how to do this for the rest of my life I think that Ill be much closer to a kind of happiness that with any luck will carry me through the rest of my life but today I get to meet one of my heroes and this individual has done just that hes taken the one thing he loves more than anything and figured out how to do it for his entire life so far and I have been waiting to meet this person for the last nine thirty seven minus twenty twelve years old thirty seven 10 30 Ive been waiting to meet this guy for the last 28 years of my life since I was a kid this is a huge moment for me he should be here any moment he should be here any minute Im supposed to be here at 11 currently 11 supposed to be here just running a little high just running a little late Tony Hawk has soared to success on and off the halfpipe with his passion for skateboarding and business ventures its not easy to become the leading skateboarder in the world I mean you get to the pinnacle of anything well what was it that set you apart from all the other skateboarders out there I call you a professional skateboarder that doesnt seem to do it justice I would say manager of a multi billion dollar brand ambassador the youth I mean youre way past a skateboarder at this point my aunt my only secret is that I never quit doing it ladies and gentlemen I would like you to meet the one and only Tony Hawk hello hello okay so Tony I grew up you know I watched when you did your 900 oh yeah I was like watching the X Games that day really yes I dont like miles like my buddies and I were like watching it just like cheering it on Applause the idea that skateboarding could be something that you could ever make a living at is just like when I was a kid its just the idea thats it incomprehensible and you built this like extraordinary career with nothing but like a skateboard yeah it was I think I there was a lot of right time right place in my life but when I first started skating it was on its way out in popularity so it was skateboarding well skateboarding was yeah so it was hard to get any support skate parks for drawing up theyre closing left and right all my friends were over it it wasnt cool anymore they didnt do it and I did find a community at the skate park and and it wasnt I didnt think I was choosing occur cause I was so young so so what it meant so it wasnt like you you had these dreams of being rich and famous from skateboarding that didnt exist the top skaters in the world were never rich and famous they if anything got their picture in the magazine and then they had to quit when they turn 18 because they need to find a job right success then was like stickers I was competing competing it was all about competition how do you know this guy how do I know Tony yeah come on man what kind of question is that Ive seen this guy ESP at X Games all kind of stuff man I didnt plate as videogames everything man lets do it as a legend its like standing next to lowly type sure this is a legend right here skating was such a small community and youre already an outcast of youre a skater I was an outcast in an outcast community because people didnt like my style of what they were doing and so I think there was a silver lining of that as it has set me up later for haters right because I was already in this community that I all they wanted was validation and they were just like dude Styles a joke youre a little kid and so you know as I started came into my own and figured out that style and learn new tricks and finally was recognized for it then I learned that to believe myself Tony youre the big winner from Del Mar and I guess they expect everybody expect you to repeat that performance here do you think youd be able to do it oh no Im pretty tough time this pool what were some of the moments where it started to feel like this could this hobby could become a job I was 17 I was a senior in high school and I bought a house here that kids and that was a challenge to stay focused on school to stay in high school to stay in high school yeah I mean and because I I had a house where no parents were ever home so the party was always in my house and it was you know it was kind of a scene it was a challenge 19 year old Tony Hawk is king of the cult inventor of such maneuvers as the 720 thats two midair somersaults the Madonna and the Frigidaire between appearances and sales of his own boards he earns an excess of 150 000 a year skateboards have been very very good to Tony yeah for me it has been I bought a house that kind of mininum in Carlsbad but but I want to stick it through because I wanted to you know from for one I didnt want to disappoint my parents sure and all through high school even my careers teacher were like you cant thats what youre doing is short lived and you have to have all these skills to fall back on you know for a job how old are you Im 5050 yeah did you if you were to ask seventeen year old Tony Hawk do you think youll be still be riding Bertran City what do you think seventeen year old Tony Hawk would says uh yeah good man when did he when did your first when did Tony Hawk pro skater come out in 1999 now you know we had worked on it for about two and a half years prior to that and it was Tony has a new video game coming out thats why hes here today but 99 yeah 99 yeah Activision approached me and said were working on a skate game we dont know if you want to get involved and I went up there and saw what they were working on this this engine and the motion that they had go and if only you knew how much Tony Hawks Pro Skater I played growing up like 1 2 3 for the n64 for the PlayStation Im jealous do you think that he gets upset when people talk about him because his video game instead of the fact that hes like one of the greatest skateboarders in the history of I think though that he is synonymous with his video games like Tony Hawk is known as Tony Hawk because of the video games so why why your new game Tony has new game launching today yesterday tomorrow today yeah its watching today yes why are you doing it again well I had the opportunity to work on a mobile platform and that was exciting to me because we can update it constantly every day even like multiple times a day if we want to people go whats your user name I havent created one yet because Ive been the only beta testing so Ill create one right now for you but somebody else has the name Tony Hawk lets see about that what is the user name on this one a lot of toner because yeah ok he he made the game you just yes you are CAS ey yeah you can get thats that developer you made the game so Im toner because my thats my nickname that my stepkids call me oh hey Tony Hawk the great Tony Hawk what is what is one piece of advice youd give to someone today whos trying to chase down their passion and turn it into something that cant carry them through their whole life its a big question on the spot but the best advice I can give is is to truly do what you love learn all aspects of it even if its not the thing that things arent interesting to you maybe or as exciting risks and sexy because in the end youre gonna benefit from knowing all the facets of this thing that you love doing and if youre doing that thing the success might come it might not come financially but youre gonna love what you do mm hmm and thats way more sick to me thats a better measure of success than getting like I know people that make tons of money theyre miserable me too and and thats not the key to happiness the key down is doing what you love and its not the most financially successful thing it doesnt matter because you love going to work every day I mean look at you I love what I did I know thats you you are living the dream thats my line when people say what do you like how you doing livin the dream just everyday just living the dream and sometimes the dream takes a turn yeah its still fun of course Applause Music whatever way you want to Tony thank you for coming by you cute thanks for having me thats yeah thanks for being in my video my pleasure Ill try to make sure you look its not going to be hard but Ill make sure you look cool but whatever you do go hes still skating so good go download his game its on the App Store right now I want his game to go up in the ratings or whatever after this video goes live that way you know maybe hell hang out and again sometime Music can I ask you something and if this is super weird or like gross in any sort of way or makes you uncomfortable just say no okay can I try ollie on your skateboard man yes ah okay okay your do you need to move no pressure a lot of,155.73221757322176,incomprehensible,0.0,1.0,lDfu8pA8tlo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDfu8pA8tlo
Exploring Elon Musk's Boring TUnnel,2018-12-20T18:17:06Z,6.85,3123858,96761,Music this is Casey and I start with KTLA 5 live coming at you from the boring Im not with Katie l5 but I really am at the boring whole launch site today is like the first day when they open it they invited me which is great youre gonna go see it big hole Im in the boring press tent and you get some boring snacks and let me explain what just happened so were in the press center right there Im meeting my boring snacks and the dude comes over and hes like were taking people in groups its 800 come with us and then we do this tour they talk about tunneling the technology and all that stuff and everybody is taking notes because we werent allowed to take any pictures or any video but like I didnt bring a pen and paper Idol I didnt know what to do so just trying to pay attention then at the end theyre like do you want to go in the boring tunnel like in the actual in the tunnel and of course I said yes heres how it work no pictures allowed you get into a Model X like a like a Tesla the Tesla SUV and then we like drove to this secret location a mile and a half from here that was in the back of like a mini mall kind of store this gate opened like a like a regular chain link fence open theres a dude in there I think youre not a dude in there with like a bulletproof vest and a handgun on his chest I think he was just there as security but it was very dramatic opens we drive him the PAR that model its was on this little like elevator track and then it goes down Music and we go down and the tunnels ahead of us now I was thinking the tunnel was gonna be like a huge like subway tunnel its not its small its like just big enough to fit a Model X in it and then theres like two little spots on either side for the Xs wheels to go on and then the Model X was custom retrofitted with like bumpers okay look look look see these things these are the bumpers that kept these things are the bumpers that kept the Tesla from hitting the walls inside the tunnel cc1 there one there and there and like the wall would be here the wall will be here and keep it from you know when you go through like a car wash and the thing keeps you on the track thats what it was like and then we get the Model X and what about they said 30 miles now if we look 44 is where we topped out it going through the tunnel Music it was amazing but it was also just driving a car through like a really small scary tunnel so a little bit scary mostly incredible like it was pretty everybody the car was like pretty psyched it was cool okay so were going down to where the hole is but this is where when I was before we werent allowed to fill but the hole is the hole that I drove through this is where it came out of when I was in the X before look came out of this hole and we drove from okay so look this is the tunnel this we keep getting closer they tell me not to this is a boring tunnel Music Im doing the same thing Im doing but you got a camera guy so there were some whispers and some not so subtle whispers of like skepticism or cynicism towards the whole boring project and there were a lot of people like I I specifically remember hearing one person say keep in mind guys he didnt invent tunneling this has been done before nothing were seeing here is really new and there were definitely throes of that kind of skepticism being tossed around I do not share that cynicism I I dont share that skepticism being at this event was like magical and incredible and it captured my imagination and heres why heres this guy who whatever it was 18 years ago 20 years ago wanted to start an electric car company to hopefully displace combustion engines and then here we are now in 2018 and I dont know what the number is but this year they shipped hundreds of thousands of cars he did it and this is the same guy the same exact guy who had an idea to launch rockets into space and build a company that does that and in 2018 SpaceX launched 19 rockets into space which isnt just more than any other private company in the world but its more than any other nation on the planet with the exception of China so when that same guy says that he wants to address or try to help address like congestion and cities by digging tunnels that cars can drive through and then that guy actually digs a tunnel that you can actually drive a car through yeah its exciting because its about its about what it could be its about your imagination and doing things and and sort of like brushing off the critics because youre trying to do something that maybe nobody else is looking at or nobody else is doing thats where my enthusiasm comes from and thats why this was such an exciting event for me to be at and they they threw a great party too okay and that that concludes the boring tunnel boring you guys I got a fake Music,140.43795620437956,specifically,0.0,1.0,ZhMvlTLE14E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhMvlTLE14E

DJI OSMO Pocket vs. GOPRO 7 (which has better stabilization??),2018-12-05T15:46:17Z,9.916666666666666,4247164,85201,listen doesnt sound like the mini fridges is snoring lets go a little buddy Music Applause what and got me tech review Tuesday alright on todays episode of tech review Tuesday Ive got a very exciting new thing for us to review that is the is not too bright let me just bring this down just sit that is the DJI Osmo pocket DG I sent me this little bastard about a week ago and Ive been dying to play with it havent really done anything but turn it on yet meet Osmo pockets a compact stabilized smart camera that was made to fit in every moment so what this is is a tiny itty bitty miniaturized small very small tiny its almost indescribable what it feels like to hold this in your hands it feels like something that came from the future to give you like a little context of what a 3 axis gimbal typically looks like this is what my this is what my first three axis gimbal looks like this is this is what it looks like without a stand you put the camera right here this is the DJI Ronin S this is another three axis gimbal this is for like SLR cam SLR cameras and this is the like GoPro 3 axis gimbal you put a GoPro in there and its this size now for scale I mean its almost absurd it even you see that size difference like crazy it even comes with this little carrying case which I have to say DJI did a very good job putting this together and these are like regular jeans if you look at how theyre positioning this and you look at the features integrated in this I think DJI thinks this could be sort of a one stop shop for vloggers or you know like this is a small video camera replacement now DJI is one of my favorite companies because they make tools that make it easier for like amateur creators like me to make their content and understanding what this thing does a miniature stabilized pocket camera it made me think of another company that does a good job creating tools for amateur creators like me that also just launched a pocket sized camera that specializes in amazing stabilization and thats the new GoPro seven so todays tech review Tuesday is gonna pit the DJI Osmo pocket against the GoPro Hero 7 and this is gonna be less of like a competitive thing and more just trying to show you what these things look like side by side this ones 399 bucks this ones 350 bucks this one has a mechanical gimbal this ones optically stabilized this ones super tough this one well it feels pretty tough maybe not GoPro tough but tough so Im gonna test this thing while riding a skateboard because I always ride a skateboard and skateboards are bumpy and it seemed like a good and the skateboards bumpy enough I need a bumpy place to test something thats all about its stabilization all right so heres how Im gonna do it Im gonna do one shot with the go from to do one shot with the Osmo pocket same exact shot split screen them side by side and then you tell me which one looks better okay Im gonna do it right here Music Music Music Music both these cameras have pro modes but Im shooting in full auto default 4k by 30 and its down res for this video to 1080 but Im not doing anything special here no pro mode this is what both of these cameras look like straight out of the box see what the sound sounds like and I dont know I cant see how wide it is is my whole head in this shot is this a viable vlogging camera mmm no idea the suns pretty though isnt it alright same shot in the GoPro holding it out using like a blog camera this is the native audio on the GoPro no microphone or anything I know this thing works as a vlogging cameras Ive used it before its so cold out right now its unbelievable alright same shot in the GoPro holding it out you see like a vlog youtubers do talking into it I know this thing works as a vlogging camera son used it before okay so both these guys have a time lapse feature and Im testing that now provided focus provided I dont freeze to death curious to see how they come out Music outside the quick shootings it was so cold outside okay so before I came home I went to the local skate park to get some like real world cinematography from these things very very exciting device from DJI I appreciate what theyre doing for for sort of the prosumer market for 350 bucks this thing is a movie making machine there are a bunch of other features that I didnt test in this video like face tracking it also does one feature Im excited about which is like moving time lapses where you just sort of program at this place in this place and theyll do a slow time lap for hands using the gimbal those kinds of features used to be inaccessible unless you have professional equipment now tiny device like this lets you do that and I think that these kinds of products are indicative were the entire industry is going small relatively inexpensive and they emulate what used to only be able to be done with big very expensive equipment all right thats it for this weeks tech review Tuesday be sure to tune in next week where were gonna have the world premiere of dan mesas tech review Tuesday intro until then Ill be well Im gonna take a warm bath Music Applause Music,99.32773109243698,cinematography,0.0,1.0,07kJSgNNdTM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07kJSgNNdTM
"we'll pay you $5,000.00 to design the 368 logo",2018-12-04T19:52:21Z,13.2,1439111,44670,the mission statement 4 3 6 8 is to simply Music its uh good to be back in New York but its Julie won today good to be back in New York then to get my boosted board to ride into work this morning and realize no boosted board well the TSA took my boosted board Ive got a watch I seldom walk to work anymore I like bikes or skateboards walking is just so inefficient but you do it look at its size that all in here Music you see things in this town when you walk then you dont see how can electric skateboard its like a little Odyssey full adventure before I go in put a cup of coffee for my neighborhood copy copy play hit coffee place we get coffee thank you that is why I typically dont walk to work not that I mind the walk its just just grossly inefficient oh hey big news Keith United step merch that is this new merch and this sweatshirt in red and I think that we have a couple of other designs its up on the like KC and Shop KC nice calm right now and like the company that I work with just to make and sell this my merch they wanted to do like a Black Friday sale but I like wasnt posting videos and it was Thanksgiving that felt weird to just post a video just about merch so I didnt do it so were gonna do a Black Friday sale this week so from when this video goes live through the end of the week all my old merch which would have a lot of we have some of all the old merch is 40 off and all the new brand new just announced merch is 20 off go check it out link is here link is below three six eight my company that I launched eight eight months ago with the ambition to create like a place where creators could create and find help and resources and stuff if you remember back the last time I talked about it I said something along the lines of I no longer wanted to say were going to do this and I wanted to be able to say we are doing this not talk about intention but talk about action well it took us a little while but Im happy to say we got a lot of action to talk about any company has a mission statement and the mission statement is sort of the overarching goal of that company or that entity I like to think of it as like the North Star so no matter what decision we make we check that decision against our North Star and say does he get us closer to achieving that goal okay so Music the mission statement 4 3 6 8 is to simply helping creators climb the ladder to success escalator style this is actually a line from a kind of an obscure biggie small song but its totally appropriate Music meaning what do creators need to succeed how can three 6ap a resource that enables people to do that its a thats a very big question to answer but slowly we are making progress so one thing we have to offer is space we have an abundance this is a huge space upstairs weve got our podcasts and recording studios here we got some still photo studios over here we have this you know Ashley grand the supermodel she shoots her podcast over here theres a woman running out to me crying right now and it depends on you know where II look thats three six eight yeah we also now have this amazing overhead shooting rig if someone needs to shoot like a tech review video this is great for that and this here this is the 368 gaming area so we do sometimes competitive gaming and get togethers and things like that that happens here weve got machines all up and down this space but lighting down here is great we finally got the acoustics figured out weve got custom lighting on each machine for live streaming we even have a 368 gaming hangout zone you know someone they gave me energy we even have the obligatory mini Red Bull fridge Music and we do a lot of cool things in this space we have some creators who like Sam Shepard who youve met before if he shoots his podcast down here its a lot of its game or focused we did an event a little while ago with battlefield 5 weve actually done two events with them little gaming sessions these guys are all pro gamers but about 10 minutes ago we opened up 368 to the public so anybody can come by any game with us for like the next couple hours we also have pizza coming Music and during that day they actually II actually shot a TV commercial for television here at 368 and thats amazing and then of course weve got that kick ass 368 kitchen right here where you know like cooking channels or cooking youtubers can come and do their thing here another really exciting partnership weve got happening soonish is bnh which is kind of like the best camera store in New York City theyre building a gear closet for us at three six eight so we have gear for people to also use it all kind of begs the question which is how does someone how does it create or get to use our resources and thats really hard to answer thats like the hardest problem we have to solve so it is open it is available if you want to use some of our resources just like go to our terrible website three six eight dot NYC please dont crash it and you can like email us there and tell us what you want to use it for and thats totally ad hoc but thats how were hey dont thats how were like just doing it for now is like people email us and then we email them back were like cool house Wednesday and thats sort of it and there are like a ton of little tiny problems that we need to figure out before 368 becomes the vibrant like I want that place packed with creators all day every day and right now were sort of like cherry picking creators that we believe you know want to use it in the right way so a couple of weeks ago we did something called a creator Thanksgiving we turn the like the store into well its meant to look like your Samsung sponsored it Thank You Samsung it was expensive to put on we flew in 20 creators we brought we had some big creators there mostly those small creators like a lot of creators there with under a thousand subs and we did a big talk like in the middle of the whole party we had a talk which is how can we be better what do we need to do before three six eight the vision becomes realized Music something craters is what do you guys think is needed in a place like New York City or a place like or that I feel like centralizing something for the YouTube creator community that clip by the way is from the video from the night I didnt make the video like one of our partners did like this company that were working with thats awesome our production partner at three six eight they did it but you can see the whole video at three six eight two YouTube channel Ill link it below go easy on us of the YouTube channel we dont have any content up there yet we will if you dont want to subscribe I understand but were getting there the last three six eight thing that I want to talk to you about is well its a three six eight project that involves that involves you well not all of you but some of you Music Maxie Im trying to pitch the explain the Adobe project but maybe you help me yeah its kind of like Americas Next Top Model but like the creative version you dont want to sell anything while I explain this Ill call you in and were not ready okay this project the one that max he was just talking about this is the latest three six eight real big project its with Adobe Adobe as in the company that makes Premiere and Photoshop and Lightroom and most of the tools that creators and creatives use to make stuff so what Maxie was going on and on about is we dont have any like creative DNA at three sixty eighty we dont have a logo we dont have like a trailer and that explains who we are and what we do were have any imagery that youd really associate with three six eight like this is like KCs thing and what we came up with would you call it Americas Next Top Model yeah what we came up with is why dont we do like an open call to the world where we reach out for designers in filmmakers or video editors theyre out there cuz theyre out there yeah and I hire them 368 hires them to come work for us freelance we pay creators what is already paid 5 000 something I dont know what we pay creators to come do like a freelance week with us here in New York and two together although not really together no I want them to do it but the idea is that like I think that sometimes the best judge of like what things should look like should be someone from the outside with fresh eyes so they have fresher I said they come two three six eight like for a week its kind of like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory like you invite your Willy Wonka in this scenario and you invite them like the kids and like and then they kind of see how it works they see the sausage factory from the inside right and then theyre like okay this is what the font should be were doing that okay let me just Im gonna link it below all the informations down there we just announced it but this is happening really soon its December 10th to 15th so its like next week or two weeks or something right its basically like an all expenses paid trip to New York to the three six eight Casey Neistat Chocolate Factory but theyre also getting paid that were gonna go do work yeah were hiring yeah youre giving like a no party its not itll be fun but itll be like work fun very exciting all right all of the details are below I think the only thing that you have to do to be a part of this and like looking at the the key points for the call to action are you have to be a subscriber to Adobes YouTube channel Ill link that below too but other than that I think you just you just like it I dont know click the link below and youll what yeah I think you should mention Music thats like it didnt love you these three six eight things theyre all like theyre kind like one off things with each one of them represents what we want to do in a big scale and every time we do want to get closer to where we want to be theyre all learning experiences its all very exciting all right see to you Music,150.0757575757576,neighborhood,1.0,1.0,S5TGPGACJ2M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5TGPGACJ2M

flew straight back here to New Orleans to finish shooting this movie finished shooting my tiny little itty bitty part tiny itty bitty part in this gigantic Netflix Jamie Foxx like amazing action movie I dont know if its gonna be amazing yet because I havent seen it and its not done but the directors are total geniuses Jamie Foxx is amazing the cast is amazing and its gonna be amazing because everybody involved is just brilliant and what Ive seen on set is like so thats what Im doing here and Ive been here all week and its just been like its been a lot of and its been a lot of stuff that really requires a tremendous amount of focus tremendous amount of focus from me you need me and makeup okay Ill put my costume on okay okay okay okay and see while Im doing these things like I mean I havent been here with all my siblings in one place Searcy for a holiday so you cant assist him that hasnt happened in ever Ive never been involved with like a movie production of this size before and I kind of like through this whole process I realized that you know I want to make youtube videos when I want to make youtube videos I dont want to make youtube videos when I feel like I have to make

like a little carton thats how you get like nice smooth shots this is super cool this is part of the set here and to make it look like when youre in the set that that little window actually faces the outside is pretty gigantic light shining in there which is great this over here this is called video village and this is where like the directors and a lot of the cast is not in a scene sits while theyre waiting to be called up and then these monitors here or where they can see whats being shot and filmed in the set this is the stunt squad here these guys theyre really good fighters so on the set here theyre about to shoot a big action sequence with lots of explosions what did I say I said listen Music and thats what uh thats what an action thats what the action scene sound like Music okay

Casey nice that congratulations on passing 10 million subscribers ah so I thought today a fun little video a fun little experiment would be to go ahead and saw this in half and see whats on the inside these are the guys these are guys okay this is Dan and this is thanking these guys have a fantastic youtube channel called whats inside where they cut things open and see whats inside how do you guys come up with the name it was my science project and we had to pick a question so we decided to do whats inside sports balls but then we just named the channel whats inside so we can have more things not just for sports yeah you wanna see it yeah have you seen it before no Im alright its heavy and its like solid something so careful of it and not so were gonna use the cuts to do do do do careful ok what do you do just kidding we made a fake one so you do that stun wheres the real ones whatever shatter now you crowd just drop it all right what do we ready we this is metal but this thing is made out of crystal and we dont want to take the metal blade and put it on the crystal because I like my eyes my face its what does it call its its led free crystal Im sure youre good at this yeah do it will it shatter oh wait does this happen oh yeah careful of sharp on the backside a little glue let me see if I can get the metal bit off the bottom its glued on there really well that didnt happen okay all right well now so the rest of this is completely solid so if were gonna get into this I dont think theres gonna be diamonds but were just yeah the logo here this ones actually mine congratulations on passing ten million subs okay I love that were doing this do you guys know how to use a chop saw like safety we have a saying you know some people say like safety is our number one priority were like safety is in our top five so I dont know thats a terrible idea Music look this is actually mine Music I just blew a fuse did it work Applause Applause Music Applause Music do you feel bad I mean this is an award your Diamond Award you feel bad about cutting it people always ask me that in the comments um do I feel bad I honestly I dont think I would have done it if we havent told them theyre not in on the secret yeah so we did a video where we went to YouTube award headquarters and while we were there they showed us tab they showed us a blemished Diamond Award so we printed on there but it was already a blemished one that they didnt order we cut my actual now this is a blemished one you sure just a little bit of blemish so wheres that good one pretty sure they should we cut the right way okay youre right okay okay so look this is an actual one that we cut in half its real just were gonna send it to anyone so we engrave their name on the back this was like a faulty one yeah yes but this is a genuine one if you get ten million subs this is what you get thats the real one okay so Dan and Lincoln here made a fantastic video where they actually go and they visit like the factory where they make not just the diamond play buttons with the gold ones and the silver ones its pretty fascinating seeing like the assembly line yeah I mean what other platform does something like this where they give their creators an award that cost money time theyve changed them over the years to make them better are you trying to like jockey for some YouTube network isnt here that would be nice no but Ill link it below go over to their channel where they made like a longer video it really is interesting I think the most telling thing was like that shot where theres a table and theres like hundreds of gold play buttons just lined up and its sort of the only its the only like realization or physical thing where you get to see how many people are crossing that threshold to a million subscribers every day every day okay thank you for watching please dont cut anything in half at home we are professionals and especially dont cut and have a solid piece of wood

Living in NYC during a Crisis,2018-10-25T23:52:42Z,8.216666666666667,1858521,56768,hello today is October 24th 2018 and for usual I am shooting this video in my studio in downtown Manhattan in New York City whats not usual is what happened will happen in a few places but what happened in New York City this morning Mary and Chris we all just got alerts on our phone telling everyone in the area of 58th and 8th to shelter in place immediately take a look behind me you can see 58 is actually blocked off at ninth Avenue NYPD officers SWAT teams state police all here on scene working to contain the situation there was a bomb discovered this morning at the CN n offices which is in the Time Warner building in midtown here in New York City important detail no one was injured the NYPD great job bomb squad great job happy to hear that a lot of my former colleagues and and friends are at CNN so you can hear me was also and to turn on the TV all the news channels theyre running this story just over and over and then if you look at news online like this is the New York Times on Fox talks about a bomb CNN even on BBC which is a more of a global news source top item there is about an explosive and an explosive being sent to New York City and pretty usual they talked about the resilience of New Yorkers that its still business as usual here in the city of New York so I want to make a little video thats what this is showing you you know people at home people watch this YouTube channel from all around the country and all around the world to show you what its like actually to be here in New York City as a denizen of the city as someone who lives here you look at it on TV it feels like that the whole citys standing still and everythings stopped because of this like really terrible incident but whats it actually like here I want to make very clear that the people in New York City will not be intimidated that we are going to go about our lives undeterred because the very concept of terrorism is to change us and we will not allow that to happen this is Manhattan now my studio my office is down here in downtown Manhattan the incident took place in midtown here right at 59th Street do you know what happened this morning at the CN n building in Midtown no I think I just got like a notification on my like service alert thing was that there was like a thing that the bomb squad picked up yes yeah I just found out about have you noticed anything like different in the city because of that incident no okay well like we just found out on the train and everyone like got the little notifications on but it was kind of like whatever because we get that all the time for like Amber Alerts I havent noticed anything have you know Music you cannot be terrorized if you refuse to allow the terrorists to win people the city have shown time and again that they stand up in the face of these efforts to intimidate do you know where happened this morning I like I live around there and I got at work amberle er which scared me why Im not sure there was like type that happened yeah Im trying to make a movie like whats it like to be in the city on something like that happen Stano is anything any changes would people the city at large when something like that takes place well being new newly moved here and when I found that out in the workplace I saw a shift and everyones demeanor I think it put everyone in a really sick to their belly feeling and it scared me especially as someone thats new to the this is 53rd and 7th this is about six block seven blocks from where the incident took place this morning I wouldnt know who looking around that anything that todays different from any other day here in here in midtown Manhattan open a block closer so Im gonna get a little closer and see what I can see there is an increased police presence here but Im like a block away from the Time Warner building oh yeah have you noticed anything different in the city today because of what happened this morning um well theres a lot of police and like a lot of like you know what happened no there was an explosive device found and thats my mobility oh my god with a block there its really important at a moment like this to remember the vast majority of Americans the vast majority of New Yorkers are good people trying to live in peace with each other Music what I heard they say something like some bomb triggers like my dad when something like this happens do you notice any difference in the way the city operates people is gonna be this typical New York response would just be Im late for work my boss doesnt care we have to get to work or we have to get where to happen this morning and even this close to it I talked to a lot of people walking by and theres two schools of thought I know what happened and I dont care Ive got to live my life and I dont know what happened and I dont care I have to live my life its the reality its the world that we live in so people just gonna keep going on people gonna be vigilant but you know were gonna be vigilant but everyones gonna keep going you know doesnt stop in the office Music on the news and it feels like a huge global event it is and this isnt to undercut the significance of what happened but to really underscore the resilience of people in New York City the city just keeps going no matter what happens are the reason why I love it here so much what they are trying to do is scare us and destabilize us and we will not allow that to happen we are New Yorkers we are smart we are tough we are resilient and we will not allow these terrorist bugs to change the way we live our lives,133.14401622718051,notifications,0.0,1.0,KcyPbfAFw4A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyPbfAFw4A

Navy Seal Commander explains why wake up at 4am,2018-10-15T19:11:57Z,11.183333333333334,11189982,304948,Music Applause wake up so its 440 two in the morning this is usually my day begins this is what my day looks like this is what everyday looks like up between 400 and 500 always up between 400 and 500 cup of coffee then I sit down at my computer this is my favorite part see its these early morning hours that are the absolute most productive for me no phone calls no texts messages nothings happening on social media everyone else is asleep its just total focus that gives me between 5  7 am to get some work done 2 full hours before Francines up when shes up we make breakfast Music she leaves for school at 730 by 8 oclock Im out the door on my run my run always happens for me running this alone time is top priorities back from the run before 1000 shower shave get out door I need to work the commute to work its fast a 5 minute ride or so I didnt know what I was going til you said turn try to always be in the office by 1000 and then it works until I was sad yeah busy work email work phone calls work sitting my office eating in my office pass to the outside were having one 3 6 8 or meeting work meetings work meeting with this guy were talking to her was getting it done work leave the office before 6 6 oclock headed home 6 to 10 6 to 10 is family time and its non negotiable babies asleep before 10 I know she should be asleep sooner were terrible parents babys asleep at 10 I go to the gym from 1000 to 1100 11 oclock I pass out Levi what time what time do you wake up no I am Number 1 just on a practical side if you wake up early in the morning like at 430 in the morning youre gonna have some free time to yourself to make things happen to take care of things that are important to you lets say youre the most ultra motivated guy in the world when that alarm clock goes off theres at least 50 of the time where you just met that soft little pillow is just caressing your head and you want to stay there and it takes discipline to go nope Im gonna get up out of this bed Im gonna do what Im supposed to do and that discipline that you have at that moment you win that fight thats a big victory and then that that that pattern will carry out throughout the day because once youre up well now and Im up I might as well go work out because Im already up and I I feel good that I got up out of bed and I won that battle let me go win another battle Im gonna go get it done and then when you show up at the office and theres someone thats got a big box of doughnuts that theyre given away for free by the way so theyre just sitting its almost like an insult not to take them but when youve already gotten up early you had the discipline there you already worked out you have the discipline there and now you see the box of doughnuts youre like no Im not gonna eat the doughnuts no no doughnuts youre not gonna do it and that discipline carries on throughout the day so now you take that and you you expand that out over a week in a month and you end up with more discipline and it starts with that simple act of getting up and getting out of bed in the morning discipline starts every day when the first alarm clock goes off in the morning I say first alarm clock because I have three the moment the alarm goes off is the first test it sets the tone for the rest of the day the test is not a complex one when the alarm goes off if you get up out of bed Ruy there in comfort and fall back to sleep if you have the discipline to get out of bed you win if you are mentally weak for that moment and you let that weakness keep you in bed you fail though it seems small that weakness translates to more significant decisions but if you exercise discipline that too translates to more substantial elements of your life okay Jacqueline let me try to butcher your bio a little bit you you were a Navy SEAL commander Lieutenant Commander in the Navy SEALs you did how many tours in Iraq I did two tours in Iraq and then you actually you actually you were a Navy SEAL instructor so then you took your learnings from the battlefield and you taught future generations of seals what you learned yeah and a lot of times when people think about SEAL instructor they think of what you see on TV or SEAL team were here to get you out thats not actually the instructing that I did the instructing that I did was four seals that had already been through that basic training and maybe theyd made multiple deployments overseas but a seal platoon has to prepare and work together and get to know each other and learn how to function together as a team and in order to to in order to get there they go through pretty arduous training actually extremely arduous training and that was the training that I ran sometimes even if youre the most highly motivated person in the world that grind starts to beat you down a little bit and thats when you have to stop looking at the short term thing because thats not thats not getting you to get it done and you got to look okay what is the long term goal that Im looking at what am I really trying to get done in the long term and you say oh you know what Im actually waking up today early so I can be ahead of the curve so I can sell more of these widgets or whatever so I can buy a house and you know what today matters today matters this decision that Im making right now is that first step its me taking one stroke swimming in the right direction heading towards the shore and if I dont take this Im not making any progress okay Chacko one piece of advice for someone whos thinking about whether its waking up earlier just having more discipline in their day one piece okay discipline equals freedom that thats the best to keep you surprised so listen here have you written a book called that I did I did write a book its right here yeah the discipline it was freedom we all want freedom right we all want to have freedom we want we want to have financial freedom we want to have more free time we dont have physical freedom thats what we want everyone wants freedom of course but if you want to have freedom in your life the way to get to freedom is is through discipline its thats how you get there so if you want to be if you want to be financially free you have to have financial discipline you have to save your money you have to work hard to earn more money you have to not buy by stupid things that you dont actually need right you need to save that money and invest it properly if all that takes discipline and if you have that kind of discipline youll end up with more freedom if you want to be if you wanna have more free time everybody wants more free time but if you want more free time how are you gonna get it you have to have more discipline time management less fortnight more work when you get done doing something thats a complete waste of time how do you feel at the end of it all right terrible yeah you feel happy while youre doing it oh this is kind of fun this is this is stimulating my brain a little bit and then you get done with it and you realize that you could have done something productive and you dont feel good about just this play this guy why buckets of cold oatmeal every day I dont care about it just its just healthy and I feel good all day oh yeah thats thats a great example cuz everybody knows that when youre eating that cheeseburger I mean come on good but how but literally how bad do you feel 30 38 minutes when youve got done eating a cheeseburger and fries youre youre youre suffering if you are at work I yeah what about the people that blame circumstance for not being able to take ownership and build that discipline so theyre just constantly like pointing outside themselves how do they like acknowledge that but no I have the opportunity right now yeah but thats thats the fundamental core of of where this is a problem is when people look around and they blame they but if theyre in business they blame the market or they blame their competitors or if their personal life they being with their family they blame their parents they blame everyone else and they never look at themselves and say you know what maybe its not this is my fault but what can I do about it Music Im at a station Im never gonna find attract surprises you stand so the question I get asked most often about my schedule is where do you find where do I find the hours like how am I not exhausted all the time from waking up so uh see your hours of the day that time time is fungible meaning you can take hours from one part of your day and move it to another part of the day so I made a decision to take two worthless hours those the hours between 1100 pm and 100 am those are like Netflix and chill hours I took those hours totally unproductive hours I moved them to 500 am to 700 am so what used to be totally wasted hours are now totally useful hours so now I go to bed at 1100 but I get up at 500 and instead of having two hours of nonsense I have two hours of a hyper productivity first thing in the morning Music Jaakko has a fantastic podcast and a whole bunch of books including this new one everything is linked below go check them out this is great right uh well I guess so you said the modesty this one this is the book that Ive read its fantastic its so good okay and the kids books those kids books thanks for coming by Jacko thanks for having me man appreciate it

the VERY BEST SMARTWATCH...,2018-09-26T12:49:46Z,13.0,3485286,67183,you could hit this thing with a hammer and not break it Music Applause ready ah todays episode of tech review Tuesday were gonna be asking one simple question which is which SmartWatch is the best SmartWatch Music and I do want to apologize for not having this weeks tech review Tuesday intro complete dan who does the intros out of town will get to next week before I get into the specifics of each watch let me a little context so that is the SmartWatch spectrum on one end to be extreme is simply a watch this just tells the time doesnt know anything else they tell me the date just the time on the other end is a fully fledged wrist computer and then the middle you have like a fitness sports focused watch and then what I think is probably the the best competitor to the Apple watch Music thats the spectrum now before I get into the intimacys of each device theres another major factor to keep in mind as context when considering a SmartWatch and that is how much of a pain in the ass are they for what they give you in return and there is a very literal inversely proportional rationale to how much a SmartWatch can do versus how much you have to well how big of a how much of a pain in the ass it is Music so here is how the SmartWatch analysis will be taking place Ill be testing the watches build quality ecosystem capability and battery and this will include a regular watch watch the Garmin Phoenix five plus the Apple watch 444 millimeter and the big size galaxy watch now really the reason why I included a regular watch in this is because its just sort of axes of control bibble quality first up on build is the Phoenix five plus the build quality is excellent on this thing it does have a crystal face like the Apple watch beyond that all the way around this is its all stainless steel this is this is my old old one you see its a little bit T its a little bit scratched up a little bit weathered but these things are tough so overall theyre good build quality on the on the garment now the series for Apple watch this thing is truly stunning like to hold in your hands does feel like youre holding a piece of jewelry look at that action smooth you could tell Johnny Ives just like polish this thing clean very impressed with the build quality of the Apple watch my previous Apple watch this is the generation 3 Apple watch it exploded I mean it literally exploded what I think happened to some salt water got under the screen battery expanded screen popped off but its shattered these things are not built as tough as say a watch that looks like this the Apple watch is next up is the galaxy watch I will say the new galaxy watch has a certain heft to it its stainless steel it feels dense compared to the old Galaxy gear watches it has a great weight to it it feels really solid the plat the bottom on this is plastic it does feel a little bit I dont know it feels less jewelry like and more electronics like when you when you feel that but it still has a substantial feel to it and the mechanics on it feel feel great here that the galaxy watch does have the weight of the stainless steel which is beautiful overall Ive got to give it to the Phoenix 5 with the best build you can hit this thing with a hammer and not Frasers just kidding next up is the ecosystem starting with our control watch this is just a watch it doesnt doesnt have an eco system theres no eco system none next up is the Phoenix 5 now you can download new watch faces on the app and I think you maybe download some apps for it and stuff but theyre not super robust and a lot of the watch faces you can download are a little bit janky installing them is a little bit complicated so there is some ecosystem not a great ecosystem one thing it does well though for athletes is that the data that this collects does communicate with your other exercise apps like like straw or whatever it does that very well so thats kind of the only plus I would give this when it comes to ecosystem this is an area where the Apple watch really thrives and that ecosystem well it wasnt but after four years the ecosystem is now what you would expect from Apple and when you look to the new like heart rate features that this has the EKG features that this has I imagine that the ecosystem around this will only get more and more robust and the galaxy watch does have an impressive ecosystem this is a watch thats designed mainly for use with Android devices like your like your Galaxy Notes or whatever it is that you use but this doesnt use androids watch OS or whatever the hell its called this uses a proprietary operating system that is owned by Samsung called Tizen Wow I think the operating system is really amazing on this it is limited in its its ecosystem because the only watches that carry it are these Samsung watches one caveat that I would say there about the Galaxy Watts its kind of frustrating about the Apple watch is that the Apple watch doesnt allow third party developers to design watch faces for it so its pretty limited the galaxy watch does allow third party developers to make faces for it so theres a broader selection here I dont know why Apples so thats so limiting Music capability this is where I want to spend most of the times I think this is what differentiates these four devices see spoiler alert I dont know that I can say one is better than the other so really depends on what your needs are with that if you dont need a computer strapped to your wrist then you just get a damn watch you never have to think about it Ozzie tells you the time now if you want some smart capabilities well this is why I like the Garmin watch because for me it gives you the bare minimum of what you would kind of want so when you get a phone call it shows up on here you cant answer it on here you cant talk on here same with text messages it shows you the full text message on here beyond that when it comes to athletics I want my heart rate I want my my distance measured I want maps and and this does all of that and does that incredibly well so the capabilities on on this watch are vastly superior to just a regular old dumb watch but they arent quite as robust is like a full fledged smart watch this watch is basically a miniaturized iPhone strapped to your wrist and that could be a good thing or that could be a bad thing I will say historically Ive gotten almost every Ive gotten to I Apple watches before but Ive stopped wearing both of them because it just ended up being too much on my wrist more than I wanted to deal with III didnt need all of that there when it was all in my pocket like I dont I dont know why this exists but I love this I can watch my own YouTube videos on this watch now thats a thats a third party app that probably shouldnt exist but it does exist and I dont know I think that thats cool also for my capabilities perspective the operating system on the Galaxy watch I think is is certainly the best operating system any SmartWatch see because this is a round watch face when you bring up your apps like that you use this dial to navigate your apps and when you want to get into an app you just kind of tap it in the middle now comparing that the Apple watch where you do have a dial but its this sort of is useful but touching and rotating this tiny little crown isnt quite as intuitive as having one here so judging the capabilities of these devices is very hard because quantity the amount of things it can do is less important to the user and how well it can do the few things that are important to you but the Garmin watch only does a few things but it does them incredibly well the Apple watch does a lot of things but much for how many of those things are going to actually use same with the galaxy watch does a lot of things but how many of those things am I gonna actually use and this really underscores what is kind of my conclusion on this whole thing when it comes to judging which box is best for you the first question is what do you need it for and then last up the easiest is battery life so a regular watch watch a quartz timed battery operated watch batteries last several years well just call that ever the single most impressive part about the Garmin is that this thing even though it has a full color screen thats pretty low resolution and not that bright but a full color screen this battery depending on how much you use the GPS this battery will ask you two weeks if you use the GPS a lot itll last you like five days the battery in this is incredibly impressive so much so that when I travel I typically dont bring the charger with me the Apple watch they say gets a full day I dont know why theyre so modest about this Ive only used it for a couple of days but so far I get way more than a full day its not quite as good as the galaxy watch which gives you four days but I would say its somewhere between the full day   advertised in the four days that this gives you Music so the conclusion here is that its very very hard to objectively judge something like a SmartWatch because it has a lot less to do with the technical capabilities and far more to do with what exactly are you looking for in something that lives on your wrist I hate having to charge my cell phones every single day and one of the reasons why Ive never stuck with the SmartWatch is because I hate having to also charge my watch every single day I also have a tendency to break everything everything I touch so the robustness of a watch is a big priority for me theres been a lot of chatter about the Apple watch I think its deserving of most of that chatter because it is a very impressive device I do think this is the very best watch you could have on Android even though it doesnt run Android operating system so in conclusion which is best I dont know it really depends on what you want but what is exciting is that theyre theyre all pretty damn good I wouldnt underestimate these more simple athletic watches if you dont like the square on your wrist I wouldnt underestimate what the galaxy watch can do if you dont like carrying around a cell phone I wouldnt underestimate what a Smart Watch with an LTE chip in it could do I think weve arrived at a very interesting place with wearables and Im excited about where they go next that is it for this weeks tech Tuesday well see you back here next Tuesday with a great new intro from Dan mates

Making fun of people.,2018-09-19T17:56:53Z,9.383333333333333,1413056,49045,Music good morning for a run great morning but uh you see it looks beautiful over there but then stormy open up rain 8 running in the rain it does look like yeah it doesnt like the storms getting closer see this great band ear behind that is rain I mean Im no meteorologist but thats just my prediction Music Music okay much much to discuss today on the show I want to start things off with a really awesome update something that Ive been looking forward to sharing with you for a while now which is that a few weeks ago when I crossed the 10 million threshold I launched this t shirt and it was part of like an initiative to raise money for this young lady who lives in Flint Michigan her name is Mari she was trying to raise money to give the school supplies and backpacks to kids who otherwise couldnt afford it I announced that for every shirt sold we give four dollars to her fundraiser and we did it we sold twenty five hundred thousand thousand dollars to her fundraiser which Im going to give right now ha we did it guys good work everyone we did it we push Mari over her goal of 75 000 Mari I hope to meet you someday and I should say that Ive never met Mari Mari I hope to meet you someday her people and and she personally reach out to me on Twitter and weve been dealing a little bit so amazing getting to know you alright what else in the update theres nothing on here its just a blank pieces ah Twitter we got the handle on Twitter dont ask how we got that but we got the hand Ill follow 368 on Twitter well try to be interesting we have the same handle on Instagram I think we got the same handle on Instagram so now both the Instagram and Twitter handle 4 3 6 8 is simply at 3 6 8 that is called nepotism okay ah other update beam that you havent heard me talk about beam in a long time the team from being that I used to make videos with theyre still making videos they still operate independently theyre still doing their own thing and the stuff that theyre making is fantastic so Ill link their channel below theyre on YouTube send them some love you wont regret it Music my friend Griffin Harrington shot that this morning on the subway Griffin nice catch but that is that is really how wet it is in New York City today a couple days ago on Twitter I saw this video that was kind of going viral and it was this kind of like big mafioso looking dude sitting on like a public transportation train and he was just shaving matter of factly he had shaving cream on he was shaving and the people film me or sort of snickering and making a joke of it and it was it was and I remember my finger went straight the retweet button and I hovered over it I thought itd be funny to share its a very New York City moment but I didnt click the button and I thought for a second look maybe theres more to this story i whatever and then I scrolled on and I went on with my life so then this morning I see this news story thats trending and the title of the of the news story is man cant save II on train and viral video says dont judge so let me just Im just gonna read a little bit a man was mocked online after he was recorded shaving at his seat on a commuter train heading out of New York City said he was just trying to clean up after days spent in a homeless shelter the story goes on it says the truth Torres says is that the video captured him at a vulnerable moment he had been homeless staying at a shelter in New York City he reached out to his family for help a brother gave him money for a train ticket and then this is the part that really hit me hard he goes he left a shelter before having a chance to shower and clean up and he wanted to look presentable so the nut of the story is just that this guy has a really hard life hes trying to get some help he didnt want to look like a schlub so he shaved and he was ridiculed for it and the story ends by saying a quote from his brother maybe people will have more feeling knowing what this kids been through so the moral of the story for me is never judge generally like everybody has their own demons that theyre dealing with their own struggles that theyre dealing with so before before I judge I I want to make a more concerted effort to really try to empathize with others and thats what that thats that story just kind of made me think of hows it going how many captains today five five yeah Im Casey yeah Justin is this the most popular one so far it is Justin let me see okay and of all of Jeremys great designs what about that one you like the most I think its more most actionable probably its a good reminder I think to keep it in top of mine all the times Jeremy I was gonna give the your tattoo operation a plug anything I should say are all the slots gone I found a link below the Jeremy 368 tattoo project is up and running new designs every day and a couple of slots theres some left this week okay all right later eight skateboarding in the rain search after Dan got hurt standing in the rain at me Oh Dan I gotta talk to you about Dan dad was only here temporarily you know from the start but we werent sure when like that temporariness we werent sure how long the whole thing was gonna last and okay so I guess he was in Northern Ireland for like a video conference or something and instead of coming back to New York he had to go back to South Africa and he told me from South Africa hes like hey bro I heard you like the South Africa none of it made any sense theres something you had to deal with there apparently so I danced back in Cape Town not permanently but for now and its really sad because hes like three 6 8 cheerleader and mascot and hes just drawn dont forget us stand Music

THAT ELON MUSK INTERViEW and the dangers of VLogging.,2018-09-11T17:01:27Z,9.75,3472054,116860,how does it work do people get upset at you if you do certain things Music Applause Music Applause Music dont be dont be misled by the title or a thumbnail I dont smoke weed with Elon Musk in this video is obviously referring to the podcast that he did with Joe Rogan for the record though I have no problem with Elon Musk or any other adult smoking a joint in the state of California where its legal just like I wouldnt have a problem with they I dont have a glass of wine or drink a beer if you listen to or watch the podcast though I cannot recommend it enough in fact I have no no affiliation with Joe Rogan or his podcast but I will link it below and Ill link it at the end of this video yeah I think that because its funny everybody has just been talking about you know a moment at the end of that video where Elan musk takes a half of a puff on a blunt that he doesnt inhale the memes are incredible I cant blame people but what that podcast was was two and a half hours or a little over two hours looking into the minds of one of the people that I find most interesting Im fascinated by Elon Musk I owned a Tesla I read Ashlee Vances biography on Elon Musk I think hes a very interesting character and this Joe Rogan interview was the first time you were really able to see into his psyche where he was completely left his guard down so excellent worked over oven on the interview and Elon Musk I appreciate your candor now they talked about so many different things so many different important things like AI and the future of cars and space travel and everything in between but there was one moment in the podcast and I think it has a particular relevance to anyone who works on YouTube or anybody who considers themselves a social media influencer Joe Rogan and Elon Musk they start talking about social media and they talk about how Instagram makes you sad you and I were talking about social media before the about just not having Instagram when youre following and not dealing you feel better I think maybe particularly Instagram people look like they have a much better life than they really do and they sort of candidly throw out Joe Rogan throws out a quote and Elon Musk throw out a quote in those quotes just really so I think I think things like that can make people quite sad just by comparison because you just sort of you people people generally think of themselves relative to to others its its a were constantly re we based lining our expectations wasnt that a thorough quote the comparison is a thief of joy comparison is the thief of joy now this is whether this is true to life or not I think is debatable but I think where this is true and I say this as a youtuber and as someone who has made a living for the last several years sharing my entire life online I think that this has never been more true than with outlets like Instagram and outlets like YouTube vloggers especially lifestyle vloggers bloggers like me what works best what typically works best on YouTube is to share a happy lifestyle a successful lifestyle lifestyle thats full of excitement and smiles and beautiful things and a lifestyle that shows off how how amazing life is and on the other side of that you have viewers youve millions of viewers watching this incredible lifestyle and comparing the lifestyle that they see on the internet on YouTube to their own lives and and that comparison can steal joy because yeah if happiness is reality   expectations thats great too because their happiness is muted by the expectations that are falsely created by by creators and vloggers like me people look like they have a much better life than they really do right so by design yeah people are posting pictures of when they are really happy theyre modifying those pictures to be better looking so if you look at everyone on Instagram you might think man theyre all these happy beautiful people and Im not that good looking and I am not happy so I must suck you know and thats gonna they feel sad they were just talking about Instagram and I think Instagram is probably an easier thing to point to because youre literally putting filters to make yourself prettier and youre literally just selecting the images that make your life seem the most happy and fascinating but vlogging and YouTube in particular are far more complex than that far more nuanced than that as are the unrealistic and unfair expectations that come along with the kind of content that a lot of creators share and then the feeding off that comment section oh just sitting there like like its a fresh stream of love like youre getting right up to the source as it comes out of the earth and youre sucking thats a lot of butter emojis water you post a video showing what is a scrub clean version a filtered version of your your life which now is this unrealistically awesome life and youre immediately met with feedback in the comments that reinforce certain aspects of your life and then discourage other aspects of your life and then youre able to further scrub the content to better fit into that equation youre able to better sculpt your life to represent the version of your life that youre that that you believe your audience wants furthering the version of your life that is shared with the reality of your own life and then I think viewers can take that unrealistic fake reality and compare that to their own lives and it just leads to a lot of unhappiness comments and and this ability to project this sort of distorted version of who you really are but I worry about where it goes like whats the next one whats the next one now I dont have some brilliant solution as to how to address this I bring this up because it just it landed so close to home to me it really it really hit me hard Ive been obsessing over it and one of the only ways that I can kind of take things out of my brain and stop thinking about them is by turning them into a video but I will say this I dont think theres anything wrong with vlogging I dont think theres anything wrong with sharing the most beautiful pictures of yourself with the most beautiful filters edited in the most flattering way on Instagram but I do encourage whether youre thumbing through Instagram or watching youtube videos to always be conscious of why youre watching it and to watch for the right reasons watch out of curiosity watch because its a great escape escapism is a wonderful thing its why I love movies so much and most importantly to realize that when youre watching youtube videos when youre watching a version of someone elses life to know that you are seeing something that is really truly just entertainment you are not seeing someone elses reality because no matter how beautiful or how rich or how wonderful your life can seem we all deal with the same bullsh in life some of us just have more Instagram followers or YouTube subscribers which enable us to share these you know partially fictionalized versions of our lives and know that its entertainment know that its not reality and with

never get in an UNLOCKED POLICE CAR!!!,2018-09-08T15:05:03Z,7.683333333333334,1339270,44585,like 50 sure these are fake cop cars let me see what happens if I try and get in one Im in the cop car this is not a real cop car theres a picture car just movie pops I promise I didnt just get in a real cop car that was NYPD that was not a real car was a picture car Music Applause how you feeling going to Francines orientation well you know its really strange because Frannie is a baby I still see her as a baby yet when she goes into school she turns into like this adult and she gets all serious and quiet with her teachers and stuff change life it just keeps but because this morning with this school and work in Candice and Im running in the afternoon theres like this beautiful low sky that goes over like an orange strip of sky that silhouettes the Statue of Liberty right there I wish I had my camera here so I could its a beautiful all right so I I went home this time actually did it I got my camera Im trying to take a picture of the sky but its not so beautiful anymore its like I dont know that orange band that I just wanted to take a picture of and was so romantic and amazing is now just kind of just like gray mush but Im giving it my best shot Music Im going to be talking about three six eight a lot more moving ahead cuz like I feel like the train has left the station with the company like things are happening now all the time which is awesome alright so this is our on my computer here this is our three six eight live feed today at three six eight jeromys down there running his little tattoo parlor this is what it looks like yeah this is Jeremy this is a young lady getting a tattoo looks like hes getting the needle ready wait listen to the audio its like very tranquil somewhat calming classical music it didnt seem fair to play like actual audio where you could hear their conversation that felt like a violation of trust alright out there Im gonna go down I want to go downstairs and check out the tattoo situation but there are just a couple of questions that I saw in the comment section about 368 that really well they were frustrating so I wanted to address them number one somebody asked or said in a jerkish way jerk ish way that three six eight is an MC and MC n is a multi channel network something that used to be popular years ago theyre exploitive they took advantage of creators by taking a piece of their Adsense in exchange for like some services that were in my opinion BS I am NOT a fan of MC ends and three six eight couldnt be further from an MCN the other thing number two that was frustrating to read is we had our Taco Tuesday our first ever like creator gift together small little dinner party at three six eight earlier this week and somebody said something like how much does it cost to go it costs nothing is free these are events that we put on and we invite people so they can meet other creators and things like that thats not our business model okay lets go see some tattoos Music Music how how did he do is he good this is the livestream good luck Im having a great day all kinds of fun exciting things are happening today I have great days all the time and then this afternoon at like 4 oclock I saw on Twitter on TMZ that Mac Miller died I dont know Mac Miller Ive never met Mac Miller but he was 26 hes a hip hop artist always been a fan of his and I think music like movies like a lot of artistic mediums when youre really into someone elses creativity or or creations you sort of feel like you have a relationship with him I think Mac Miller always kind of took me because I I mean I remember when best day ever came out it was like 2010 or 2011 Im 10 years older than he is so when that song came out you know he was like 19 I just remember seeing that it was like this it was this anthem of loving life and realizing your passions and and like us all Im thinking Im just thinking about that so rather than like put on a happy face and be goofy for the rest of the video I just wanted to share with you how Ive been feeling for the rest of this day which is just like sad but when someone that young guys it also like it sends me into this place where I just think about how fragile life is and how young he was and how loved he was and how successful he was and how from afar like a lot of celebrities it just seemed like he had everything you could ever want like and obviously you know like a lot of that is an illusion I think no matter how they were celebrity you are how much money you have how all right no matter how much money you have how good looking you are how many people love you that youre that everyone is still just a human being and human beings all have similar struggles and similar demons that they have to confront so yeah so its a I guess Im just me end it there in todays video theyre very very sad that Mac Miller passed away

ok Ill see you I dont know what Id do without that guy you know I almost got it set up but like its like 32 by 9 aspect ratio or something and this gonna happen or should I just give up no its done I did it it should work but the resolution is fixed the game will look epic on this obnoxious like you cant even you cant see the whole thing in one glance alright let me explain whats going on this is like this is a sponsored video were doing a project with EA around battlefield 5 which is launching soon wait is the game gonna fill the whole screen it should shut and were in were in the open access right now multiplayer 5 days left ok lets say anything were doing a big project with them but right now were just gonna try to get the game of work but also I just realize you dont have speakers in here let me get speakers let me get speakers Rael Im in a proper game right now you just die youre logged into my my account you want to try a terrible gamer Im the worst gamer Ill see you Ill see you so where it gets really into work gets really interesting is over in 368 looks like a storms are brewing out here Music I just uh I just wanted to sit up here for the the Vantage so you get a better look of what this space looks like so heres what were doing we are building down here not like a proper tournament space because we dont have the real estate for that but were building for for Saturday for tomorrow just like a four person kind of like practice space and ultimately well build this out so its an eight or sixteen person practice space or gaming space down here but for Saturday were racing to do a four person gaming space game and because were working with EA directly on this theyre bringing in a couple of gamers were gonna be streaming from down here itll be the first time the 368 gaming space is used and because this is like sponsored by EA and were doing this with EA its a its a big thing I think theres gonna be 64 different gamers on a single server all over the world though and well all be competing against one another which is cool but whats even cooler is the fact that were doing it out of three six eight the hard part of all this is getting this space ready by Saturday Music this is all gonna be linked below but if you want to follow along the streams me Saturday at 1000 am California time which is 100 pm New York time where its all below in the description Music what day next week is the activation it would be good is if you like give me a tattoo for this scene as Im talking about okay all right so all right so this is the three six eight store right here this is where like last weeks video you saw me in here selling t shirts weve been working hard to open this space and were going to open it to the public I think one day next week we have something called the sidewalk permit which means its kind of expensive you have to pay for days wheres new one day Ill let you know what day and on that day in addition to like selling whatever crap we can come up with Jeremy here is going to set up a tiny its more of an art installation but like a tattoo parlor right here in this window right so yeah tattoos okay so let me explain how it works its really good okay Jeremy every time okay so heres how it works Jeremy is gonna make a selection of drawings like his little drawings and then we have a website Ill link it is it alive Ill link it below you like go on there you look at his drawings and then you sign up to come get attached it all tattoos are 100 bucks even because that just seems right you can only pick one of Jeremys drawings do you pick where it goes no they can pick where it goes no face tattoos right no face tattoos no face unfortunately you only do a couple a day but its still dope yeah itll be fun and then secretly not secretly like today when youre seeing this video three people today as like as youre seeing this video can come in and get a tattoo Ill link the site below Im sure theyll already be three dudes lined up but like thats the plan and again its not about turning three six eight into like a tattoo parlor Jeremys just a rad street artist rad tattoo artist and were like Music tomorrow notepaper youre gonna be behind here and you even have a peanut gallery out here watching you tattoo is that cool you know last week I made a video about ambition and doing too much and not knowing when to say no and its just like last night we did that serious lightly last night we did that Taco Tuesday which was a small deal but it was also a big deal too as a first and then even tomorrow Jeremys a little tight to experiment again a small deal but its a first and then next week were opening up the space to the public thats a first this thing were doing with EA and Battlefield five on Saturday tomorrow thats a first and all of this is culminating like all this is happening at the same time that Candice just keeps like inching closer to the due date the baby is doing like I think for four weeks in two days right now its just a lot and I couldnt be more excited I couldnt be happier I think the feeling right now is one of being totally overwhelmed and I think the only thing you can do when you feel overwhelmed is just keep going and thats the plan whats good Music,122.77397260273973,unfortunately,0.0,1.0,Hlwy_EK3Mjs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlwy_EK3Mjs
we had a Creator PARTY AT 368!!,2018-09-06T16:37:19Z,8.9,1116874,37486,Frannies like theres a big mouse coming Music today is a day of firsts three six eight well todays the day of one first todays a day were doing something at three six eight for the very first time thats what Im trying to say we still havent figured out like a lot of the details when it comes to how we want to activate the community here at three six eight and thats largely because we still dont really have permission to open this place up yet but Im were doing a little thing tonight we just invited some friends by were calling it Taco Tuesday even though today is a Wednesday and cook dinner tonight we brought in special guests Mike and Joshua brothers green so what are you gonna give me the rundown all right weve got a lot of things so were doing Mexican feast its not like the best tacos in the history of right now are you doing vegan or would you and me both Music weve got were making a cashew sauce here weve got these so were doing a short rib or in salsa fresh slaw right here guacamole salsa verde got a salsa Roja right here its going on so heres the heres the most important question hows the 368 kitchen awesome cuz theyre the first to break in Music Thank You Jo for sending me these gummies I just hate six packets of them I feel a little like Im gonna go ahh part of three six eight probably the aspect of three six eight that Im most excited about is what were calling like the incubator side of the company an incubator like a technology incubator is when is when like a founder somebody with an idea becomes part of this this organization called an incubator and theyre that individual is given resources and access to information and gets networking opportunities and given the tool to take his or her idea and learn and figure out and take it from an idea to a company a YouTube incubator would effectively be taking like a aspirational youtuber somebody who wants to be a youtuber and taking them from wanting to be a youtuber and helping them to become a youtuber and I think three six eight or companies like three six eight could be all over the world and they could be these these entities were in people who have dreams of becoming a youtuber can solicit resources and become part of something bigger than just themselves and ultimately realize their ambition now were were still a long way from being there but a great way to start is by doing little get togethers where similar minded creators can chitchat with one another get to know new people discuss ideas and let things snowball from there so in the long game I hope 368 becomes that and thats our ambition but for right now I mean for literally today were just having like a some tacos tonight so people can just try to get together we can chitchat super casual its not even its just like its just a couple of my friends from the city but it is kind of the first time weve invited anyone by three six eight okay I got to go see Minnie Mouse Music no quick work interruption today its fashion week in New York City this week and I was invited to this fashion event that somehow involves Minnie Mouse so I asked if I could bring Freddie they said yes Candace and I are doing that now its a big surprise for the little girl shes you know sort of freaked out how you feeling if I go you dont look that big weve arrived at the Minnie Mouse fashion event its called mini style were waiting on the Queen herself Minnie Mouse to come out Francine is not a shes not super patient Music what this looks like bodega wheres Minnie now a truly lovely affair in there but we have yet to see Minnie Mouse and Francine is on the verge of completely losing her whats up Im so sorry I havent made Taco Tuesday intro but next week when Im back yall probably went wont do it next week either it may be the week after that Music the taco nights just getting started in fact its barely started but apparently weve got a birthday topping and theres alcohol which was something amazing Music Music Music it went extremely well yeah received I think that it kind of brought back the memories of the underground catering we did thats like wait we dont have to just like get people tacos instantly its bringing back good class you work I appreciate you thank you Music babys kicking dont push you dont realize your own strength oh my goodness that was disgusting Oh God I mean thats beautiful but its also thats disgusting honey what did you think of the first ever 3680 Taco Tuesday very good but there was a lot of tequila I just think there werent there was not a lot of drinkers Im not a drinker yeah you know you can have some beer people always crack open a can of beer okay thank you for maybe some sangria okay we had margaritas that did okay Music Music,101.23595505617978,opportunities,0.0,1.0,BBc3pd0GJG0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBc3pd0GJG0

this was a BAD idea,2018-09-01T16:48:01Z,9.366666666666667,2525007,73560,Wow Ill take a shirt okay great good time for you I guess I see what a smaller Music this behind me may look like a crime scene of some sort this is no crime scene at all just bluebloods the TV show is that a fake hot dog stand everythings fake how you doing hey doing good big fan dude I think youre awesome nice to me is there any film in your camera no its a prop dude hows the investigation some fake Mercedes shooting some fake dude I guess it looks hard hi dude I cant walk past this line because I have like official gear oh no this is what you call a picture car thats not a real compliment but to have a picture car like this in New York City nians there has to be actual cops nearby just in case someone gets confused I think the real cops are over there I cant tell though they dont look real hot pretzels drop hot dog buns a million reasons to love New York City but like skateboarding into work and going buy a movie set like that just makes it I dont know just remind you how amazing this city is this is my new necklace this is my new amulet highly fashionable yesterday I was out of town on a shoot on a big shoot that was awesome somebody came up to me on this shoot and they said part of the reason why I moved to New York City was because I was watching your vlogs theyre watching my vlogs and all of the time lapses and all of the footage of New York City is what convinced them to move here that exact conversation I have at least once a week if not more so its been a little while since Ive uploaded and rather than explain why I havent uploaded I thought I would share with you kind of what Ive been thinking I wrestle like on a daily basis I wrestle with like existential thoughts like what is the point why am i doing everything that Im currently doing and TV little context of that its like Ive got a grown kid I got a little kid not to have another kid is YouTube channel this office my company got my running which is just crazy why do I run so much my loving wife why do I wake up every single day before 500 am what am i chasing and the answer is I dont know and this isnt like some emotional cry for help I am extremely happy Im happy right now Im a happy person Im Im grateful for everything that I have Im appreciative of what I am and and how I got here theres very little that I take for granted but I want more I want to do more I want and I want and I want in Y like where does that come from a B C they always BBC closing always be closing always be closing one of my one of my favorite creators one of my favorite people Ethan Klein hes like taking some time off right now and he posted that hes taking a little break because he felt like he was chasing something instead of appreciating what he had I really like that I think its poetic and thats beautiful see yeah ambition ambition is both a curse and a blessing its a blessing because without ambition youre just kind of treading water its ambition that makes you swim to places you could never imagine its ambition that takes you everywhere you would ever want to go but its a curse ambition is a curse because its not getting to that destination its not achieving what you hope to achieve that satiates are satisfies your ambition its the actual chasing its the do ambition is only like the imaan sterlet ambition is only fed if youre constantly spoon feeding it the doing not the accomplishing so every time that someone whos really ambitious tries to stop youve stopped feeling satisfied the curse that is ambition always demands more and I dont think that everyone is cursed or blessed with ambition I dont think that like ambition is this universal North Star so that brings me back to KC the existentialist whats the point what is the universal North Star whats the one thing were all chasing after and I think like in my heart I genuinely think that one thing that we are all pursuing in life is happiness happiness is the point happiness is the ultimate accomplishment its what we all want or its at least what we all should want happiness and and happiness doesnt just manifest as a product of ambition but it can come from love or it can come from calmness or it can come from whatever is a sense of fulfillment what in life gives you that and then thinking that through like what makes me happy I you know my family makes me happy my running makes me happy wait yep before 500 in the morning makes me happy and feeding my unrelenting ambition with work makes me happy so here I am back in the office doing one thing that makes me happy my North Star which is my work which is making video and that that kind of brings me to the next thing that I want to share with you so this morning for the first time in the history of ever we took all the white frosting off of the windows of the 368 retail store and now you can see it Music Applause Music Applause Music now technically were not supposed to open the doors yet were missing something called a crowd control permit but considering theres no crowd outside I feel like its okay we dont really have any of the products we looking to sell yet

MAVIC 2 PRO + ZOOM vs. MAVIC 1 - is it worth the $$$ ?,2018-08-23T15:59:42Z,11.05,2364337,51716,Music Applause Music every once in a while here on tech review Tuesday we get a special package a special product that is yet to be released to the public we check it out first today is such day Im aware that today is Thursday not Tuesday but we couldnt open these on Tuesday because there was a press embargo these are the accessories Pro 2 1 Matic pro 2 2 all right so we have the two new Mavic pros here this is the Mavic 2 pro the pro has a big fat warning sensor on it that means better image quality better low light better color better everything this is the Mavic pro 2 zoom this ones got a 24   24 to 48 millimeter optical zoom lens okay now for the Music all right so before we get into the flight test of these drones I just want to talk about how I actually judge drones drone quality etc so youve got two axes youve got the quality how good is the picture that it yields anywhere from okay to top notch versus the price expensive less desirable cheap everybody wants cheap this is the sweet spot here you want a cheap but top quality drone so you start with something like this spark here the spark is the spark is 399 dollars which is very cheap but the quality the quality is just about okay so the spark I put right about there then theres the folding maverick air and the Medicare is improved quality slightly more expensive Ive put it right about there the original Mavic it has absolutely stellar quality and its not that expensive at 999 I put it right about there this thing at best quality for consumer marketing drones that DJI sells quality is all the way over here but they start at 1500 and they go up from there depending hours control are you getting all that chest so theyre more like here now testing the maverick to zoom and then a b 2 pro the price puts them well the price puts them right in the middle here and the quality is to be determined but obviously Id love to see it right right around here so were heading to a prime drone flying area where theres lots of things to look at and we can fly there legally Justin why can we fly in Coney Island legally 20 islands outside commercial airspace Class B so its just outside of JFKs like no fly zone or whatever just another reminder to always respect the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration right yeah you got it thats exactly right so we are here at New York Citys Coney Island seem like the prime location to test Music Music my first time flying the zoom having a zoom lens especially one in the air lets you do things that otherwise would be impossible with the drones one of the cool things though is its letting me do it live so like or automatically so I go 48 millimeter I swipe up to 24 and it automatically zooms out or in so the implementation its very good I mean very good for a beginner for sure its more expensive it does have guys Hasselblad one inch sensor on that that means like a bigger better camera that should yield better dynamic range better colors better low light better kind of everything Music that is the regular Mavic in Mavic one were gonna fly all of DJs legacy drones now to compare the image quality between the old drones and these and these two new drones Music Music Music Music yeah Music Music Music have you been out here yet I had a hot dog yeah you told me that we were gonna eat hot dogs now no hot dogs no hot dogs we gotta go back hot dog is not sitting well at all ah as someone whos super fluent with consumer and prosumer level drones having looked at the footage that these things yield I am not surprisingly but I am extraordinary impressed with what theyre capable of the pro in particular has amazing dynamic range in just this camera that theyve managed to put on here is just an extremely impressive camera and thats hows the chicken game away from the nomadic zoom if I had to guess I would say the zoom yields a very similar image to the Mavic one but that zoom feature is extraordinary and personally I think that this zoom is going to be my new go to number one drone this this will be the drone that lives in my camera bag this will be the drone that I travel with this will be my new drone so what that means for my my chart here I take the Maverick to pro at fourteen hundred and forty nine dollars and I put it I put it right about here the quality is top notch the price is still a little bit expensive but the Mavic to zoom that zoom feature the quality is top and the price considering what it does the closest drone to the sweet spot of any drone Ive ever used and I would say that DJI with these two latest releases once again shows that when its time to buy a drone its not do you buy DJI drone its just which DJI drone Dubai Music if I am gonna complain about one thing though it says the old nav Achaemenid that never really stayed on there well and its kinda well Im kind of unhappy to

Dear NYPD,2018-08-17T18:10:56Z,8.933333333333334,2053356,66118,my real work to do youre gonna do good video work today youre gonna do good video work today good boy Music Music ten months ago a Batman throw this part on the bike path right here and he killed eight people and injured others to make sure no one would ever be able to drive a car down the bike path again the city of New York and the NYPD but these concrete barriers all along the bike path make sure no car could fit in thank you to the NYPD thank you to the city of New York for taking these measures to keep us safe I as a cyclist and someone who uses this path appreciate it very much but and its been nearly a year since these blocks here were put into place and while they are effective in preventing cars from driving through here they do make it dangerous for cyclists and runners and people walking on this path to trying to get in and around this used to all be open for traffic to your both ways but now you see theres a small opening here a slightly larger when theyre a tiny one there that shes coming through and then two smaller ones here in this particular case that the things blocking the road take up about 90 of the of the path itself and here this corner here is just a confusing mess if someones coming around the corner on foot and then you got a biker or a runner coming this way well its just begging begging for an accident Music these things for example seems like they could stop a car and they still enable fights to kind of move around and they seem like a really good kind of permanent solution or Music these things youre also great look no cars again through this and you can still get your body curved skateboard or whatever get around them really easily so maybe you can put something that looks like this in place of these terrible things so in conclusion I appreciate you I appreciate all the efforts made to keep us safe in the city but maybe we could maybe get rid of these things and put in a put in something thats a little bit safer and a little bit more permanent of a solution I cant begin to tell you how many times Ive nearly injured myself on these and I cant imagine Im alone thank you Music exit flags not that kind of flexing I do want to do a little flexing though because theres something that Ive been waiting for all summer long Im really excited about it and I want to

DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE.. running 4 marathons in a 7 days,2018-08-14T15:33:59Z,10.9,1785939,65960,nice work thats both right there you got this honey how did you do that this has to be some sort of gender record mind over matter all right babe Music Applause thats how my long naps its been real Music Oh summer is nearing its unwelcomed end and for those of you who know me at all you know that I get severely depressed and turned into a total freakout monster at the end of the summer on top of that Candis is getting more pregnant every minute of every day and her ability to move is dwindling so we decided this past weekend that we would go out to the beach shoe today is Friday and we are taking a little family trip to the beach for one day we come back tomorrow Francine are you excited what are you most excited about Candice is getting snacks right now whats taking Bobby so long she doesnt know well have to see we are about two hours into the drive Im no longer allowed to drive because Im a terrible driver so Im in the back of the kid how much further franciene whats that thing called no a windmill look theres the ocean were at the beach hey we made it is the hotel were staying at we leave tomorrow is kind of a lot of driving for one night thats okay Francine and Candice hurry up there I carry this stuff Im not on the dad Music yeah thats four days almost over but Im gonna go for a little swim in the pool before the Sun sets I know this is shaping up to be a great vlog it but well we woke up the next morning Applause Beach tripping our raindrip the rain never stopped ended up just being mommy daddy and Frannie hanging around in a hotel room for 24 hours it was lovely but I thought I would use this opportunity of having a failed episode to share with you a kind of a story okay this is it if 48 more and I got it wait 47 more and I got it so believe it or not I love to run and I dont know Ive been whats why I get these sort of freak outs Im getting so old Im 37 I start to feel like an old man I dont know it probably is irrational but I wanted to challenge myself to see what I was like see what I was capable of to see where I far I could push my body because its just gross out and my shoes are wet but for miles nobody Ill sleep through this and I think unless you test yourself you dont really know what youre capable of so you know I run a lot I run like 40 50 60 miles a week which is a lot of miles in a week and I wanted to give myself a real challenge so a marathon is 262 miles so three marathons would be 70 what is 262 times three so three marathons is seventy eight point six miles so I thought why not try to do in seven days from Sunday until Saturday in seven days try to run the equivalent of four marathons that is 104 point eight miles in order to do this it means running about 15 miles a day which is a lot this is kind of tough its late were on vacation this weekend its like 1000 at night the kid just went to sleep now 213 this morning but if I want to get across that threshold I gotta get in at least five more right now which means that when we have to do 14 more tomorrow no 19 more tomorrow got to do it it was I think the hardest part of giving yourself such a stupid challenge was finding the time see I saw the kid and the pregnant wife at home I still have a job I still I still uploaded five videos last I had to figure out how to run a hundred and five miles in addition to living my normal life and it was a lot to do these late night miles are so tough everybodys like out partying exhausted its 1045 now Im glad Im clocking miles Im like stacking chips right now those miles are just piling on you know Im 37 years old and like this leg here this is all made from titanium because of a motorbike accident like 10 years ago and Im not supposed to be running and I dont stretch and look oh I cant even touch my toes Ive broken half the bones in my body Ive got a lot of problems but for whatever reason I have like a broken chromosome where I can just run I never got tired my legs never got tired my lungs never got tired my stomach never got tired the only thing that would happen every single day is that run out of time Candice would be caller I have to get to work or a meeting or something like that that was hugely positive you like driving old car cause its 37 years old and then you like hit the gas and it just goes for us youre like my car still works my cars still worse Music no rain pouring right right now rain is not an excuse you know run right through it okay 104 point eight miles got it my wife made fun of me she called me a sociopath maybe a psychopath I dont remember very well Franny all right kids this is it four more miles and I will have done it its almost like carrying a child to be their birth so proud of you Im really glad I did it and I think that in weather something silly like how far can you run or anything else in life it was a reminder for me of the importance of challenging yourself you know challenging yourself doesnt always have to be climbing a mountain or running around the world theyre doing something wild and ambitious but for me it was just about putting out my sneakers and getting out there and seeing what I was capable of physically and for that I think my biggest takeaway was just a greater appreciation of the fact that I am extremely lucky to be 37 and have a body thats capable that lets me do what I want to do where I can still do these kinds of things it makes me want to eat better and dont eat better and sleep more I still dont sleep that much and just be more responsible with my body because its something that I hope to never lose Music all right thats like five and a half miles I think that puts me at a hundred and five point one or something for the week which means victory is mine I did it four marathons seven days 105 plus miles all right thats it I did it 105 miles I want to end this by saying I want to say this publicly I want to say this on the record I want you to hold me accountable for this my next self imposed completely unnecessary challenge is going to be to run seven marathons in seven days thats like 160 miles in seven days but a marathon a day for a week I want to do that sometime next couple years hold me to it were going home tonight but we came all the way to the beach to go to the beach rain or shine were going to be ready Music ah all right Ill see you tomorrow after my ride Music you,120.36697247706422,appreciation,0.0,1.0,dZ27wm2JGqA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ27wm2JGqA

the note 9 yet Ive got two of them thank you Samsung I will do the notes my favorite phone bTW I will do a proper review of this thing as soon as they say this is Im allowed to or whatever or I have a chance to play with it but mostly I just wanted to come on here and mostly blue most I just wanted to show you that I got it I was told not to leave the office with it look very exciting you can count on me to do a full slightly biased review of this thing as soon as Ive had a chance to really play with it they announced it today so I just dont even know whats new and whats different with it but so Janice and I have been doing our marriage counseling and going to a therapist to always improve our marriage and make sure you know were being the best spouses we can be and as the husband of a to a

outside with a mop and a bucket and the bucket was filled up with dirty water and he was painting the outside of his sign trying to make it look like it was like a New York institution when reality he

ARE THESE $1 Electric Scooters GOOD or DANGEROUS?,2018-08-08T19:02:47Z,10.316666666666666,2183353,55937,Music Applause Music three six eight is coming at you from Los Angeles California today I always stay on the beach or at the beach or near as close as possible to the beach when Im in California because its California and theres theres a beach here now this trip Im out here super quick trip Im out here to do a shoot this morning my call time is in three minutes and its for Kevin Hartz YouTube original show called what the fit I watch the show pretty great show its Kevin whos like a crazy fitness guy and then he tastes like a friend of his somebody who knows and they do some sort of fitness activity together so thats thats this morning I think thats the production there well I pay you okay thank you okay thank you Music which is my trailer thank you this is what a Hollywood movie trailer looks like this is my trailer and theres one important thing you should know about snacks think about these big shoots versus like youtubing there are so many moving parts here theres always like somebody is nice to make sure you dont screw up look at all these snacks Music yeah good because the days about to begin Kevins taking a picture with the opposed to the fire chief here and then we go oh yeah its like the vlog yes the vlog before you sir I need to know before we get started what do you need to know you need to know a first and foremost have a good time be have a good time okay see last but not least be yourself and have a good time the word on the street you just got like ten million ten million subscribers that sort of person got to teach me to teach the UT excuse me to youtube link leave this camera in here get this straight Music and thats a wrap it was great a great day I had a lot of fun its always interesting being on sets that big because theres like so many people and so many good snacks and so many cameras and cameramen and its the exact opposite of a production of a vlog where its just like me one camera Ill edit it tonight and post it tomorrow so Kevin Hart it was amazing working with you amazing getting to know you a little bit I appreciate you and now a very special tech review Tuesday this tech review Tuesday is more about service than a product you can rent these little scooters its kind of like uber for scooters you like get the app you push the button and then you just find one of these things and jump on love it here come here heres exactly how these scooter services work Music first you download the app and its just like the uber app or anything else yeah putting your credit card number and some other oh they have you scan the front and back of your drivers license which I dont know kind of creeped me out but I guess I understand why its necessary then once you jump through all those hoops you open the app and theres like a little QR scanner and you have to scan right here how do you stand it the scooter like beeps or whatever you get on and then you have an electric scooter for as long as you want   scooter companies here ones called bird and ones called line this ones a line scooter whats the difference between a lines for the one its faster straight up faster birds or slowest like birds are pretty much is like the bird I just mean my dad just gone on its pretty cool though Id say yeah it says your line s electric scooters require one dollar to a lock and they charge you by the minute as you ride rates and promotions may vary across different rates so that doesnt tell me how much of all right so I dont know exactly how much these things cost I couldnt find that information online but what I read is its like about five bucks every half an hour it just depends so they charge you by the minute and the rates are fluctuating five bucks you know what do you think Im in awesome really good theyre everywhere you use them often in like fourth time using em I use them in San Diego like yesterday are you drifting your scooter Music its not really a nice garage to boot the board all right so my my final thoughts on the scooter situation this is for both the lime scooters and the bird scooters Im of two schools of thought here one is that for somebody who needs transport to get around theyre amazing you just jump on you go they get you there but for everyone else whos not using the scooters they kind of make the city a like a messier place to be theyre not pleasant the whole idea seems very half baked its a half baked because yes great way to get people around its part absolute chaos because like the aspect of where you keep these things and how to not get them in everyones way and just myriad other sort of logistical parts feels totally like no consideration but ultimately I think theyre good because I use them and I I think there are very interesting glimpse into a future where like its not required where theres like a shared transport that doesnt require a car or a bus and its awesome its awesome hey max what do you think of the like bird scooters and the lime scooters scooters in general I think there are menace to society and they need to be stopped at all Carly no I mean I get whats cool about them but like as someone who lives around here theres so many times were like Im just walking out of a store or like my dog is running out of a store and a scooter like almost runs him over or me and like theyre just tourists who have no idea what the hell theyre doing here and theyre like theyre veering off the path theyre going the wrong way down the bike path I mean its just its its a mess its a mess its dangerous someones gonna lose an eye and its all gonna be over Music all right so we spent the last 30 or 40 minutes I dont know if I should have been doing this or Im gonna get in trouble for doing this but I was sharing with max the rough cuts of the Shawn Mendes documentary so he gave me some meaningful feedback because its still a work in progress all right broadly what are your thoughts I think that this is the best video Ive ever seen case you made are you saying let me say that a different way okay okay this is are you both know I

i'm not good with this stuff,2018-08-07T18:02:00Z,10.416666666666666,1391368,63297,so this is not like a regular episode this is more like me sharing a story with you that I want to share with you its not that its like sad sad but its not a super happy or fun story I just wanted to give you forewarning if youre expecting like a fun jubilant blog just come back tomorrow but if you want to hear this more kind of sentimental I guess a little bit a little bit sad of the story well then youre in the right place but this does start out fun it starts out being a fun episode so here okay so this was like a week ago this is before Dan left for South Africa thank you very much see you later be okay Im just leaving town and I thought maybe I should bring you something is it donuts its better ah dude get well then Ill see you in a couple of days so today is a road trip day Ive got a very very long like what is it six hour leave six hour and 32 minute drive from New York City up to Vermont where my grandmother is not funeral funeral is instead of a funeral shes having the whole family get together to celebrate her life and theres gonna be like 30 or 40 of us there so Im sad but Im also very excited to see my family when Im not excited about is this dry its kind of a bummer that Franny and Candice didnt come I understand why they didnt want to sit in the car for seven hours it was smart Candices its too pregnant way too pregnant to be in the car and then nobody I didnt have anybody else to go with me so today is a day of solidarity focused in and sitting in my car watching it drive me to Vermont there it is so now Ive got about 40 half an hour 40 minutes to kill the shopping mall actually Im buying a tie for the funeral Id neglected to bring one so this is fortuitous stop Music quick bite to eat now I think the car is probably close to charge Im back in the car getting it washed I got a full tank of battery Ive got I had a food Im good Im ready to drop is awesome Im ready to drive there is one tiny little concern though it is way way further than I thought I mean not like a little bit for the like significantly as in its 9 oclock at night Ive been driving with traffic like six hours Im not even halfway there long story long I got a long long night of driving ahead of me Music that was kind of all I shot of the whole weekend of getting there see I got to the hotel where my family my whole extended family was staying we got there like 100 in the morning I saw my sister we shared a room and I just I decided at that moment that I wanted this trip to be just like purely about being present and being around my family it felt especially relevant because we were there to sort of celebrate the life of my grandmother but I just I didnt pick the camera up again until I left Music thats my sister there thats me and my sister so the reason why I wanted to make this video or just what I kind of wanted to share for posterity was my take away from this whole from the whole funeral from the whole family get together see we woke up the next morning if we went to the cemetery in the whole sad part and then and then that night we had this is the night of the funeral we had this big like dinner get together in a room its sort of like a wedding reception is what it felt like and after we all finished our lasagna one after another my aunts and my uncles and my cousins they all kind of started to stand up and tell stories about my grandmother thats my grandmother and that thats my grandfather thats my mom and thats her mom my grandmother my grandmother my Nana kept a journal of every day of her life and so many your stories shared from my aunts and uncles were directly from that journal they could go back to literally any day in her life and and recall what happened thats my thats my thats my grandmother thats my uncle Im not sure which one am i laughter that is thats me again my mom her side of the family my maternal side of the family I had eight aunts and uncles or seven Anse and uncles in one mom so my mother is one of eight kids these are them thats seven of them anyways I think thats my mom right there thats my uncle my uncle yeah I I knew that they struggled like my mom always talked to us about how they had powdered milk when they were kids because they couldnt afford like regular milk that comes in a jug they would buy powder and mix it with water and that was the milk that they got Music then my aunt started reading off journal entries and there was a couple that were short and theres a couple that were like I went to bed hungry tonight because we all the kids ate because we only had enough food for the kids or there was one that was something like feeling terrible I didnt have enough food for Lee that was her husband my grandfather maybe tomorrow will be different there were there were a lot of those kinds of moments that just painted such a vivid portrait of what of what my grandmothers life was like like raising eight kids and its hard for me to imagine this whatever was 50 years ago 60 years ago but it just that night there would the family made it so real and so palpable I dont know its weird I was felt more affected by my grandmother than in those moments that I did in my whole life of knowing her and physically being around her Music the model my dad and my brother and cousins and no no no that guy is cousin cousin and cousin theres Nana right there thats me with my cousins and my brothers this is where I lived in a in a trailer park see I live like I think I think right there and thats my grandmother thats my mom thats my dad thats me and thats my baby boy Owen hes big now but thats always Music I know I got up to say something I didnt have a fun anecdote from my grandmothers life but when I stood up I just wanted to thank her and acknowledge how special of a thing it was that her the last thing she did on earth before she died was to set aside the money and the resources and everything to have the whole family come together like this amazing trip was her doing and what a special special thing that was to have to have to have us remember her by it was special Applause Music Music well I made it back great trip of really just amazing time with the family Music Music

occupying me so here goes number one very very very good news I am typically not an emotional person but this news makes me want to cry a little bit I found this out last night for the first time in my whole life I am now an uncle yesterday there was a new addition to the nice stat brood a beautiful healthy baby and everyones doing great and its very exciting thats been like this little dopamine thing in my brain all day thats just like happiness happiness happiness number two and I dont know how to feel about this I guess Im like okay I shared with you like a week ago or two weeks ago about my grandmother passing away which is really just sad and a real bummer but this weekend instead of a regular traditional funeral the entire family the extended family is getting together up in New England like six hours from New York City I feel okay about it because while its very sad it her not being here is very sad and her passing was very sad but the act of celebrating it as a big family is very positive and I do feel good about that so thats number three this is just straight up bad very bad news last night Dan was in a pretty bad accident hes hes fine not life threatening and he broke his shoulder Ive spoken to him he called me last night to tell me even though he cant move his arms he still wants to smack it I dont know what that means so hes okay but its still bad he was

10 Million,2018-08-03T23:36:51Z,7.783333333333333,2096459,116325,Music ten mil its a super big deal I mean ten million subscribers ten million god you know I I when I started on YouTube the idea of 10 million seemed absolutely infallible I mean 10 million subscribers 10 10 million thanks guys I I just wanted to make this quick video to acknowledge 10 million and just to talk for a sec you know this isnt I I cant make a real video right now Ive actually taken a little bit of time off from YouTube so Im dealing with some kind of heavy personal right now but I did want to talk about 10 million what it means getting to getting to 10 million was absolutely not as hard as getting to a million you see between a million and ten million it just meant doing more of the same little bit of patience and a lot of hard work getting to getting to a million get into a million was not as hard as getting to a hundred thousand subs I saw the work people were responding to I made more of that I experimented I worked on building an audience I did all that and it took me from 100k to a million see getting to a hundred thousand subs was still not as hard as getting to ten thousand subs you see getting to ten thousand subs is the hardest thing to do on YouTube because at 0 nobodys tuning and nobody cares and at ten thousand it means youve built a meaningful audience so getting from zero to 10 000 finding your footing building a foundation on YouTube was the hardest thing to do and the moral of all this is that I think one piece of advice that people love to overlook especially young people enthusiasts energetic young people on YouTube love to overlook is patience its something that my friend Gary Vaynerchuk talks about a lot but its its required to succeed in anything but especially on YouTube its patience 2010 years they got a decade ago I started my youtube channel how old were you a decade ago like six the other big part of I think the other big part of when I look back at my success and what Ive been able to do on YouTube the other big part has been you the audience and you know I have said before and I stand by this that I I think inspiration is highly overrated I think inspiration is just what takes you from zero to one and then to go from one to ten million is a combination of hard work and luck and all these other factors and I think the word inspire the word inspiration is wildly overused especially in this like sort of yippee social media world about inspiring others and heres an Instagram photo of a concern set arent you inspired but thats not to say that inspiration doesnt play a role so I thought rather than just me sitting here bloviating about inspiring others or whatever I thought that I would share with you someone that I draw like an insane amount of inspiration from someone that I check in on every single day someone that Ive never met I mostly follow him on Twitter and let me just show you this guy all right this is this is Dre Dre represents everything I love about social media Music all right so Dre is a guy I dont know him I just found him on social media but Dres a guy who started I think 79 days ago he changed his Twitter handle to Dre the new me is coming and every day he posts these videos of himself just busting his ass working out to reinvent himself physically and he puts himself out there in a way thats so accessible and and anyway Ill link his YouTube channel Ill link his Twitter below just check this guy out but the reason why Im singling out Dre today is because I think the magic of YouTube the magic of social media is its ability to bring people together and typically the only time mainstream outside whether its news media or any media attention gets shined on YouTube typically its about something negative not something positive but for me it has been that positivity and its been the connectedness and its been the way that YouTube has opened up my world and be exposed to somebody like Dre I would never be able to find someone like him if it werent for social media that is one of my like profound unrelenting love for YouTube and social media comes from all right that thats kind of it ten million uh I made this 10 million t shirt because I think its awesome it says 10 million here in my handwriting and then down here when you flip it up it says we did it summer 2018 and it says it says we not it says we not I did it because I just make the videos this community grew to 10 million because of because of you because of weed thats why it says we its a great shirt it comes in black and white and Im doing a super limited run of these shirts were not gonna make that many but theres this young lady named Mari copening shes 11 years old she was in Flint Michigan I learned about her fundraiser this morning and I did all this research on this extraordinary young lady doing amazing things the hell her community and her most latest initiative here is to help fill up backpacks for kids who maybe cant afford school supplies and according to this GoFundMe it cost four bucks for her to fill up a backpack with all the supplies that youngster needs so for every one of these shirts were able to sell Im gonna donate four bucks straight to her nonprofit shes looking to get to 50 000 shes currently at 28 000 Im hoping that this will push her over the line of course if youd rather donate instead of buy this shirt thats a great idea Ill link that below her link will also be on shop Casey Neistat comm and if theres any chance youre seeing this video mari keep up the good work I I cant wait to vote for you for president someday okay ten million Ill be back very soon once all this personal stuff blows over but thank you for what ten years of support and I have no intention of stopping or slowing down anytime soon Music,143.38329764453962,connectedness,1.0,1.0,zY7_XJ1WUqk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY7_XJ1WUqk
The Logan Paul Interview.,2018-07-27T13:00:42Z,35.36666666666667,5880862,155359,I want to give a tiny a bit of context to this interview I want to explain why did this interview and and how this interview came to be Logan Paul has had an outsized impact on the YouTube community his actions affect the entire community and while this is true of all big creators Logan Paul in in general and the size of his audience have amplified the consequences of his bad decisions there was a sense of shame and embarrassment around a lot of the YouTube community after the suicide forest video and and all the the fallout from the negative press because of the suicide forest video and in the aftermath of that Logan did some interviews and Logan released some videos explaining himself but I know that I was left with a lot of questions questions about his intent and why he did what he did and you know he still has this enormous audience on YouTube what are his plans what are his intentions moving forward so a couple of weeks ago when he contacted me about a documentary hes currently making about his life on YouTube I obviously had a lot of questions but I told him that I would be willing to do the interview for his documentary provided hed be willing to come here and sit with me so I could interview him on my channel and to his credit to Logans credit he agreed and he agreed that nothing would be off limits and he also encouraged me to challenge him he he he wanted it to be an honest and hard interview so those are the circumstances surrounding it thats how it came to be and its now been a full week since I did the interview and to be totally honest I wasnt sure Im still not sure if releasing it is the right thing I I Harbor a lot of self doubt about maybe I was too easy on him I mean maybe I was too argumentative with him the things I hope to learn my very specific intention with this interview was to see if he was sincere about what hes trying to accomplish with this documentary or if the whole thing is just a charade for good PR and now I feel like watching this interview over and over and over I still I dont know I theres a little bit of me that thinks maybe Im enabling Logan he and I have known each other for years weve always been friendly and by putting this on my channel am I now part of the machine to rehabilitate his image its not what I want to do that is not my intention but could this be viewed as that I I dont know so I hope that this interview will help the community better understand why he did the really stupid things that he did and if hes now truthful and sincere about wanting to have a positive impact on the platform the platform that he and his really stupid really terrible decisions and actions did so much damage to so Im Im really seeing and this video is not monetized this video is also not edited this is the entire 30 minute conversation that I had with Logan Paul one week ago so let me start I just want to ask what is this documentary yeah so I mentioned in one of my vlogs and theres been a lot of speculation on what people think it is the doc is not a its not a documentary about how dang hard my life has been this year its about the story of a young man from Ohio a seemingly regular kid being me of course falling into the social medium machine over the past four years building an audience garnering false power through views which equates to money which equates to against success and then essentially losing it all overnight becoming the most hated man in the world in the snap of a finger so the question that the doc answer is how do you recover from that can you recover from that me sitting you with you right now Im in the journey right now with you like will is it possible for Logan Paul to make a comeback or am I going to be a failed youtuber and fall and crawl into a hole like half the world wants me to do is you know just ask directly is this a fluff piece to make people feel better about Logan Paul no no not at all this its its from making content throughout the years I try to be as unbiased as possible and when you say fluff piece like what because like a  video its just like look ride that you should feel bad heres a way to characterize it is the video about how youve learned to better empathize with others or is the video about making it easier for people to sympathize with you um I dont I dont think people should can or will sympathize with me lets be honest Casey like what I did it theres no distracting people theres no well heres what I tried to do and this is why its okay theres none of that its an unbiased objective story that captures how something like that can happen and what what went wrong in my life that I thought that was a good idea because at the end of the day Im the one who has to look in the mirror and say that was my decision and thats thats a hard thing to do is even like hard talking about it right now with you because up until that point in my life I I it was really only winds it was only success it was only consistent growth and and everything was going so well and I got so caught up with my actions being validated by millions of people I forgot to be a human being in that situation and instead decided to be a content creator and thats where I messed up do you its are even in there theres a little even in that response there was like maybe Im being cynical but theres a little whiff of it sounding like you see yourself in some capacity as a victim no I know by no means am I the victim here and I guess its its sort of tough because I want to make it very clear I am I am not the victim here by no means and everything I say I do need to not word it like that because Im Im not the victim what Im not afraid to do though is be vulnerable about this and open up and say by no means by no means I know what I did was disgusting it was it was wrong it was an extreme obviously lapse in judgment like Ive said but by no means am I am I the victim or claiming to be the victim do you would you characterize this is a redemption story its an attempted redemption story is what it is thats it are we still talking about the doc yeah I mean thats what it is thats what like again will I come back I say yes thats what this what the doc is about the story is is it not how long has it been since the yeah is it not is it not premature like it before you can tell a redemption story there has to be an act of redemption true so what is that what is that what is the act of redemption bin for Logan Paul its its not been done yet thats what the doc is about and like again this whole the whole idea of the harlot is crazy fine the whole the whole idea of the doc is like we dont have plans for it we dont plan on like profiting off it if if we if we are gonna monetize it if I dont know I dont know cuz what we want to do Ive told stories my whole life through a lens as have you so the thought process is why whyd let someone else make that story cuz someones gonna want to make that story people have wanted to make that sort why let someone else do it when I could just do it myself and I know that if we do decide to monetize it 100 of the proceeds will go to some sort of suicide prevention awareness program because thats thats essentially what this whole thing is about are you are you a different person now than you were yeah absolutely oh let me follow it up by because Ive heard you say that how have you demonstrated that how have you not just said but what have you done to demonstrate that and are you even sharper in saying that like a lot of your content I think the suicide video that you came out with your first video back no really demonstrated what your channel is capable of and talking about something bigger than just Logan Paul but there hasnt been much since then there hasnt been much thats demonstrated youre a different person you talk about positivity and being a different person and changing the structure of the channel and then it was days later youre shooting a dead mouse so what what had you done to demonstrate you changed as a person the rat the rat was right yeah the rat was that was me becoming obsessed with the idea of being a villain when when the whole world hates you I just I made the conscious decision Im gonna Im gonna be the guy they think I am and I essentially became the architect of my own destruction because I wanted to be who they thought I thought I might as well adopt this adopt this screw it and it wasnt that a direct contradiction to everything you just put out about how youre changing and how youre a different person yeah videos were inside of a week yeah I know but it to me while I can still be a good person Im also still was possibly am the guy who takes things to extremes thats I mean thats thats who I am thats the brand of Logan Paul its the fastest the biggest the best the greatest and but and its not that led you to the I mean thats how you started this exactly I mean thats thats everything is to the extreme right so if I can make content and I have been for four years for four years making people laugh smile believing themselves making them believe that they can accomplish their goals even if theyre from a small town in Ohio because I made these mistakes yes Im going to demonstrate more empathy and more compassion but at the same time I still have my brand and what saw thing to me is that brand of living life on the edge do you understand I I do but I think its sort of a convenient umbrella to hold over everything so I think it its Noble when you talk about motivating people I think its its I think its a noble ambition to want to inspire and motivate people especially someone like how you characterize yourself and coming from being a normal guy yeah but I think that like to use that same to use that same pretext as sort of justification for you know killing a rat or well I didnt kill the rat those circumstances around that video or some of the other more controversial sensational things youve done running around Japan wearing silly outfits yeah so that Union sensitive to culture thats all part of the same I want to address this cuz Im not gonna lie this is the the hardest thing about all this is I think being perceived as culturally insensitive as far as the outfits go they were on sale at a store right next to the temple that we were at for tourists do we not buy the outfits dont know if theyre on sale there and then deeper I mean thats we could dive into the specifics of what happened theres a difference between culturally insensitive and insensitive the brand that I was at the time was just all around insensitive and thats the person who I am no longer trying to become and will no longer represent on the vlogs yeah and you think that that has been the case with your content since that moment till now theres this looking ahead this okay so its its this is looking ahead yes but because youre right its like I said those things and then you go and taser that rat what the what happen did you just contradict everything and the answer is again like you said yes thats why its hard for me because how many times can you say one thing and then try to be a better person but truly now its like Im vegan now I got a girlfriend who is extremely wise and she helps me grow and become the person I want to become my content is focused more on positivity and doing what you want to do to achieve your goals which is all like I said its always been that but all that stuff is overlooked when you make mistake or why sensationalism clouds that its like a an eclipse if if that mission which again I do think is noble but wanting to motivate I dont I dont even want to say it but when a moon comes in front of it and that moon is a moon of sensationalism that is harmful it clouds out a completely black Wow whats whats harmful I mean I think like the general sort of disrespectfulness that comes along with that kind of some true I think that certainly everything that sort of precipitated the suicide forest incident or I think that the you know like the the tasing of the rat and myriad other just kind of the general attitude that you characterize is living on the edge I think really clouds a lot of that much more a much more meaningful in addition of wanting to inspire true but I think this is a good dovetail for a bigger question thats thats that you and I both identify with which isnt like the pressure of being a youtuber of being a daily vlogger of uploading every single day of having to maintain that audience get more views so you can get paid to keep it going the focus on relevancy that focus on the biggest Channel today the most subscribers say like there are pressures that come along with that where you get this tunnel its tunnel vision yet and thats why you know in 2016 I stopped logging I remember you you text me the day I stopped vlog because I felt like I went to a place where I was so caught up in that that I was full of well I was gonna ask you one question I have use have you ever found yourself in a place where you are being influenced by your success rather than your creativity and did that lead to your demise because thats what happened to me I would probably push back at the idea that had a demise but certainly it contributed to my not one I did two daily vlog I stopped an Aston stuff like why am I doing this and I was caught up in that tidal wave and that sounds like I dont wanna do it anymore and its now my work is much more about creative motivation its much less about like I dont care about use fighting for Elephants he doesnt make sense I dont care about that but I do want to back up so I ask this question because I want to understand where your head was before you went into that forest I dont want to beat that dead horse youve said a lot about that youve been open about that but I do want to understand like where was your brain leading where was the thought process leading up into that I talking about the day of like you were riding away that I I think no one in the history of YouTube had ever been on that they havent thats why when I wanted to take you there when I sit here and say that every day we were creating a new piece of content meant to bend the limit push it right up to the edge be entertaining be funny be positive spread a message we got so caught up in creating that we did not stop to think about what we were making and whether or not it was right because it you make it you put it out we were on autopilot essentially which is its its extremely dangerous when youre broadcasting to an audience of five to seven million people every day and so there was no thinking there was it was create content create content create content not okay hey take a step back slow down breathe so the time I would be a human being that meet this mission of wanting to inspire and motivate like do you believe that or is that because if thats if that mission is the same as this this momentum this autopilot wheres the distinction between wanting to do good and wanting to you know looking for sensationalism that will drive clicks Im not Im not sure I understand the question I also do want to say Im not well liked while the underlying mission is always that you can you should you achieve its okay to be different its Im not thats not what my channel is entirely about its a combination of that and it is entertainment its a light hearted comedy essentially thats what it is I just think those two things in conflict with one another essentially yeah and thats why Im a brand thats thats who Logan Paul is because I do bridge the gap between being like a motivational speaker kids and standing on a stage in front of 300 people but also like hey I am a  kid Im 23 years old 22 years old at the time and if I want to go jump out of a plane naked Im gonna do it but at the same time you can work hard and achieve your anybody ever want to do anything anybody ever faulted Logan Paul for jumping out of a plane naked no thats all Im saying but I could give you a list of like I jumped off a bridge into the river in Italy is that culturally insensitive is saying Mamma Mia in Italy culturally insensitive I dont I would argue that its just insensible but jumping on the hood of a car in Japan is and culturally it is yeah jumping on the hood of a car in Japan is culturally insensitive dressed as a pokemons throwing a Pikachu at the car I I absolutely think why do you think thats insensitive well I mean culturally culturally insensitive I think thats insensitive but the fact that its being pinpointed to be culturally insensitive when I do that  did did that everywhere thats hard for me thats hard for me to hear and listen to I mean without getting into too much nuance youre the culture of Pokemon is very much woven into the culture of Japanese culture yeah you were dressed up as a character from a Japanese pop cult you were dressed as a Japanese pop culture sort of icon as Pikachu so like I do think that there is a connection there well but Kasey they sell the outfits in Japan I understand I understand that do you Casey cuz I saw I dont know I dont agree with you but I I dont agree with me I want to make that clear I dont I dont agree with me or think what I did was right Im just saying theres a difference between being culturally insensitive insensitive towards a culture and overall insensitivity which is what the old Logan Paul had an issue with and had a problem with and is now today what Im working to not do ever again I just think you were both of those things okay okay but let me ask you took a month off yeah and talking about that autopilot that mentum and I get that dude I was been have been there how did that month off help you empathize and understand both the criticism coming at you which was like insane never seen anything like it yeah and then how did that like what did you learn in that month off so during the month off it was a lot of meeting talking to visiting Ashley came to New York for a couple days suicide prevention organizations organizations about mental health and finding out what it what it truly is like to have suffered from depression or know someone with depression or even know someone that has died by suicide because that aint its just its just bad cuz this thats crazy Rose New York sorry the sirens here at the office are just unbearable um this is what I had that mother up there okay are you so you can see when theyre passing dude I mean I have hours of footage of me just cursing the world um but continue you tell you you did you invested time in meeting with people yeah and to this day to this day the guy who is uh in my suicide be here tomorrow video at Kevin Hines I text him every single day and we we want to do something together in the in the future obviously Im focused on this fight right now thats my number one mission but the month off was a step for me to once again become a human being and forget about views money success and clout and it was a chance for Logan Paul to be like okay this this this is why this is wrong because I had never been like I said in the video affected my suicide I dont know I didnt I didnt know what it what it means to know some are loose someone who has died by suicide so it was an attempt for me to discover that and once again like I said a million times right now become an actual human being and after after that video dropped I guess its like did did did he give you an appreciation for the cuz that video I think had a very important message behind it was a I like that video I tweeted that I liked that video and Im gonna get for it but did it show you sort of the demonstrate to you that your channel is capable of so much more and your reach is capable and your voice is capable of so much more than just sensationalism views yes but I mean but I I dont want to say I didnt know that I just was doing the wrong thing with with that capability I was I wasnt putting out PSAs like that its its the most viewed suus anti suicide PSA ever and it was groundbreaking for me to realize its it is possible for me to create a piece of content that can change that many lives I will say what we did in that video was the attempt with the forest video beginning middle and end I made it very clear that it is okay to feel ostracized and alone whats not okay is holding those feelings in and that I truly believe quote unquote that every person has a place on this on this earth but we did that in such the wrong way we tried to shock it into people versus showing and demonstrating its my telling and hard to believe that thats what the suicide forest video was about when you guys are laughing and smiling and just the thing that bothered me the most about the video was your excitement exercise you were excited to have found a dead body not not really this is oh this is this is what I watched it that was the emotion that I was that I that I took you from you and your Posse you guys felt like weve got something here thats going to get us views at the beginning of the video is like something youve never seen on YouTube before that is what affected me the most about that video because I understand that mission and I do think your your suicide video really accomplished that but if youre gonna conflate the two then I just have to I have to tell you why I dont I dont I dont agree with that complaint okay okay lets lets I want to hear about I want to talk about the fight what what is the fight youre fighting ksi sorry dude its just it is brothers fight you dont want to move on you dream or you want to know just because yeah the laughing is its a defense mechanism for me thats what it is absurd you say that do you believe it um I believe it when youre saying it but I dont believe that you expect people the eight million people that saw it video for say you know to understand within those contexts that you were just laughing at as a defense mechanism like I think that theres theres intent and and then theres theres actuality and theres a saying its like the the road to hell is paved in intent because if all that really matters is what transpired and what transpired is you and your your peers your friends laughing and snickering and and making light of a human being who had died and I think that your intent in that moment is irrelevant all I see is whats actually transpiring I tried to move on from this and talking about the Box English man I just like I know I just understand its its hard for me to listen to someone to my face tell me that I was laughing at the guy Im telling you how I hired a nurse in my perspective I understand I just Ive met unique no youre not youre not unique you you do represent the voice of the people which is what Im learning to I guess be vulnerable about I just like it was never my intent to come off like I was laughing or joking about Seuss I said suicide its not a joke three times in the video because its its clearly not it I never thought it was I just used comedy when Im uncomfortable or I dont know what to do when theres a lens on me and my actions are essentially being validated by five to seven million people and no one around around me is telling me hey thats not okay I understand that I understand I just excuses never validate yeah truth truth and your answers may be valid but it doesnt excuse the action does not at all and Im like I said ashamed deplorable mistake and the only thing that I want to do right now is show that that video was not a representation of Who I am who I will become and who I want to be I appreciate that we talked about the plate now yeah sure we can talk about these well because hes turned off after 30 minutes keeping an eye on them what is what is your fighting que si what is the true what is the fight ima beat his ass Im a big boxer Ive been boxing for like 12 years I dont like to step into the ring because I dont want to get hit I value my brain too much but just if all I had to rely on was his face love and I wouldnt go very far I need the brain okay okay what is this um why is this happen thats essentially ksi he called me out he called my brother out and I accepted the fight Im always up for a challenge I thought honestly for me having that event happen in January this was a way to step back from the world of YouTube and stop worrying about the views the money the clout all that went down I havent grown on Instagram in six months literally at all and focus my efforts on something else so I can become a different guy this is like the boxing win for me is showing people that even if you fail even if you get knocked to the ground even if if you feel like youre at the lowest point of your life you can get up and do something and still win do you think that the fight is part of the redemption story do you see the finest part yeah yeah absolutely absolutely because its its not about a fight its not about the boxing match itself like I said its about being able to get hit in the face whether theyre a result of your own actions or not in my case they are Im the one who up but Im willing to say ok this is the mistake I made Im gonna keep my chin up Im gonna keep moving forward no matter how many people want me to crawl in a hole and die forever Im not gonna do that you can fail and still come back and still keep on going and still win so youre Jakes Deji ksi theyve been cranking out content every day yeah its like trash talking Ive seen them at the press conference is just being vicious theyve just been non stop and with exceptions it feels like youve been a little bit more reserved yeah including like the press conference in in London where after ksi just really got gnarly with his you know with his with his verbal exchange like he went to a really crazy place you just got up and walked out is this is this you being like frustrated or is this part of the new Logan Paul its the new Logan Paul its I have no interest in bantering back and forth with someone who is the exact person that Im trying not to become and stay away from by degrading woman by going after my family in a in in a manner that is intended to harm hes I dont I dont have any interest in that the goal for me here is to beat him on August 25th not talk about how Im gonna beat him not talk about his family or talk about what Im gonna do to his girlfriend the goal is to win a fight and I just I was over it like I as soon as I walked in the press conference I was like okay this Im just over the top Casey to be honest its all its all Fugazi Fugazi this time to fight this fight words right there um all right and then I I guess like a big question I have for you is like I dont know how to say it up theres a lot of like a lot of YouTube community was upset after a lot of you know the negativity around Logan Paul because they thought you sort of besmirched what it meant to be a youtuber Yeah right rightfully so I guess its like what do you say to that how do you respond to that huh is there a response for that um I mean to my fellow creators like wholeheartedly I mean I apologized already but I am sorry that I I guess brought shame upon the platform is if thats how I want to word it thats why I say I guess is why I have to be so careful were like how I talk but thats thats obviously not the person who I want to become or live in the body Oh for the rest of my life and just like I made a mistake I promise I will do the community well and keep my head up and keep on trucking in ring light to YouTube but obviously Casey its its horrible to see your peers sure and rightfully so because of my own actions like I just felt bad again I apologize for it Ill apologize for it a thousand times I dont want to sit here and be a sob story for the rest of my life so so then and and this will I want to end it with this but I want to ask whats next for Logan Paul but I want to ask within the context of like understanding your resume now has some some some dirty marks on it understand that you you carry this bag its and theres no getting rid of it where do you go from here in the world of me whats your where does where do you want to be in ten years and how are you accomplish that having to lug around these you know these chains forever I think Hollywood I think America in general is its they love Redemption stories they its its a story for me my life is now a story about someone who was winning someone who self imploded and was like I said the architect of their own destruction and struggle and vulnerability and now its being able to say this is a part of my life and I want to become better I dont want to let my mistakes to find me I think a person is defined by how they recover from their mistakes and whats next for me is honestly probably just content creation businesses I can answer this question with a hundred things but all that  matters to me right now is to fight August 25th get your tickets Lincoln bye all right thank you thank you for doing this entire interview without plugging your merge once have a shove BM I do I do appreciate your frankness and I appreciate Logan didnt see any of my questions beforehand I didnt bring any of this up so I I thanks for doing a straight interview yeah of course thanks Casey thank you,165.4665409990575,disrespectfulness,1.0,1.0,4gd0wKc135A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gd0wKc135A
the PAINFUL TRUTH ABOUT 368 (my company.  an emotional video),2018-07-26T14:25:30Z,9.733333333333333,3076005,109703,its its a Music Applause Music whoa like that hot sticky sweaty wet slimy day today in New York City the citys not so fun when its raining up cant do anything the paint stripping gum and it drives the pants pretty quickly fell then one spot for too long my pants will literally catch on fire Music Applause now Id like to have just a little bit of a heart to heart with you if thats up oh whats up I was just about to have like a heart to heart no you saved yeah you look good dad its easy to like brush off bad YouTube comments like people make fun of you people tell you your videos suck people say unsub because I didnt get all that stuff it just rolls off your shoulder when youve made a bunch of videos and have been seeing it for years theres only one kind of comment that penetrates that like and those are the comments that confirm your worst suspicions those are the ones that like that actually speak the truth so I bring this up now because Im always seeing a couple of comments that are like three six eight is bullsh I thought it was gonna be this big thing youre still just making regular videos and sometimes you hang out in there that hurts it really hurts because its not the truth but its also kind of how I feel like I when I first announced three six eight it was this huge initiative and Ive done really nothing as far as you know the reality of it is that building a business is a really slow really painful process and we are working full full full steam ahead and were doing incredible initiatives we have like a youtuber incubator program were gonna bring together small youtubers its very exciting we have like businesses built into it that our early generating revenue we have the three six eight gaming which is happening and then the biggest speed bump at all is this the space 368 at its core as I pitched it all revolves around the nucleus which is this physical space in downtown Manhattan the space still isnt done and were doing everything were throwing money at it weve spent just maybe even over a hundred thousand dollars working on that space like were investing heavily in that space its just not there yet were almost there like look this is what the space looks like today today is July whats the date day this is my live feed from three six eight look it thats literally what it looks like right now like this is the current level of construction in the front space this morning its its can I get an amen amen it looks but it is exciting whats going on down there I do want to take you down now give you an update at 3 6 8 will you want to come yeah man lets go check it out you curious Im a cop right yeah yeah it is hot I think youre gonna if you say its hot I believe you alright lets go lets go Music its good its hotdogs sorry guys were building good stuff so this wow I havent seen the lighting yet so this space out here is gonna be the retail space like this room is open to the public this here is gonna be the sales desk see how its uncomfortably high mm hmm we want it to be really unwelcoming basically like yeah we want people to come up and kind of have the desk come to their chin and then they feel awkward and small yeah just be like intimidation yeah we dont want people to hang out in here so we thought wed make it as unfriendly as possible but thats that this is the creator space back here and this whole space is meant to be modular or really a halfpipe here when my friends come around town theyre like how do I get around New York City and now I can just be like here follow my super 73 as we got 10 of them you have one of these right Applause peekaboo mechanically much Music that whole thing moves again because you just explained the whole business model four three six eight in the most poetic okay okay okay go so its its the Medici family of Florence so they basically made their money in banking and Ive been studying them for about ten years trying to figure out how to build the creative model because this is a family who had Galileo and and Michelangelo and some of the greatest artists of all time dont worry dont worry guys Im dropping gems over here dont worry the the three six eight is very similar to that idea in the structure and so if youre talking about moving to Los Angeles I want us to figure out how we can do something together because Ive been trying to build this forever three six eight west coast but I think right but Moores more whats really exciting is that if we get this right the next Michael it the next Michelangelo YouTube exactly how do we end this how do we end this segment youre not man sometimes you just allow things to gently go their own way you know you dont want to say goodbye you dont you dont want to say so long you just want to like is this just what you do when you dont have an ending for something yeah well hes good hes good hes good you know what this social media thing doesnt work out you should be an actor Music 2006 the year that Will Smiths The Pursuit of Happyness came out you want something go get it period maybe my favorite Will Smith movie ever so this is a story that I told will today but when I first moved to New York City I lived in an SRO like a single room occupancy it was a place had no bathroom and no kitchen was a shared bathroom not a great place to live and I used to ride my bike almost every day like from where I worked all the way downtown all the way up to with this huge heavy bag with like all my camera gear in it and then this camera gear was like this burden it was like this weight I knew that that burden on my back was going to be what set me free like what all my dreams could come true if I just believed in this thing Chris Gardner was doing his best but his fast wasnt enough in that movie invest all this money into these like heavy bone density scanner things and his whole savior like the only way hes gonna be able to make it alive is if he sells these stupid heavy things and hes lugging them around everywhere and like I remember seeing that movie I was like a couple years later and I sort of found my footing and just like bawling my eyes out for that entire movie because I saw so much of myself in that main character as this struggling single father who who knew that he could find his way and and achieve what he wanted to achieve in life for himself and his family and and I and meeting will today like brought that full circle anyway a great movie you should see it if youve never seen it great day today okay really truly awesome to have you by well Im in three six eight with my man Casey in the building so three six eight as an artist Haven is that how you describe it this is well hes our new spokesperson yes new spoiler checks in the mail yes sir

CASEY + AN OLYMPIAN GO RUNNING,2018-07-18T16:44:10Z,8.7,1628600,67631,Music Applause Music you ready are you ready to make this movie yeah Im ready Applause welcome to the long awaited Casey and Robertos guide to running four new runners Im Casey Im an amateur but very passionate welcome Roberto mange an Olympic runner four oh one point seven sixty four fifty five split twenty nine thirty five forty ten Roberto when you land in the Olympics did you metal faced Casey yeah no it was a very competitive race as the Olympics no metal huh no but I mean those are participation medals you know everybody gets them so what were trying to do is like answer questions for really for new runners so we asked people on Twitter to ask us questions were gonna answer their questions and give us an informed as informed advice as we possibly can have you did you run yet today no did you bring here you bring your running bus oh yeah I sure did ah theres a trick to putting on your running clothes I bet you Roberto dont even know this trick okay ready so if you ball up your running clothes like this and then just take them and whoa does that work huh were gonna answer your questions while we run we need the questions were just gonna were gonna do the questions here I think this was a good one too definitely what is your advice for absolute beginners absolute beginners Im gonna go first Im gonna first heres my advice of Eunices how I started running if youve never run before focus on time and time alone so set yourself a goal like can you run for two full minutes two minutes without stopping if you can do to get to four once you get to ten minutes without stopping get to 20 until you hit an hour that took me like four months and I started running good advice spot on just gradual start everybody starts a different place but something where to build up from yeah what are the best shoes what are you running I exclusively run a New Balance that being said theres the shoe out there for everybody no two feet are the same I run almost exclusively in Brooks Im in Nikes today Asics are good New Balance are good and Mizunos good theyre all good its just what works for you because every foot every foots different lucas asks okay Lucas asks how do I stop running away from my problems Im only answering that joke question because I I literally run to get away from my problems like what Im having a tough time running makes me happy Im having problems at work whatever having fights with Candice but Im just getting angry a run does cheer me up I literally run away from my problem thats why I run 70 miles a week thats a great question Music Maron asked what is the difference between running on trails and roads and running on a treadmill and which is better I see no reason to run inside almost ever trail running and running on concrete I personally love trail running I just love getting outside get with my thoughts feel nature and whats the difference like is it better for you um yeah I say running on trail softer surfaces its easier on the joints so a lot of people arent aware that Im running on concrete all the time it tends to beat you up a little bit even if you have proper footwear thats why Im hurt every year well he also runs a lot do you stop for water a lot Jeremy wants to know do you warm up or just go for it you warm up no I just gradually build into it I never warm up if its a short race like a 5k Ill warm up but for my training runs like every day I never warm up I just go outside thank you maximum distance covered in one run I think the most for me if I see the 32 or 34 miles whatever you get lost no I just love distance all right for me I ran 29 miles once by accident I actually got left behind so I had to get home Music Music Music theres one from gand I think it probably a lot of people struggle with but how do you get out there on days when youre not feeling motivated good question remember   what got you want there in the first place what your goals are theres gonna be good days and bad days motivation for me is just like running makes me so happy if I dont run a miserable and thats kind of thats kind of all I need okay ash Ashley wants to know I used to run a lot and Ive fallen out of it any tips for getting back into running cant stop one stop a break here and there its okay but youre gonna make the biggest gains by being consistent in your training so again just try to get out there neither avoid it neither of us had an answer for that question Im not seeing this question here but I want to know from you mm hmm for my own well being do you stretch if Im gonna stretch its gonna be after the run when your muscles are more warmed up before nope definitely not before unless he do a slight warmup run so never stretch cold dont stretch cold can lead to injury goodbye all right last last question I dont think anybody asked it but Im gonna ask it why do you run Roberto great question I like I personally run because is my journey of self discovery I want to find out just how good can I be hit what are my limitations and running is so pure theres no red theres no coach you know so pure yeah you just go out there and you run and you just find out how good can I be thats why I run sweetie Music all right so that that concludes kind of our first arent your leg was touching my leg thats alright well roll with it its just weird when its like two grown men its a lot of leg action its a running movie thats our first running movie I can foresee a lot of people saying but what but I want to know a lot of unanswered questions but Roberto keeps saying like this should be a series and I think hes right so I hope this was helpful yeah we look forward to hearing from you guys I just got to run enjoy the day yeah if youre thinking about running just just run just run keep it simple like we do

i'm so hot.  (dan made me title it that),2018-07-17T20:42:01Z,8.966666666666667,1302845,50965,Music scooted about a loopy scoot whats up Im gonna Graham never settle for less man yo Im saying loopy scoop are you smoking a joint right now so theres this one thing I do in the summertime in New York City and I I think of it all year long and I do it every sunny warm day in the city in the summer and its stupid but its this its not running you already know how happy running mix lets eat five miles from from my house and where I start there are these rocks and I get to these rocks and its hot its like scalding hot like a hot to the touch hot but I just lay here and I just cook and I close my eyes but I just kind of like meditate and think and focus for like 20 minutes maybe its the heat or the Sun I dont know what it is but this is a kind of focus I can never find in life and then when I get so hot I cant take it anymore run five miles home and then I start my day but I start my day feeling like fresher and newer than Ive done anything else I love it I have a cut I have a joke okay go you want to hear the guy who curse I did you hear about the guy who got his left side shot off his list no I didnt hear about the guy got his left side shut up oh its fine hes alright now they save it thats gonna break that thank you Ill see you later all right its tech review Tuesday and I have an idea wait Ive got a question my intro a secret no question mmm in the video that you posted the other day you were like really like sad and upset you were like crying mmm this is me and me being honest but I didnt understand why you were so upset was it really about one video or is there something deeper that you need to talk about I dont know if Im going through a downer either Im up oh Im down this note like theres no middle ground thats just me Im like one of those deeper dudes you know wait are you down right now no Im up I think are you bummed out we like talk if you know were not to make videos no Bria I like to make videos okay so heres my idea since todays tech review Tuesday Dan I was thinking instead of like just reviewing a piece of hardware I have an idea every great TV show uses the same intro to every episode like so I want to have a more consistent intro for this show thats going to be the new three six eight intro and Im going to show you how I do it what equipment I use and thats gonna be tech Tuesday what do you think oh I think its good all right so whats going on right here is we put a cell phone with time lapse mode into this spinny its called a camel app egg timer its an egg timer cost 25 bucks then you turn your cell phone on to time lapse mode you hit record it spins and captures a time lapse its amazing its dirt cheap it looks like Music so that shot light captures New York City it captures the movement that happens here and thatll make up one tiny piece of this new cinematic oh good Im getting on the boosted board okay were shooting something right now thats like a moving time lapse in front of one of my favorite restaurants in New York City Previn here is gonna shoot it hes really good at this stuff and basically I stand still the camera moves around me and its this time lapse but its a really dynamic effect you go to stay behind so now were gonna go get that exact shot in like two or three more locations and stitch them all together so it feels like a 360 all right so were gonna finish the 360 so what we just shot was a 180 around me and now were gonna do the 360 around we were going to do this in front of juice press so it looks like that Kinect on 180 and a 180 and youve got and then youve got a full circle and a juice for Dan Ive gotten to know Casey pretty well and he doesnt do well standing throws this is gonna be kind of hard for him dude am I not in the shot Im pretty sure what do we do we go just now yeah its Ibiza hes a sweat marks from a hard working South African male man you notice theres like a lot of friendly faces in New York City today more than Ive ever seen you Music Laughter talk me through this last effect were going to be doing here so imagine an infinite zoom slowly but then you just chop off the in and out points I dont understand what youre talking about theres nobody I understand what youre talking about so like no no lets just show show it again dad how are you do that getting hit by a car really hes doing a really long zoom zero then were gonna do another zoom down there I start connecting the zooms together so you look like its zooming zooming forever done guys so now we go one block closer do the same shot when we stitch all these together oh its right here okay then looking good okay so this is going to be shot number two shot number two of either three or four to take us like a half a mile down Broadway right to the studio all right so this is three of four Darren green light green light green light Music Laughter its a red light myself it doesnt even matter its a red light Music no okay it is a red light guys having a bad day yeah that guy hurt your feelings yo dude didnt you watch my video amaretti sensitive rude Im gonna go Im gonna have a proper cry can we please I think I think today was a smashing success this intro is gonna be a Dan maced case you know its that collabo Cola collab Im gonna go run youll send me that yeah Ill send it to you tonight accord I call it way to work on the knife you want you want to go run right now definitely but if any I dont have the stupid in it I mean I played I do you dont actually you know I didnt need a second run but Ive been thinking about it all day very happy that I got it in okay and now I present for the first time ever the new Im probably gonna change it but the new intro for the 368 vlog ready in three two one Music you you,134.05204460966542,restaurants,0.0,1.0,lK1SzfgV3zg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK1SzfgV3zg

THE GREATEST COMPACT CAMERA but is it worth $1200?,2018-07-11T14:14:27Z,10.2,1899808,53685,if this video looks and sounds different from my normal videos its because this video this episode of tech review Tuesday was shot almost entirely on the Sony rx100 mark 6 point and shoot cameras see that little guy there normally I shoot on big SLR cameras like whats behind it but today Im shooting the entire episode just on this little point shoot Music hmm pretty cool so Ive been using this camera now for about a week and I can tell you without hesitation it is by far the best point and shoot video camera ever made so this video isnt about whether its good or not this video answers or tries to answer one very simple question is it worth the absolutely insane price tag of 1 200 1 200 for a point shoot cameras okay ah see watch me when I do those feeling fly drinking drogyn with my pot noodles smoker herbs Music as far as specs kill this thing is Music Oh Music Oh kids were great as far as specs go this has all the high end specs that you would expect including 4k this entire video is in for occasion switch it over this is really really great high frame recording or slow motion ready this entire next scene right here was shot on this camera at 240 frames a second is wildly impressive stuff coming from a point ship but theres one main feature of this camera that I want to spend most of this review on and the main feature I want to focus on the main differentiator from this camera from its predecessor this is the mark 5 this is the mark 6 is this new lens on it and this lens effectively goes from like this shout which is about 24 millimeters its a wide angle shot to a crazy 200 millimeters ooh watch this ready still zooming which effectively gives you like a crazy telephoto lens and a wide angle in one camera that will its this size that fits in your pocket thats a huge deal to appreciate that is to appreciate cinematography Music cinematography 101 with Casey at its most basic all shots all cinematography all shots fall into one of three categories first category the close up close ups are great for intimacy or emphasis or you know what you know to close up this the medium a medium is this its like this at 90 of all YouTube videos theyre all shot in media then last last is the why too wide the white is the big shot thats meant to show context it shows where you are this is every shot falls into one of these three categories in any in any movie any TV show youve seen leverages some version of all three of these shots Music this is a huge deal or a huge deal for me for for one big reason and thats that and thats that Im told now to achieve those three different shot categories Ive had to have a camera like this with a wide angle lens that looks like this and then if I want to get those long shots those uh those close ups or those flat shots where the shots that show distance or perspective I had over a long lens that looks like this so I guess the 1 200 question is can this one compact camera replace these three things and that that brings me back the very question that I posed at the beginning of this video which is is this thing worth 1200 I really think in order to consider that question question you have to look at what else you can get for tall under bucks I think budgets for like a YouTube camera set up I think like what can you do for a hundred bucks for 300 bucks for 500 bucks but when you start to get into the 1012 hundred dollar range you can do and buy almost anything for example the cameras I showed you earlier this is a Canon a TD this is their kind of crappy but whatever zoom lens and then this is their super crappy plastic wide angle lens you can get all three of these camera stuffs you can get all three of these for the same price as this point shoot camera see on Amazon you can get the ATD with these two lenses and all other crap for 85 bucks less than this point shoot these three things or you can get this point and shoot camera and I should say for emphasis that the majority of my youtube career was built with this camera and these you can do most anything with this so its hard to imagine why you would invest your whole budget in pointe shoes instead of buying something more dynamic unless your priority is size and compact knits one thing that this camera can do that an SLR cant do Music Music last two features of this camera I need to discuss my favorite and my least favorite first my favorite you can charge this camera just like its predecessor by just plugging in a micro USB cable like this little cable here which everybody has they sell in every drugstore in America you just plug it in and it starts charging if you have one of these batteries on the road its this is a feature that should be on every single point shoot Sony thank you for putting this here and my least favorite part of the Sony rx100 Mark 6 Sony I dont know what you were thinking theres no microphone theres no audio input on this camera so in addition to not having a place to to mount it this is what the top looks like theres no place to mount the microphone also know where to plug it in not people that have external audio on this camera will always limit its capabilities so that concludes my review of the Sony rx100 Mark 6 I hope it was helpful to answer the question that I started this out with is this camera worth 1200 to or 500 bucks less theres no question but for now its gonna be a difficult sell incredible device really tricky price

looking for an applicant to be in charge of three six eight gaming head of gaming at three six eight a major role and well I wanted to be a little update so in total weve had about 8 000 applicants and weve been through all eight thousand applications five thousand three hundred and sixty six were trashed as in people just wasting our time not serious applicants 1213 were spam another 1180 were wildly unqualified only ninety three were located in the New York City area three hundred and thirty or international applicants and heres one that really gets me of the viable applicants and people who could be potentially considered for this role 931 were male and only sixty were female so about six percent of the applicants were eligible women which is a bit of a bummer regardless were working through them now to date weve only physically interviewed one person but I think thats pretty good so Ill keep you updated as that progresses it is a process though all right no I just gave a 3 6 8

it's hard to make the good things last,2018-06-15T20:47:43Z,6.25,1368889,77547,so being a youtuber its the greatest job ever and because of this job and what I do Ive gotten to do some of the most incredible things that I could have ever imagined when I was a kid and I think the greatest thing about being a youtuber about being creator having a big audience has been the people that Ive gotten to meet and when I think of all the people that I get to meet like what is the most whats the most special in there at the very apex of that pyramid at the very very top has been the individuals Ive gotten to meet through the make a wish Foundation and make a wish is an organization that takes very sick young people and kids and grants them a wish maybe they want to get a Disneyworld or surf in Hawaii or go to a movie set and theres been a couple of kids whose dream its been is was to meet me and one of those young people was a young man by the name of Errol and maybe you saw the episode Ill link it below but arrow came here to the studio and we hung out and we got to know each other and hes like a fantastic musician and we went to the park and he played the piano and we had lunch with Candice and we drove around on a limousine and like greatest day ever and at the end of like this awesome day I said there was like arrow like why me like why do want to pick me I know you dont want to be a youtuber why me and he was like Casey Ive seen how you can bring attention to causes you believe in and I wanted to talk to you about bringing attention to a cause that I believed in and at the end of that it was like the reason why this kid used his one wish to spend time with me is because he thought working with me would be an amazing Avenue to bring attention to others who are in need like a total act of selflessness but all he wanted to do was to help others I got just like blew my mind you know when I was his age I was like smoking pot and chasing girls and heres this young man whos sick trying to trying to spend his life to help others so so that was a that was that was many months ago that he and I connected and loosely kept in touch and kept track of Eros since we spent that wonderful day together and a family friend of his reached out to me on about a week ago letting me know Eero wasnt doing well and then they got in touch with me yesterday let me know that Errol had passed away if you watch the video below he doesnt seem sick which is its even harder for me to really understand because um in any event hes no longer with us and you know anytime I experience a loss of life or someone I cared about our new goes away it just makes me really stop and think of what matters the most like what is most important and I love things like I get excited about all my stupid boosted boards and I get excited about like camera gear and I get excited about flying cars and and I get excited about work and I mean Im a very I I can get obsessive about almost anything but but really what matters and the only thing that matters is my relationship are your relationships with other people something that Ive I say a lot something I really believe in is that a life not shared is a life not lived if you dont share your life and share your happiness with other people and let other people into your life then are you really living then whats the point so Im just taking pause today to stop and think about all the people in my life that I love and I appreciate and maybe you want to stop and just take a moment to think about the people in your lives that you appreciate because its easy to get caught up in the and the  and forget about what really matters I also just wanted to say I Romeros family friend they said that it was like his right up until the end he was mostly concerned with how he could help others so all linked cancer gogo which is arils nonprofit which his parents are maintaining to help kids and help people who were affected like he was Ill link that in the description below if you dont even give him a dollar theyre trying to have everybody give him a dollar okay now I want to sing you a song yes sing all of you a song Im not gonna really sing its I cant sing but I want to share with you the lyrics of one of my favorite songs which for me puts things in perspective okay this song is called do you realize by the Flaming Lips and its its an incredible song but it goes this is part of it but it goes do you realize that everyone you know will someday die and instead of saying all of your good byes let them know you realize that life goes fast its hard to make the good things last you realize that the Sun doesnt go down its just an illusion caused by the world spinning round okay Music life goes fast Hogman the good things I realize undone just in caused by the Music spinning,155.36,relationships,0.0,1.0,MTBMJ40MM8E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTBMJ40MM8E
dear haters,2018-06-13T16:21:28Z,10.383333333333333,1468977,54589,Music your office know its a lot Music Ill be doing I dont know just a lot okay should we go in okay for those of you just joining us dan and I are in the former dollar pizza were on our way to get coffee and the door was just like left slightly open dan back in the day the best dollar Keiths in the city was there seriously theres no one in here a new restaurant oh dude its so gross its like sticky dough this is Dan and Casey reporting live from the unlocked closed down former dollar pizza so we got in a restaurant review restaurant you two thumbs to the proprietors of roll to go dollar pizza you left record or a lock Music damn can I see the new movie at the end of today my server at the end the day cuz you dont want to show it to me because its not done mmm a little bit of this okay  yeah okay I just want to say before I see it that I thought your intro to yesterdays tech Tuesday was filmmaking perfection linked below if you havent seen it so I was reading some YouTube comments and I read poeple that really hurt my feelings and I wanted to address them the gist of these negative comments were like what happened to three six eight I knew it was bullsh this is just a regular vlog why dont you talk about three six eight anymore three six eight is a fraud you dont know anything about business look it hurts my feelings because its wrong and I took all this time in a previous episode to explain as clearly as I could to these haters that less sharing intention more sharing action I said this yet these people these haters these mega Megatrons are bringing me down and it made me think of one of my favorite fake Chinese proverbs which is people who say it cant be done should not interrupt those who are doing it Im doing it stop interrupting me with your negative YouTube comments that are hurting my feelings so this update is for those haters those doubters let me show you a little bit of what 3 6 8 has been up Music you see once the Death Star is fully up once three six eight is fully operational then almost every episode the narrative of every episode will be about three six eight doesnt mean what Im making progress a lot of progress remember how it used to be one gigantic huge open space well now we put it in a wall to see this wall this makes this fun fun space break its own little space and what were gonna do with this like separate room were gonna make this room a retail space like a space thats open to the public its not open to the public yet but it will be open to the public construction team this space will be open to the public this would be a retail store this will be an art installation space for the first first exhibition were gonna do were putting a tattoo artist in here and in the window you can come and watch him do tattoos closes it opens up the front space to the back space its not something that we need or are interested also maybe hard to tell on camera but its all a beautiful shade of white back here because we painted the entire space you might notice its a little bit darker in here than it used to be thats because we tore out all of the track lighting so you could be tracked lights that run the entire length of this space we tore them all out were gonna redo all the lighting thats happening thats happening now thats what this is all about and you see the investments in new hardware here weve got 265 inch cubes and then right here we have the granddaddy the biggest Hewett on the market eighty eight incher were not a hundred percent sure where these monitors are gonna be used but I think the eighty eight incher is gonna be for our new gaming setup this is this is excited the three six eight kitchen the kitchen this is where we can have our dinners this is where we cannot creators who do like cooking channels and stuff like that coming prepare a meal for people its being built out right now this is the countertop bar area theyll be a sink here theres gonna be a stove here a refrigerator here and then look look at this right here we already put in water we had to put water in here we had a pipe plumbing pipe with the this is water we had to put this in you know complicated that is and probably most importantly the three six eight team is being built out cant introduce them yet because theres an HR process that we have to work through but youll know Im soon enough sorry guys its okay you see three six eight the idea the business its all predicated on first having the perfect space and lower Manhattan for creators until we have that we cant really kick things off and thats what weve been focused on its been just under two months weve made significant progress and well were almost there that over there thats Queens that over there thats thats Manhattan Im headed to Queens its a lovely place I dont know if Ive actually ever been there in the blog before lovely place and now Im in Queens not entirely sure where to where to go right on Jackson Avenue left on 21st Street see as much as I love this city I seldom leave like a 10 to 15 block radius around worthy offices so this is a part of the world called Long Island City its called Long Island City but its its actually Queens its still very much so New York City but short of running the New York City Marathon which comes through here I dont think Ive ever been to Long Island City before its awesome out here alright Im back in Manhattan let me explain what happened I was all the way out in Long Island City because my dear friend Gary Vaynerchuk whos also one my favorite people on planet Earth asked me to do something with his his company out there and of course like any excuse to work with Gary his team was amazing and they gave me directions but then I was like I was like Dorothy seeing the Emerald City for the first time Long Island City was awesome and I was like checking the place out and I was wandering around and then before I know it I got super lost and then I was trying to call his people and then my phone died and what Google Maps it would be a 20 minute trip ended up being an hour and 45 minutes and well now I gotta be home to relieve the babysitter in ten so Gary Im sorry Garys team a friendly sorry for just totally screwing the pooch on this one I hope hope youre not mad at me Music all right we are out here outside of Shake Shack its like 10 of midnight Dan when you said later today I didnt know this is what you meant buddy I got I got a baby at home I know Grove and I just had to get it perfect I ate it until its perfect at 8 oclock exactly dont and it goes up okay all right this is it Im putting in Dans headphones and Im watching Dans movie called we are not friends for the very first time

my FaVoriTE CELL PhonEs! (tech tuesday intro by Dan Mace),2018-06-12T15:23:28Z,11.433333333333334,1757923,51669,you think youd be happy there sure I think Id be happier there than I would be in LA Im a hundred percent certain

died after being left on 24 hours a day seven days a week for seven straight years Marlin Candice was upset because youre the one of the first people I told about her being pregnant you really think

a half months without her company and it feels like Ive been half a human I know are you gonna do like a rose petals on the bed kind of thing like a romantic when you see here with this video go die before she gets here because Music okay so for todays tech review Tuesday I got you juice thank you I got you juice all right lets see its called love at first sight but look its really its like the healthiest healthy one they make yeah and this one is tasty too what is this it says your name on it Marlon no no I said you see this draw I love you yeah it looks nice right it looks exactly like you yeah okay I think that was for false starts now I can start tech review Tuesday dan roll the intro today in tech review Tuesday were gonna talk to cell phones now Im gonna be reviewing the one plus six which I just got not even opened yet before I do my general thoughts on cell phones as of June 2018 goes like this my favorite mobile phone operating system is pure Android running on the pixel 2 but I still carry an iPhone because an iPhone has iMessage and FaceTime which are the best messaging and video television on the market also the iPhone goes to the Apple watch which integrates pretty well with the running apps that I use my favorite cell phone camera is the samsung galaxy s 9 its the best low its just the best cell phone camera on the market right now but its still not my favorite phone my favorite phone is still the Samsung Note 8 and its the best because because it has a stylus and S Pen and it operates more like a computer than a phone and that makes it my favorite now a look at the 1 plus 6 Music right off the bat its got one Hardware feature that I think should be required on every phone made and that has a physical switch that takes it from ringer to vibrate were reaching a point with cell phones where at least from the front they all looked the same just kind of slide the glass curve the glass back on the oneplus does feel pretty sexy its got a notch in the top right there like an iPhone one thing it does have that super interesting is that when you use the provided charger this thing goes from zero to a full days charge in 30 minutes at least thats what they say just a quick thought for all cell phone manufacturers on planet Earth we as consumers will always prefer a slightly longer battery life to a phone thats like a millimeter thinner okay lets compare the size differences here are fairly negligible this is the one plus now as I was setting up the phone to go to a quick photo test I set up the facial recognition the facial scanner the face to unlock like the iPhone 10s it seems pretty great seems to work about as well as the iPhone 10 one thing it does have that the iPhone 10 does not have though is a fingerprint scanner and addition to the facial scanning so I like the idea of having that the redundancy in case Ive got glasses or a motorcycle helmet or something blocking my face theres still the fingerprint scanner there now this is by no means a super comprehensive camera quality test but theres some amazing light out this afternoon so Im just gonna take the same picture across these four phones thats the pixel to excel the iPhone 10 the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and then the one plus 6 and I cant stress how lovely the light is right now so Im sure all these pictures gonna look great okay Music this is more of a challenging lighting condition this is to test out the dynamic range minigolf Music all right now Im gonna do an indoor test I just need a Ill go get another juice so the lighting in here is like your typical indoor lighting so lets lets just the hard one all right so this would be the last photo test I do this is just your basic selfie photo nothing special about this Im just gonna turn it on selfie smile and take a picture all right and that concludes the photo test portion of this review I gotta say out of this go back to the studio so overall the cameras not bad I think that compared to the pixel 2 or the iPhone 10 or the Samsung S 9 its not quite as good these are the top cell phone cameras on the market right now and I think the the 1 plus 6 is is good its definitely good enough its definitely better than most cameras of last years generation but it doesnt it doesnt take the prize for the best camera on the market so in conclusion in conclusion is that this is not a fully comprehensive review this was more of an unboxing because I just got this thing Im going to take my sim card out of this and put it into this to test it out for the next week or so and Ill do a little update not as a tech review Tuesday but just as like a part of a different episode to let you know what I really think of this cell phones remain my single favorite piece of technology if youre interested in working in media youtuber filmmaker photographer you can literally build an entire career using nothing but your cellphones alright Ill see you tomorrow on 3 6 8

Kennedy Airport and Im currently on their way to Las Vegas this is not like a bachelor party trip or like a party trip or a gambling trip this is more about science so yes science Ill explain when I get there I got a I got a go to bed now ladies and gentlemen get low intellect with me Las Vegas local time is 5 10 22 and Music they have slot machines in the airport here Im in that hotel room now and I and I am going to explain to you exactly what Im doing here in Las Vegas but first I need to show you this hotel room Justin the last thing Ive talked to you about yesterday was that I would be happy to sleep on the couch if you wanted to just get one small room for us to share yeah what is this absurdity Elaine wouldnt havent allow me to show you this hotel remain a brief tour of the hotel room this is the coffee maker breakfast table living room number one living room number two guess this is like a bar place a kitchen but we made it our office foosball room bathroom number one stairwell hallway master bedroom awesome bathroom number two bathroom number three bathtub number one bedroom number two this is a steam shower number two I think that concludes the tour of the justin hotel room todays place justin Larry Tate is a single seat flying machine its a 250 pound vehicle called flyer think pontoon plane mixed with drone you fly it over the water the company behind it called Kitty Hawk is funded by the Google co founder run by self driving car pioneer Sebastian turn oh my god yep so thats what were doing here Larry Page the co founder of Google has this side project thats like to build a fly its not a drone no its like a tiny flying car ultralight aircraft I think thats how they got approval to actually fly it okay but no one has flown it they just announced that this thing exists this morning they invited me out here and because Justin built the human flying drone Im like this is the best aeronautics expert I know he has to be there today were going for training yeah theyre gonna show us how it works were not here right I dont think so I think thats the first thing tomorrow morning today were gonna train and then tomorrow morning at 3 am were gonna fly it and thats were doing here science Music you sure you know how to handle this thing me not know you can worst driver on planet Earth Music Music within like a couple of hours you are going to be 100 capable of flying this vehicle this feels like a total like mission impossible area 51 approach and were in this Lagoon outside of Las Vegas well done a little ways here little oasis yeah just we need to reveal yeah thats the big reveal okay ready its like a PlayStation controller can I say that its like a PlayStation controller Music the goal is to make flying absolutely easy something that you can learn to do in a couple hours Music this is the simulator right Im gonna now go in the simulator and learn how to virtually fly the flier is that that factor okay Im now getting in the simulator right here all right Im ready fathers start to ramp down will start to slow down and then you can purchase it out so those are the basic functions for flying you and it I was really paying attention yeah yes it felt extremely intuitive this might be a reach but it seems easier to fly them like a Mavic drone theres less axes Im also trying their controller I can yeah you dont yeah and like you dont have to think about once youve set your altitude you dont have to I mean the consequences theyre just slightly higher than flying a 600 are drones but it felt as intuitive jacked this is the part where I sit in that flyer right there were not going up at all right its anchored but its gonna spin Music alright this is it this is the last bit of emergency training what what exactly is going on here this looks like Chuckie Cheese so this is the last part of emergency procedures training this is our dry lake it is full of colorful balls were gonna put you in and were going to spit it upside down and have you release the seatbelt and get out done all right again just wait so were done flipping then release and swim out of the driveway all right well go that way it will count to three one two three down and knowing what it feels like okay thats it for me Music Applause Music all right thats it thats all the training tomorrow morning Ill be flying you tune in tomorrow

DJi Ronin-S  a first look at this dope gimbal,2018-06-05T21:32:29Z,10.666666666666666,2063115,50921,okay I think I got it its taken me like 25 minutes to figure out that effect in fact Ive had a Pete Evan Lestat weve all been trying to figure that ox its like this mean that I saw on Twitter God look how good hers is ready its funny every single time differences thats real do you think thats real magic do you think that mine is as funny of that no you can be honest look good no comment the whole scene is okay welcome to 360 Music okay so I dont know if you know Evans channel or not you should if you dont Ill link it below but great very smart channel and we were just having a conversation about editing like editing videos with yall what the hell are we saying just how editing is really yeah we were talking about outsourcing like I had my managers are constantly asking me to outsource parts of my show so that I can free up time to be more productive with other things and I just cant possibly see how that would work and Ive tried like people always say when I    about how busy I am everyones always like get an editor yeah get an editor I tried or people are like cool that Dan edits to your videos Dan thats what I thought I thought he edited a incredibly talented but he doesnt come anywhere near these edits sometimes he color corrects me doesnt do the edits and of the 800 videos I have in my channel Ive yet to find somebody who can edit my voice yeah literally the milliseconds between two lines in a voiceover I am spending probably 15 minutes moving that audio file like zooming in all the way and moving it just a tiny little bit playing it over and saying is that pause enough to get to jump it into the next thing is the momentum the right way like I cant imagine anyone anyone because thats your brain yeah its very frustrating when you see comments and notes where people are so dismissive of editing as if its like putting gasoline in your car like its an objective process or a mechanical process the art is in the Edit and the fun is in the Edit   I dont agree with that well I mean I know like I enter like a flow State in editing its when you finish the Edit theres nothing more satisfying yeah and theres nothing more disturbing than realizing you havent eaten for 13 hours okay Evan in Casey discuss editing Music hello and welcome to tech review Tuesday tech review Tuesday were and I review a piece of technology that Im interested in or curious about and share my findings with you on this weeks episode Im going to be reviewing the new DJI Ronin s video stabilizer but before I do that I wanted to share with you some technology that I think is really really cool Im not going to review I just want to just want to show you this this is made by a small company out of Detroit called shinola and whats cool about this company shinola the company was started when all of the auto workers in Detroit were losing their jobs and this company was started to put all those like skilled workers to work making other things in addition to making watches and handbags and all that stuff they made they did a super super limited edition run they made 500 of these things this is a proper turntable like a record player shinola as we were sort of building out what the audio system should be down at 368 I was like I was like lets use this handmade american made Detroit made and turntable I dont know record players but this is just the bit that sits on it this probably weighs like 20 pounds this is like a piece of jewelry Wow Music Laughter Music now Im no audiophile Im not like one of those music guys but the audio difference from like something like this like an actual record with high quality speakers versus like I usually do like ear pods and Spotify myself the sound quality is unbelievably different okay so now for the tech review part of tech review Tuesday this is the Ronin s the roving 2s is a a gimbal for SLR cameras made by DJI the same company that makes all the drones that I and everybody else the world uses designed is the all in one workhorse for almost any type of filmic Ronin s is packed with incredible features that offer the ultimate flexibility for single or multiple operators on any set Music a 3 axis gimbal is basically a mechanism to make sure a camera stays steady as its recording as its moving this is a three axis gimbal by GoPro and see in theory anyways no matter how much I move this handle the camera stays in sort of the same position this right here this is a gimbal on the bottom of a drone same idea you put the camera here no matter how you move your hand it stays in one position what was typically used for stabilizers for bigger cameras or something like this this is a really fantastic device made by movi you put the you put a camera down here and then no matter how you move this thing it stays stable amazing device this is how I shot the snowboarding in New York City movie and the Aladdin video was with this bad boy but its a little bit big a little unruly you have to actually have a stand just to put the thing down from where I gathered the Ronin s is kind of the answer to all of that its a small handheld stabilizer that does what the big one that does what the big one does but is the size of one of the smaller more miniaturized gimbals it totally Crittenden lets do this so was lovin right so this thing does a lot more features than what were playing with it for today theres an app that works with it that you can program you to really complicated time lapse features the Ronin s app complements the gimbal giving filmmakers even greater control over their creativity wherever your passion takes you Ive only used it for about fifteen minutes it feels super simple hows your arm I mean its heavy it is heavy it takes one hand you can definitely operate it with one hand there is something I liked about it which is the you can have a microphone on this like I do here and still have it work on the gimbal and still be as stable as can be which is pretty amazing oh the selfie mode is really good too like your gorilla pod I mean you have a really good grip on it so you have stable shots but all you have to do is hold that thing youll get really stable yeah if youre like a sociopath when it comes to making vlogs you could shoot this all of your vlogs on something like this like look this is me using this as if its a selfie stick slip on you have to have strong forearms this thing about double the weight doubles the weight of the camera but it is amazing that this replaces such a gigantic piece of hardware alright so we do some shots through the trees now yeah lets some cinema Music oh okay that concludes the first look of the Ronin s3 accent three axis stabilizer huge fat thumbs up take it for what its worth though because weve only had three hours with this issue just starting to play with it so far very impressed I do want to flag that I I have a plan to shoot an entire episode of three six eight using just this gimbal to give it right to give like a really comprehensive review of all the details and all the features that this thing does thatll come soon for now though good work DJI and would you look at this look at this beauty right now Music Music you

FLexing so hard in our $299 Private Jet.,2018-06-01T00:35:37Z,8.516666666666667,1561922,48987,Music thank you thank you very much all right back at the airport again okay very very exciting episode of 368 coming at you today today Im going to be doing a collaboration with one of my favorite YouTubers a guy named Marquez Brownlee were shooting that collab in a different city than New York so we have to fly there and to fly there were going to be taking a private jet title is not click bait this private jet costs us exactly 299 dollars to fly us from New York City to Florida Ill explain okay so 299 dollars how did this happen for 299 dollars its a little complicated but but when they need to move a plane like this plane was here in New York City and they needed to move it to Florida they were just gonna fly an empty plane its called an empty leg and if youre in the right place and the right time you can actually get one of those empty legs so they were moving this plane and we are like cargo and that 299 dollars is just to cover the cleaning fee for the plane and it just so happened that we need to go to Florida to shoot a movie on the same day that they need to move a plane to Florida so we get it for 299 bucks right Marquez kind of worked out that way didnt it it did its pretty good have you ever been on a private plane before Ive never once in my life even been on a private jet and now were uh were gonna fly on a scale of one to excited how are you feeling this is like a 17 18 right now Music all right now uh now were in Florida are those our cars I believe so did you organize that kinda yeah Im going in the Maybach Im down here as kind of marquezs what second unit camera man were a team today were a team today yeah Marquez is here making a video for his series called autofocus kind of a plan where its Auto being a car focus of the video being on the car and hes here today to make a video about a car and I told him that I would come and handle all the aerial cinematography because that is my forte is that pretty accurate thats pretty good so were gonna have a bunch of shots its its just gonna be a fun video its gonna be a fun its gonna be fun good old fashioned good old fashioned fun video today yeah so the reason why we had to come all the way to Florida to get the car that Marquez is making a video about is because he needed a Lamborghini of course and I guess this is where like the best Lamborghini dealership is look at this place Music now I dont trust myself enough to drive in a Lamborghini so I went ahead and rented this here minivan its a fine minivan yeah now Marquez is going to get into that lime green Lambo right there and were going to go to the location were going to shoot is he is he gonna drive thats not up to me yet the real question is will he be able to keep up with my minivan no chance Music time hey director whats happening were uh positioning the car and were gonna start getting some b roll start shooting this thing Music all right have fun with your Lamborghini Im gonna go ride the skateboard Music not that behind the scenes is an interesting but theyre just getting b roll Im gonna go check out Palm Beach look at this house now I dont know a lot about Palm Beach but I do know that all of these houses have just fantastic Hedges look at this looks like Minecraft Music camera fell over when are you gonna when are you gonna drive this thing Marquez hopefully soon I think were were trying to get as many shots now still before we even anger these people and rub the engine a lot and then leave this car looks tiny next to you Marquez you look twice the size of this car I think wait though probably yeah yeah this is just this is just to get audio were in a neighborhood right now am I the only one who feels bad for The Neighbors Music doing some uh some rolling shots here so let me get this straight youre sitting sideways and your legs are Tangled this is the safety yeah you guys are doing great thanks everybodys doing great Music thank you I feel like its also theres a small crack there Marquez what exactly happened look okay were going over uh were going over a golf course Fairways no one golfing were just going down the middle of the Fairway and we just send the Drone down the middle of the Fairway you know how those trees on one side trees on the other side they just kind of wrap around behind so were sending it down the middle of the Fairway and Im like yeah were good were good coming up on one of these trees back here but dont worry about that just stay down the middle of the Fairway and then suddenly it hits that tree so clearly my depth perception was a little uh a little bit yeah its just just a depth perception issue so uh yeah yeah Ill take Ill take part responsibility yeah no its not partial is generous yeah yeah you know what this ones on me all right this ones Music foreign Music those guys are actually staying till tomorrow to do more production but I need to get back I got to see the family ladies and gentlemen welcome to North Liberty International Airport local time is 11 36 we will be texting the next few minutes please

Do You WANT TO WORK at 368?,2018-05-29T21:38:06Z,7.6,1508910,51914,Applause Music today is a holiday called Memorial Day its a day where here in the States we remember lost servicemen and women who fought for this country its also a day when kids dont have any school so we took Francine to the this Science Center here that thats were up to now Music goodbye Liberty Science Center well see you next time very good family adventure today Music oh hey would you look at that Caseys reviewing another skateboard yes and no you see this is no ordinary skateboard thats right it folds a folding longboard and I gotta say Ive had this thing for like weeks and I was really reluctant to review it because another skateboard really but Ive been very very impressed by its performance see Im a big believer in traveling with the skateboard that is with my suitcase and my luggage and everything else I always have a skateboard with me in the last couple of years thats usually met one of these a penny board penny boards are plastic theyre unoffensive and like TSA and Airlines usually dont give you a hard time about it before this I had a small skateboard like this that was wooden but this looks like a skateboard I got a bunch of these taken away so this plastic thing was kind of my only option and I like the penny board but Im a grown ass man and this little plastic skateboard is not much bigger than my foot so theyre fine but theyre theyre not like theyre not skateboards in fact I was riding one of these in Amsterdam I fell off it and broke my pinkie that was like a year ago my hands still not the same so definitely good enough to travel with but not perfect by any means enter this thing called board up is a terrible name its footprint is actually smaller than a penny board it rides like a normal longboard its fast its smooth you can carve on it quiet moreover the last couple of weeks Ive had this thing with me on a flight the UK Ive had it with me in Germany I had it with me flying out of France and the French can be real hard asses about travelling with skateboards Ive had this thing a number of airports on a number of airplanes nobody says a thing probably because it sort of fold up like a little briefcase the mechanics of how it works is very interesting   this is the hinge here this aluminum plate is to displace the stress that the hinge puts on the wood this cable here goes this toy right here which is meant to be kicked it activates the cable here releasing it like so very impressive stuff Samarra do you have the folding skateboard is that I give it a big fat thumbs up okay and that that concludes tech Tuesday this weeks tech Tuesday Music so yeah were hiring three six eight is at a kind of critical juncture right now and its growth the physical space is now built out enough for us to start thinking about building out different aspects of the company in one aspect of the company that Im super anxious to get moving on is gaming so this position this position would be kind of the head of three six eight gaming someone to lead the gaming initiative at three six eight and that means everything from helping us build our own team to hosting tournaments a strategy to everything in between putting the physical build out of what we want to build in there which is like a tournament space and a gaming space and figuring out a streaming strategy and theres a lot to it that this is also the first position at three six eight that Im like crowdsourcing to find the right person because I genuinely believe that this role could be filled by someone of any gender of any background from anywhere on planet earth in any age this we filled by anyone I just need a pro I need someone who understands this stuff way better than I could ever understand it I need someone who sees things that I dont see Music now if you think youre the right person for this job email me at three six eight gaming at KC nice calm give me like a cover letter just try to explain why you think youre right for this gig thats what I want to hear a couple of things a couple of things you should know anyone who physically shows up here at the space to apply for this job is immediately disqualified even if youre just dropping off a resume you thought youd knock and hand it off disqualified do not show up here someone who doesnt understand that work shouldnt be interrupted on a whim is not someone who really should be working with us also if you are local thats better or if you have somewhere to stay in New York City also better so you got to figure that out on your own it is a paid job and the more successful we are the more well pay okay okay whether youre interested in this role or not Im gonna keep you the audience up to speed with this whole process as it progresses okay three six eight gaming I hope to hit get off soon and I just need a little help figuring it out Ill see you tomorrow in three six eight

catching up here in the office Music open up and open a couple of these while I am well I answer a couple of questions off of off of Twitter theres been a lot bubbling up okay before I get started speaking of Twitter so I saw this video Applause Applause I gotta say good on the guy who saved the little kid excellent climbing skills way to act fast way to be brave to save a child the question I was left with is what the was the parent thinking like what are you what in what circumstances is your four year old child in a position to climb over the fence and dangle by his tiny little baby arms three stories up additionally look at the proximity of the the father Im assuming thats the father all the news stories alluded to that being upon look at the proximity of the father to the child and thats like an 18 inch cap man you climb over the fence you jump you do what it takes to save your kid hes just sitting there waiting for this guy to climb sometimes I just see one of these like stories flipping through Twitter that just why in the world does that say do not bring inside your case your names Luis and Ive discovered your YouTube channel QE so Im included in this package is a small reward for all the work youve done this is this is great four pounds of mmm six pounds of gummy bears three and a half pounds of skittle he just about as a thank you for me making videos Louis MVP right here fan mail MVP thank you miss cherry Wallis asks I remember you mentioning videos ago the couples therapy wont will these become available when Candace and I have been sitting down and recording our podcasts which Ill link below if you dont listen to them you should listen them while weve been recording them weve also been been videoing us sitting there talking to one another Im gonna start a new YouTube channel soon and that YouTube channel is gonna have the various podcasts on it sue but the primary place for the podcast is still the pod cat like just download it thanks for your question cherry keep working mard keep working hard keep working hard thank you I will keep working hard this is a moon painting done with spray paint Lorenzo very cool when Im   your knee issue with running I thought you were going under the knife no Steve no surgery there was no my knee was fine it healed I made a video about it only two below ever thought of doing a touring vlog vlogging in every state and meeting some of your followers the reason why I cant do something like that right now Ive got a you know Ive got a three year old and I dont want to pull her out of school and I also dont want to leave her behind so great idea but this tweet is just one word and that word is Tesla yes I did buy a Tesla well I didnt find Im like leasing it or whatever but I dont get it for another month or so I will tell you that all of the fights that Ive had with Candace in the last two weeks are because I got a Tesla hey Casey Im CY from Malaysia been following their blogs with us kitty marshmallow for friends thank you Thank You drone case from go scope no scope great guys some friends of mine at the Midwest they make great great products next question are we gonna see the nice stepbrothers reunited at 3 6 8 the nice stepbrothers for those of you who dont know the nice that brothers is the name that I used to make movies under when I made movies exclusively with my big brother van he and I stopped working the other after the HBO series no were not gonna be making movies here 3 6 8 mainly because van lives 3 000 miles away which is a bummer I do see him just not as much as Id like but no hes in hes on the west coast alright heres kind of a big question is it worth starting a YouTube channel now in 2018 my answer for that is yes but if you were to ask me can you make a living on YouTube now in 2018 I mean the answer is still yes its just a lot harder and its harder because there are so many more very good kind of high quality youtubers that are on this platform with the purpose of making a living and as the space gets more and more crowded it just becomes more difficult to stand out so if youre a real believer and its something you love doing youre passionate about that shouldnt discourage you okay I dont know what its going on today with the mail time but again another insanely awesome candy package here to Casey aka the candy of shinato felix thank you for the candy and thank you for the long note somebody sent me this magazine I havent read it but it looks fantastic and just kidding thats me I have read it okay alright let me find like a really smart question to end this with how did you go from being a dishwasher to a YouTube star I made a whole like 500 videos about this maybe watch to draw my life Ill link that below okay awesome what did you do a collab with PewDiePie yeah Felix call me lets do a collab I can do better I can do better what do you think of your friend Sam disconnecting from Twitter do you think youd be able to live without Twitter considering youre pretty addicted Emilio I talked to Sam about what was going on because he wasnt just having issues with Twitter Sam I hope its okay that Im sharing all this Sam was having trouble just the spotlight of social media can be extremely burdensome you know I look at people like Elle Mills who just put out a video about the pressures of being a youtuber Ive often discussed the pressures of being a youtuber and its a tricky its a tricky thing to talk about because because to find success on YouTube is to live the dream like this is the ultimate and if you achieve this kind of success on this platform which so many people try to do like how dare you complain about it so its difficult to talk about because I dont think unless youve been in this position I think its challenging to empathize with it but the reality of being kind of in the spotlight of being on social media is that you you have these big audiences that are watching your every move that have expectations that are always either psyched about or feeling letdown about whatever it is youre doing and you as a creator youre trying to youre trying to focus on creating content that that youre into stuff that motivates and inspires you and a confluence of all those pressures the external pressures from outside the internal pressures from inside I think can be challenging its challenging to deal with Im an old man Im 37 and Ive been in the spotlight in one way or another for a while Im very good at at just brushing it off my shoulder but you know Sam is new to the spotlight and he god bless him hes had tremendous success on YouTube hes a fantastic creator and kind of the negative sides of that are the more stressful aspects of that are just now starting to weigh on him and Twitter I love Twitter but Twitter is the platform where those pressures are the most tactile if someones pissed off at you they just say Im pissed off at you someone doesnt like you they say I dont like you and as superficial and is stupid as like Twitter bullying may seem it does it affects you it affects me and it affects Sam so Sams fine hes a kick ass person a kick ass creator and hes not going anywhere but what hes dealing with is not unique all right now Ive got to get out of here maybe Ill have a little bit of Russian camp hey man you want some Russian candy Russia its actually really nice but it is been any live stream my dad at this very second acknowledged man I talked about the conversation that we had last week about like the pressures of being on social media and stuff I just uploaded a video about that actually you okay I talked about in the vlog is that cool yeah okay all right thats it thats all I wanted to ask you okay are you good Im great all right what are you doing now Im gonna go shoot all right good luck thank you Godspeed dance save me a donut all right back home back in the family

A Shark Bit His Hand Off.,2018-05-19T22:53:22Z,11.283333333333333,3127181,95383,how many Poles he do for four six so you are screwed in lets not do this Candide that whole entire scene Music dan has been expressing a desire to get more fit and healthy so this morning he is gonna be joining me on my run not as easy as its been doing great dude its doing great yeah youre done yeah whoo yeah okay Ill see you good job Dan gotta start somewhere and you did what Music bam bam bam wha bam wha bam ha be a and f BAM AB imp is a bad mother and today on three six eight Im gonna introduce you to one of the worlds greatest BAM this is Paul whats up Paul tell us a little bit about yourself ah youre about to meet a man who barely survived a shark attack and is now an inspiration to all of us three years ago Paul de Gelder was with the Australian Navy part of an elite dive team on a dive to test new counterterrorism hardware and then he was suddenly attacked by a bull shark Im Australian I opened up for Snoop Dogg in 1998 which was pretty cool wait and what capacity did you open up for Snoop Dogg I was a rapper if I YouTube searched I find a video of you rapping you cant find a video but you can find the song on iTunes whats it called pop its smoking hydro literally took the albums ago please welcome Paul de Gelder Music it was the epitome of a shocky day it was early in the morning Sydney Harbour so murky water it was overcast I was on my back in a black wetsuit and black fins kicking my leg a bull shark came up from underneath me and grabbed me by the leg and the hand in the same bite decided it wanted them more than I did and started tearing me apart and took me underwater in total agony drowning me losing blood nearly dead ripped out my hamstring and took off my hand and so I had to swim back to my safety boat missing a hand and part of my leg through a pool of my own blood where my buddies were waiting to give me first day Music and they did that they kept me alive one of the guys had to stick his hand inside my leg and pinch closed one of the arteries and a week later I decided to have the leg removed because I couldnt feel it I couldnt move it it was gonna be useless for the rest of my life so I just thought stuff that Ill just get them to turn me into a terminator how did you swim with no arm and no leg slowly but I know we get trained to deal with very stressful situations how do they train you to deal with a situation that that was that was you know up a few tears from what I was used to but the medical training kicked in and I thought okay my hands missing Im bleeding Ive got to keep that wound above my heart so Im swimming like that with one arm out of the water kicking one leg because I couldnt even feel the other leg and just going really slow at the same time the guys in the play are coming over towards me I didnt even think I was gonna make it I thought the shark was gonna come back it was gonna grab you by the ankle take me down and kill me so it didnt matter all I had to do was just keep trying until that happened show us your how does this work so this is called the Michelangelo its a made in Germany its about 19 000 for this thing I think its the best robotic hand in the world but mostly just because I can change it from this grip to beer drinking grip if youre gonna have a 90 000 robot arm it might as well have a beer drinking group so the first time I met Paul was this past summer and you had on pants so I didnt see your leg yeah and hes just like a like Jack tattoo dude and I went and shook his hand ready okay but when you grab on theres like a proper squeeze there well thats still the go grip though whats fun but its not painful but if I dont know you or youve been a bit of a dick I may just squeeze down a little bit extra and wait for the flicker in your eyes I think you just right like you have me you could do it everyone the last time the the version before this I had chillie snapped in half armwrestling unfortunately you were armwrestling with a prosthetic hand like that with a girl there may have been some product oral damage there was some cracks in it because Im pretty hard on this Im about as hard on my prosthetics as you are on everything so I lost the hand and the leg if I was gonna lose just one it would not be a hand take the leg take the leg you can replace a leg so Ive got a running blade Ive got a swimming leg Ive got a diving leg Ive got this amazing 200 000 leg but you cannot replace a hand not yet theres no Luke Skywalker hand out yet and what allows you to get back in the water three months later what is it from inside of you that lets you do that its a deep love for being in the water for me I dont think you can get any closer to being an actual part of nature than being completely submerged in the ocean its relaxing it alleviates stresses and fears and you feel relaxed and it can wash away a lot of the stresses that are impacted on you throughout your life have you met Arnold Schwarzenegger yeah yeah I know him huge knowledge to you that youre closer to the Terminator than he ever is not quite Music Music water why one fall on a good life what do I want a bad love and a good life is gonna win every time I I was always that there was two things I was afraid of in life sharks and public speaking now I make shock documentaries to Shark Week and Im a public speaker so you never know what life has in store for you you just get like literally your biggest weaknesses can become your biggest strengths if you just face them head on all this amazing stuff came out of the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life Music Music look this is this is the new 368 mascot but this clickbait sooo good were going to save this for another episode how many pull ups he do for how many pull ups can you do Aaron fine really so Paul were gonna have Dan do a contest first Aaron and then you and I are gonna head your head is that sound good okay so what was the count lets not do this and eat that whole entire seed okay so thats this weather the shark took it off from but this is what we were discussing before why I have problems with the camera because I cant hold it with my right hand thats what you have to do yeah that can pass and then you like you when youre moving your arm youre    with the zoom and the you cant grip it theres no way to hold mine camera company its figure this out what do I do and this is what I use if anyone tries to mess with me as well one two man no not even slowing down eighteen nineties yes effects okay its good these three James describes one two ten eleven are you you nearly halfway Music good luck with the new goals of facing up against whoa Im gonna try Im never gonna reach 30 pull up level but Im going to try fire and good to see you bye guys okay thats one badass    indeed Music

We had to call the police at 368,2018-05-16T19:10:33Z,9.85,2177014,76164,I gotta start off todays gotta start off todays episode a little bit of a serious talk this morning at like 1030 11 I got a text from one of the guys that works for me and it said just FYI theres someone outside your door he wont leave I had to call 911 one somebody showed up here they were able to get into this building this is a locked and secure building but they probably snuck in behind someone else they came to outside my office door right here what you see behind this monitor and then they just refused to leave and Dan showed up and actually kind of interacted with the guy and film the guy on a phone Im gonna show you what it looked like but please know Im pixelating the guy and Im trying to alter his voice because I would assume hes doing this for attention and the last thing I want to do is give him attention but this is what it this would look like by breaking into someones night you know welcome yeah dude I dont care you cant do this you sent me an example of what not to do Im like nah you are no one has ever made it by breaking in a walking of nobodies in though this is a building with a closed door and a locking key and you snuck in the front door and you came up the stairs youre making yourself look really stupid in front of a bunch of professional people here that are trying to work look at me okay see youre not gonna come in if you if you look at me yet look at me you gotta go you gotta go the doors over there look at me I know youre trying to be case you talk to Casey you gotta wait downstairs like everyone else so I appreciate dan I appreciate Sam I appreciate Patrick for trying to get this guy out of here and do the right thing ultimately the police did have to come we did file a proper police report here the crime is criminal trespassing look I dont know if this guy wanted to hurt me if you wanted a selfie with me have no idea what he wanted but when hes confronted by three people who clearly know me he refused to leave showing up at my office as public as I make the address showing up here is just not appropriate one thing that happens often there makes no sense to me as a parent makes so no sense is when parents drive down here and sit here with their children to wait for me to come out of my office I love meeting people see me in the street make sure you say hi but in an environment like this is just wildly wildly inappropriate so this was a kind of a scary situation but just in general I just please be respectful of my office space in positive news though we are going to build like a retail were gonna build like a public space in some part of 360 a space that will be open and have some sort of normal hours so if you are in New York you can come visit and that is appropriate and its a space that I control it doesnt disturb my my neighbors this guys this guys not invited okay now I will start the vlog how to vote ideas youve had this was by far by far the worst idea Music youve got action and youve got intent without intent there can be no action but without action intent means nothing you see my biggest frustration with 368 the series this show is that I want to share with you all the intimacys of whats going on at 368 but company 368 the factory 368 this whole thing that Im trying to build here but its a slow process with 35 days in theres a lot happening theres a lot of theres a lot of action happening but I only like to share with you the action because to share the intent well I dont know about you but I find it frustrating when somebody says to me Im gonna do this or Im gonna do that instead I prefer to back off and then bring you back in when theres some action to show you so let me share a little action with you probably the biggest thing is whats happening behind me here see we cant open up this entire space to the public because well were trying to work in here but we want to build a space in the very front of the store want to build a space thats like you know we have hours and maybe its open one day a week or maybe its open two days a week then maybe its open more than that I dont know but a space that people who come in to want to have a merch store in here we want to have like an wont have a space where you can do like installations video installations art installations who know thats happening in real time this this this is an action not intent its not were gonna do that we are doing that not sure what the signs for but its just so cool we kind of had to have it this I guess is probably more like intent than action just this isnt really relevant to this this video its awesome theyre right Charlie sure what its for but we can easily take a picture of every visitor we have in the space just to sort of track things its a cool project this is our jump bike rack jump bikes are motorized bikes that you just sort of rent or borrow right around the city theres a lot more happening with jump bikes but I cant share it yet Im going to save the intent but I shared the action Music Music Music the office the office is not as all about intent this is where action takes place every single day the planning the plotting the future 3 6 8 it all happens right here the other thing thats happening thats very exciting is the team the three 618 is being built out we currently have five people that work for three six eight and soon youll be introduced to them right now its so kind of well theres like theres a lot of like HR stuff theres a lot of good reasons why you havent met them yet youll meet them soon five people its happening this is the location of what will be our second podcast were trying to avoid that diner motif here because ultimately it will be a talk show that we put most likely on YouTube or somewhere else but this is that its being built the first recording will most likely be this week so its happening action so thats it thats the update of three six eight a lot going on right now therell be a lot more to talk about very very soon but action the National Weather Service and not in New York has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Manhattan in southeast New York it look like that theyre supposed to huge storm today I didnt think was gonna happen oh my well we got to go to the highway its happening theres a huge storm really Music guy is madness all right so Ive made it out here this is where I want it to be the wind is actually not as strong out here as it was in the city where its so pretty strong you gotta see the sky Music I dont know where it is Im trying to take a picture this boat I feel like its fine oh its going haywire wait the shut oh Music its really coming cut it down oh its like a driving punishing ready the trainee stings and it hits you Oh thinking everyones everyones like running inside and youre like lets go outside coverage another boosted board Music    doing it Im having so much fun Music through this booth abuse was broken better plan we are poison the city pretty a look at that Music,142.74111675126903,inappropriate,0.0,1.0,m3TNhDwkL-Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3TNhDwkL-Y
CASEY NEISTAT IS THE WORST TECH-REVIEWER [GDU O2 Review],2018-05-15T17:46:27Z,8.316666666666666,1460138,44159,Applause Hey hey did you finish the tech Tuesday intro I need it for todays episode Music drones drones drones drones drones drones drones when you talk about drones you really talk about one brand and that one brand is DJI Music pji just dominates the market with hit drones like the spark and the Mavic air and me when consumers youtubers people like me think of buying a drone this is whats generally thought of and thats despite there being a number of interesting competitors that have come to the market like the GoPro drone which is an interesting device because it was dynamic you could take the camera out and mount it on your chest then there are other devices like like this sky do drone which is a start up their tracking technology is amazing but difficult to justify several thousand dollars when for several hundred dollars you can get one of these which which in a lot of ways is superior to the several thousand dollar one but just today I received a drone in the mail from a company I had never heard from the drone company Id never heard of and they pitched it to me as a DJI competitor this this is the GD uo2 drone lets unbox Music Im waiting for the battery to charge some initial thoughts on the GDU o2 now when you open the box youre greeted by these two things the controller and the drone it feels a little cheap but I know better than to judge a book by its cover you have 4k video obstacle avoidance 20 minutes of flight time just sort of whats expected from a small drone okay alright enough yapping go test this thing where theres a safe place to fly these things that stand behind me Sam is a tech aficionado and its here to consult on whether this GDU   is worth the damn or not yeah better is that better alright so Im not gonna do any big sweeping dramatic shots because I dont think youre supposed to out here better do a low flight and really focus on testing two things that is flight control how easy is it to fly in an image quality how pretty is the picture that it yields before I send this in the air one quick comparison with the Maverick air just uh both folding drones alright Im going to start with the Mavic air as sort of a controls who have something to compare the GDU o2 to Music Applause Music nicely done okay here we go this is the takeoff of the DD you see a man quality doesnt look bad based on what Im seeing on the phone the flight control though is very wishy washy it feels like what try to DJ I was several years ago on top of that theres major connection issues I can see the drone its about 60 feet from me yet Ive lost connectivity three times its a big deal when youre flying these drones Music I lost it I watched it crash like right over there there was no control what so it did you see it I watched you just did a dive bomb I mean it was you know Im only flying about 10 15 feet over the water here for safety and Im fly over the water to be saved and the thing just we see if we can get it Id see it make together he gets gone did you see it hes got a poor one out for that drone did you see it though father and son say they heard it and just hit the water and thats kind of it its in the water what are you laughing how much of you my review now Im no expert drone pilot Ive crashed more drones and Ive successfully flown but this was really basic flight and the thing just took off you saw I watched it just zipped and then just went just heal and then that was the end of that no sign of it before I sent the drone up in the air I said to camera image quality and flight controls are what Id be testing and the failure that was the GDU tests flight I think is solely to blame on the flight control itself flight control by the way is like this software its what how you interact with the drone as its fly when you pilot a drone youre like operating a vehicle that is up in the air and any sense of disconnection is like so nerve racking for me theres so many things that can go wrong and today was one of those days Im mostly just frustrated cuz I dont even know if I can call this a tech review I dont have the footage from the drift out of today guru welcome Dan good to see you and I dont even know if I can call us a tech review because I dont have the footage to compare against the other what happened I hate to give like a really strong negative review about something but why would you spend the same amount of money on something thats thats an inferior product all the way around went for the same dollar amount you could get something that is superior on all levels DJ Im DJ I doesnt pay me I just think they make great products I want to do a test with some so that you know that did you see yesterdays video where um look its literally called instant regret why would you do this its got six point four million on the scoville scale I dont want to do this right now   no you did you eat   I ate two of them you did eat   I may   if you you can eat Im going to write this do it do it come on choo choo choo choo choo choo dude hes tough hes touch he made it something is such a big deal watch it watch it go happily its like Im not gonna cry its like the hottest Kyle I cant even talk dude it hurts man youtubecom slash youtubecom slash Sam Shepard Ill see you there good luck

hE maDe ME ChaNgE The TItlE,2018-05-11T17:44:54Z,11.7,1228018,45501,by the way we havent formally launched the three six eight like program where we bring in young creators and they use the space and take advantage but somehow uninvited Jack coin different kind of episode today I think youre gonna like it Im pretty excited about it Music today Ill be telling the story of Dan mates sup Jaime whos shooting youre moving up yep so Dan as you know is my homie from South Africa hes here in New York for I dont know a couple weeks more and while hes been here hes been helping me make youtube videos but hes also here for his own thing and thats something we havent talked about yet on the vlog today seemed like a perfect day because Dan is gonna try to be hes not gonna try Dan is going to be making a video for his main channel today Im gonna be assisting him that felt like the perfect opportunity to I dont know kind of explain who Dan is and what Dan does a little bit better do I say something not whoa Dan what were you doing in South Africa before you moved to New York City I would direct TV commercials what was your favorite brand you made a commercial for um its not necessarily about the brand its probably more about the commercial itself which was a job I did for Tosca Naga in Kenya Im Dan Mays film director from Cape Town weve just wrapped up the TV commercial and short form for tasks did you like being a commercial director in the beginning when I came into it I really believe that that was what I wanted to do I thought that commercial film directing was my was the be all and end all for me I got to be on big sets have big crews work with lots of money but then eventually my ideas started but my ideas started to become watered down it started to become about a lot more than just the concept of filmmaking I just felt that the true essence of what filmmaking means to me was stripped away and I started to forget about why it is that I make phones so what does this movie today were making today today Im basically exploiting you and your channel to get me loads of fun Stan is downstairs waiting for me right now no joke I am truly genuinely nervous to be assisting him because like when were shooting its my video hes so good at backing me up and I am not good at assisting someone teaches Im like because Im always trying to impart my ways on their shoe hey pardon me guys dude do you want to see do you want to see how good of an assistant I am yes you forgot the memory card    okay first team Im gonna get you to do this three times Im gonna take a couple to either gonna walk pass to the time body therell be two of you yet its as simple as that and I I make films because I have not learned anything else and I know I can do it to a certain degree and it is my duty one of my favorite filmmakers Verner Herzog has 24 rules of filmmaking heres a couple of them and what they look like in real life number one always take the initiative hold the board over yet when you walk past that mark that middle monitor essentially you nine yeah you actually have a line youre shooting down here dad yeah were using the podcast yeah but I changed it check oh look at this this is the podcasting studio back here which by the way today Friday we launched the second I say this already we launched the second ever pod episode of couples therapy the podcast available were all podcasts are on Spotify on Apple podcasts on anchor go download it Candice and I really put a lot of work into this one you ready number two theres nothing wrong with spending a night in jail if it means getting the shot you need food you mean the contest can we not dip a little bit of this intelligence yeah yeah todays todays video is is about that its about my journey as a film director where Im not where Ive come from and how why Ive decided to make the step in my career that sounds boring you should make it sound more interesting for the people number five learn to live with your mistakes Ive lost Ive lost my script Im stressing out man it is so much easier to be directed by someone else than have to direct someone else Dan youre doing a great job   in total sincerity youre way nicer on set than I am yeah I didnt hear what I say that I go to the bathroom really number 11 ask for forgiveness not permission shooting in the sub basement Music the kinds of ads that I was doing I wasnt happy making right so what do you want to be when you grow up whats the big goal I want to be uh so my major goal is to be made my major goal is to be paid to make the films that I want to make I mean doesnt that sound like the dream number 17 dont be fearful of rejection were now headed out to the water to shoot what will be my final scene ready Music dan is on the

Is This Bike worth $2000? [SUPER 73 REVIEW],2018-05-09T13:35:06Z,10.533333333333333,4806177,96051,do you look cold on its ever do you look like a nerd I think you look like a badass dude Music Music a lot of people have been asking about my bike so lets talk about my bike Music todays tick review cheese never advised me to travel back in time Ive always sought means of transportation that are different from likes public transportations subways too noisy and crowded buses are too slow calves are too expensive drying is impractical walking this doesnt cover enough distance now if youve watched this vlog you know that my favorite means of transport are my boosted boards so I have so many of them a couple weeks ago I got one of these bikes its called the super 73 and its really really interesting a little history on the super 73 the parent companies called lithium cycles and they launched as a Kickstarter in 2016 they started shipping these bikes I want to say in early 2017 or late 2016 its a very cool company they work with a lot of youtubers and they sent me two bikes one for Candice and one for me kind of thought Id be like a joke that would sit in the corner of my office this things kind of taken over and its the first means of transport in New York City in whatever 2 or 3 years that has started to make inroads competing with my boosted board for my favorite way to get around and now a closer look at the bike Music right before Dan and I can actually shoot the out in the street version of this I have to have Sam teach me how to use the stabilizer and this all that totally said one secret stabilizer package for mr nice dad yeah it holds the ATD with like the super small lenses its really useful you think you can handle it I dont know Im scared of like riding and shooting but it holds the camera really well yeah sort of like a double tap are you Tuesday you mount it on the bottom here and then theres a bunch of different axes to balance locked and twisted ready to go so its neat is if you want to get the super low drop down shot you turn it over like this and then you can like really get super low to the ground and this is like ultra ultra stable shots yeah Music riding a regular boat gotta watch out for potholes yeah be careful of cars gotta be up guys gotta be mindful of the handlebars sitting in between other car most importantly you have to obey traffic laws Music so this thing at three what is this were just pedaling like a madman its not bad but its kind of a heavy bike to just pedal number two number two something called pedal assist and basically what that means is after you pedal the motor are you doing as you pedal the motor picks up and takes off for you its like you have super muscled superhuman superhero power and your legs like watch Im totally white already watch me take off later Music and in the lifeboat Music survive Music Music one advantage this thing has over other electric bikes and bikes in general is it can handle off roading like grass dirt gravel really well ready Music so theres a lot to like about this and and the reason why I think that this thing is kind of brought bikes back into my life in New York City is just cuz of how dynamic it is I put that milk crate on the back so now I can haul a bunch of things the range on its further than my skateboard its faster than a regular bicycle I dont get all sweaty I do feel a little bit safer on a bike that I do on a skateboard but there are concerns with riding an electric bike in a city like New York for example up until a month ago electric bikes were completely outlawed did you know that it wasnt like as in January they completely out as of October of last year mayor de Blasio mayor of New York City said no more power assist no more electric bikes so if cops saw you on a bike like that they immediately take the bike away and they give you an up to a 500 fine now as of April 8th of this year like five weeks yes about a month ago exactly actually to the day a month ago exactly today the mayor announced that that hes pulling that back and now bikes are okay if theyre power assist as in they pedal as well which this does so once again this bike is legal but these are kind of the concerns when youre on something that looks like that instead of a traditional bicycle but there is one factor that the super 73 has and maybe just as new but the fun factor I think is higher on this bike than maybe any other vehicle ever ridden in the city would would you agree its so much fun its so much fun Music one thing you consider though if you live in a city and you have a bike like this is if you leave it outside its going to get stolen so you gotta take it in Music and thats whats required to get this thing into my office uh its the last question ever so I guess the last it my overexposed its just so harsh Oh perfect perfect perfect dude the big question Arizona asked is how much of these things and they are right around two grand they have a couple of different versions to get but they start below two grand they go over two grand thats thats expensive its a lot of money for an electric bike but if you start to compare them to other high quality electric bikes its kind of in the sweet spot there are certainly bikes that are more expensive and theyre definitely having low quality bikes that are less expensive and thats kind of it on the super 73 one thing that I will say is this company seems youre doing a lot of work with YouTube creators I love that Sam here has done a video Sam here send it wide Sam here has done a video its super 73 she was subscribed to Sam by the way you helped me make this video Jesse who else is done Jesses worked with super 73 you work with so they just gave me this bike super 73 if you want to work with me more formally Id love to do something love your product but it seems like a great company its an American start up these things are designed in California and I gotta say for for if youre in the market for an electric bike is non traditional as this is because most of like they look like regular bikes this is like a your yeah this things pretty amazing and I have to say Summer 2018 this is probably gonna be my main ride right Im with it its so much better ride alright thats it for our 360 Ill see you tomorrow I rode my bicycle past your window last night I roller skated to your door at

NO EXCUSES.,2018-05-07T21:28:28Z,11.483333333333333,2277985,102807,when you compromise and you fail it really hurts it hurts even more and failing at what you love 20 years ago 20 years ago today is when Apple computers unveiled the first iMac this is iMac I saw that and I saw that on Twitter and I got super super nostalgia because it made me think it made me think of when I got this this is my iMac and this was the machine the first ever that I edited video on it got me thinking and got me nostalgic and it got me a little sad because I was thinking back to what my life was like then what my life was like at the exact moment when I realized my dream my ambition to one day become a filmmaker where I was then where I wanted to be and everything that stood in between me and achieving my dreams it got me thinking about those those obstructions the things you have to overcome to accomplish your aspirations in life so todays episode in its entirety is gonna be dedicated to one subject in one subject only and that is the subject of excuses excuses are exactly like holes everybodys got them but nobody wants to hear about yours Music this is you and here are your dreams and aspirations all that stuff what stands between you and your dreams and aspirations are obstructions what you have to overcome to achieve your dreams when I think back about my own obstructions when I got that IMAX I think of the fact that I had dropped out of high school I had no education to fall back on I think about the fact that I knew nothing about the very thing that I was aspiring to pursue my dream I knew nothing about filmmaking those were some of the gigantic obstructions between me and any realization of my ambition there were obstructions but they werent excuses would you welcome Jim Carrey Jim Music my name is Jim Carrey Id like to do some impressions for you tonight Jim Carrey one of the greatest American comedians ever in one of my absolute idols Jim Carrey Jim Carreys dad Jim Carreys dad wanted to be a comedian my father was not only the funniest man in the room and before I was born he had an orchestra in Toronto but you know in order to be something special you had to leave Canada and come down to the States improve yourself in the States he was a little bit afraid of that transition and and also he had a family to take care of so he he became an accountant and ironically ultimately he was fired from his safe job and him and his son Jim Carrey and the rest of their family they were homeless a lot of people dont know this but but when I was about 14 or 15 my father lost his job and I actually became homeless for quite some time Jim Carrey the movie star his obstructions were those things like being dirt poor his dad not having a job the fact that Jim Carrey had to drop out of school when he was 15 to work as a janitor the fact that Jim Carrey was homeless with his family living out of a car those were Jim Carreys obstructions but they werent his excuses excuses are the obstructions that become the reasons for you abandoning your dreams despite those obstructions he still overcame all of them to chase down his dream and become one of the most successful comedians in the history of comedy each obstruction that is not overcome becomes an excuse and these excuses ultimately take the place of your dreams and then all thats left are you and your excuses so today on the shot wanna introduce you to somebody who Im a huge fan of somebody who I draw tremendous amounts of inspiration from somebody who had greater obstructions than I could ever imagine obstructions that make you know being broke or not having education seem meaningless someone whos really chased down all of his dreams let me let me list some of his accolades hes a best selling author he had his own TV show that I think he wrote and directed hes friends with huge Hollywood movie stars like Russell Crowe and you know five big movie stars hes been on the red carpet of the Oscars the most famous red carpet in the world when he was a kid he wanted to be an action movie star and he had hit a major role and one of the greatest action movies ever made an action movie that won a movie that won six Academy Awards a movie that made three hundred and seventy eight million dollars in the box office he is by all means someone who had a bunch of drink had a bunch of dreams had a lot of obstructions and Ive never ever ever heard make an excuse there is its good to see you Quinn its been a while what time is it there all right I like to Europe early this may well be the most fragile boy in the world he was born with broken bones and they havent stopped breaking Quinn Im telling the story of of what it means to overcome obstructions in life to pursue a dream tell me your life story this young man is trying to do what the doctors deemed impossible which is brittle bone disease which means my bones break more easily than you or someone else you know and the doctors said that I wouldnt survive a day let alone however old I am now the one and only Quinton Kenna Han how did you get a part in Mad Max one of Australias favorite characters who is a filmmaker producer and disability advocate now has something else occupying his time Quinton Kenna Han has landed a role in a big budget Hollywood movie OC but just dont see whats magic tightly dead Music what what are some of the other accolades of your career that youre particularly proud of for the audience to learn about rights it that Im the only disabled person ever in an academy award winning I love that its not right yeah master goes to Mad Max fury road Federation from the Queen I like that awesome these are just Ingles these are just things yeah I agree the things that I love is that Im friends with you know Ive got good friends and a good support network in my family around me theyre the things that I hold the enemy your obstructions are a lot of them have to do with your physical state but you chose not to let your obstructions become excuses and use you that is true you still achieve your dreams despite all these obstructions and youre still a man with no excuses so I guess I would ask what advice would you have for well certainly for me because Ill take it but maybe for my audience about overcoming obstructions to in pursuit of your own dreams really when you get to a hospital yeah you really have to bring it down to two things youre either gonna move or youre either gonna dawn and I decided very early long on that can I swear youre sure Quentin youll bleep it out I decide if Im gonna live    it lets leave anytime gonna die    it bring it on dawg Music wins an amazing guy but theres one thing that he said that really it was when he said that he got the brass ring in life as in he got lucky and won at life that guy facing the hardships that he has to face dealing with the I mean just as the you know his own physical disability for someone to maintain that positive perspective on life I think that kind of positivity probably the most important thing when it comes to making sure your obstructions dont become your excuses okay thats it Ill see you

this $90 water bottle has a Hi Def Video Camera,2018-05-01T15:45:32Z,8.883333333333333,2496131,68271,cameras like that Music see what I see up there its almost almost sunny outside lets go this way I dont know hold on a second I gotta figure something out holding this in my hand its like a nightmare Music its really raining now were heading straight up the West Side Highway 34 3 Music Applause tech review Tuesday were beginning this episode at BH photo video arguably the greatest camera video store on planet Earth how we gonna knuckleball box what are the chances bikes are gonna be here loose them out this is done every good not too good no good fine ready okay thats good so our mission here is singular were gonna go inside B and H and were gonna find what it is were gonna review for this weeks technology Tuesday tech Music lets go lets go to the like weird surveillance like off brand off actually gonna do yeah this is the kind of weird but I was thinking look Judy I think we should get this coca cola camera that is cool coke bottle is out of stock were eating at a water bottle camera instead Music okay so on this in this box is in water bottle surveillance cameras capable of recording at 1080p high definition video with supposedly decent sound it comes in an unmarked box theres no label on this this whole thing costs 90 heres whats in the box weve got directions the bottle bottle cap camera module theres nothing special about the bottle it separate its a little bit heavier plastic than a regular water bottle I have this cutout here the camera kind of goes in yeah fits in like that put the memory card in you see the lens there a lens is that tiny dot aha look at it alright you see the hole right there that hole is meant to be lined up with with the lens of the camera module that goes into the bottle its gonna site and try to shoot something with this alright so the last step in the assembly of this water bottle camera is to actually put water in here the camera module is protected because on the outside of the plastic okay so its now filled up with water theres no way you would know that this is a camera it even has a little plastic bit here that makes it look like its never been open the weights the same that feels the same okay this is now a video camera this shot this shot is on an eight thousand dollar proper camera let me ask you a question you notice anything strange about this water bottle Music theres a video camera yes its a spy camera see we dont know if its actually recording anything should go back dump the card and co2 looks like now yeah Music Applause all right so Im looking at the water bottle spy camera footage for the first time its not terrible it has this kind of strange weirdo retro II grainy gritty raw look to it and while I cant be of any practical purpose for something like this it isnt interesting aesthetic and for 80 bucks it does kind of work Music so in conclusion I dont know I guess if you need a spy camera for 80 this thing is fine but everybody having a cell phone on their person and cell phones all having high def cameras built in why the hell would anybody need something like this except for really really really really really creepy gross reasons why would somebody need this Dan go spying on their like why something yeah creepy yeah so I guess my conclusion is that I feel like the world would be a better place if this thing didnt exist well see you next week on tech review Tuesday hey just real quick before you click away yesterday a friend of mine and a fantastic creator named Simone yutz she posted a video called Ive got a brain tumor and in it she shares the fact that she just learned she has a very serious brain tumor if you dont know Simone by the way you should check out her channel she is she makes robots and she has a robotics channel she also has the only as a woman she has the only robotics channel with over a million subscribers hosted by a woman shes shes done incredible work incredible creator because of this community have gotten to know her and shes an incredible person in the very heartfelt video where she talks about her her brain tumor its also funny its link below you should watch it she says how much support she draws from the YouTube community so I thought why not send this audience like why dont we go over to her channel and just let

DAN SCREWED ME OVER. (this is a clickbait title),2018-04-29T18:09:36Z,10.433333333333334,1310034,58829,Music hey check this out hello this is Roberto Roberto is in the olympics hes a runner I got an idea quick question for todays video Roberto and I have been talking about making a movie called Casey and Robertos guide to running for new runners or something like that if we were to make that is that something people are interested in Roberto is interested so Im off to a super super late start today cuz last night we were recording the podcast I just got behind so its like you know 200 in the afternoon right now which means I can go do my favorite thing surprise Francine as she gets out of school before she goes to dance class also could I show you my outfit today its like nice out today like really nice out so I got on a white jumper red shirt pink pants silver shoes Candice picked out most of these clothes but I just thought nothing makes me happier then how excited then seeing how excited she gets when she sees me surprise her at school the little things like you know damn I got a question yes my sir last night at the house where Adelaide mm hmm do you remember opening a bag of a pink bag of Hello Kitty marshmallows yes she was saving these so you did open them and before you open them they were completely unknowable right and did I do something bad those were Francines special marshmallows for her special trip and you opened them down and you open them Music this camera here it doesnt have doesnt have like a flip out so I have to plug in an external monitor but there was a minor mishap last week I ganked the camera and Im still connected to this thing and this thing just well I kinda it broke it broke in like a million pieces and one of the bits that I couldnt figure out a properly fix was the part that connected to like the the tripod mount so my fix here is just to permanently attach it to this little gorilla pod your try hot glue Music its totally works okay do you know who Buster Keaton is Buster Keaton is one of my favorite like movie makers of all time hes a guy who hes a kind of started making movies in the movie business when the world of movies was where the world of like YouTube is right now meaning there was like no road map there was no like defined style or like genre you could invent things like vlogging was invented in the last five years and he invented okay whatever just watch this ready Music all right he really hes really doing this like he really did that those stunts are all real theres no special effects like nope thats all like hes actually doing these things and he did this at a time when like nobody knew what motion picture or moving images could be used for and this was the stuff that he would come up with in his head you know much work it must have taken for that one joke but I bring him up because there is definitely a parallel between him a hundred years ago trying to figure out what movies could be and the entire YouTube community right now trying to figure out what can be done here Music okay see this right here just above the beam see the beam just above the beam that is the Japanese the Japanese grocery store its this awesome place that sells all like something you only get in Japan but they import it here but you came and tailed it came and tell its up there look thats a coffee shop and up there where the

just SMACK IT.,2018-04-20T15:47:24Z,9.216666666666667,1633012,59277,Music welcome to 368 on the road from Dublin Ireland never been to Dublin before quite the adventure getting here last night aside we were stuck in the airport for quite quite some time but we made it here happy to be here were here for a very short window of time and its amazing year or supposed to rain its beautiful out so I immediately flew my drone it flew away I specifically told you not to fly Dan specifically told me not to my ways dressed as hes driving we have like like we were both completely like crazy I were both totally delirious from the flight last night but we have like a solid two hours left here in Dublin and were just you know we havent saved between our complaining we feel frayed it to Starbucks Music two hours what should we do this is part of the problem boom no one knows this to everybody weve asked a hundred people every persons like go to the pub get up as I hit a few what should we do here in Dublin well question question what should we do today youre in here in Dublin and what should we do while were in Ireland we have like half a day half a day Music its gonna tomorrow we what day is it today I think its Monday todays Monday yeah weve been here with the understanding that my talk which is why Im here is later this afternoons we have like three hours but like 10 people have come up to us being like Ill see you tomorrow at the top it says yeah but you get picked up yeah yeah yeah Casey were at the main hotel Insurance Tuesday Wednesday this is good news weve been like rushing her up you know good one Mikes exactly the same so they might be a little bit bigger Im not too sure and whats your name Barry Dobson Im an actor and things like that sort stuff so thats what I havent used these cameras but so wait is your talk tomorrow its tomorrow we have an extra day now I think we go back to hotel great are you gonna say the S word no not sleep bring about an upload that you were come on Music I feel like such an idiot now looking at everybody weird you and they said see you tomorrow I was like were gonna be gone tomorrow and now are they gonna see us we are just a couple of total morons today you know what it is its because so we havent taken a key I dont want it I dont wanna do the whole sleeping thing again but but its a thing but hoping I dont know what day it is yeah its a problem with taking overnight flights yeah a little confused ache but its wonderful news because it now means we have an entire day it now means we have an entire day here in Ireland here in Dublin instead of four hours which is what we thought so when I when we realized earlier that we had like a whole day free instead of just a couple hours we thought wed come back here and just reset that was six hours ago weve done six hours of not leaving this room six hours of sitting our computers working six hours of not embracing Dublin but instead can we go to the beach right now you can yeah sure you can take the tram to the train station and then you can fit the train to carry just take a taxi hello sit Im going to the beach yes is that a stupid idea to do were at the seaside it is windy here its amazing the air is like a thick moist look its very cold its like you could like did she have to chew the air before you inhale it but it is lovely here and we made it before the Sun set I Music wish she spent a little bit less time in our hotel room today but were squarely making up for it now Music all right well a little delirious from the jetlag but it is amazing down here now I have a question for you the audience if you could sort of settle something between Dan and I Dan uses a phrase all the time that I dont think its a real usage that anyone else does I think he invented this but he uses the word he uses the word smack and I dont mean like to strike someone with an open hand smack how do you use it like to get things done like lets pack it just smack it come on dude lets smack how did he say to me earlier oh yeah we it could be like when we shooting I could be like should we just smack that time lapse and it means to like just do it that much quicker and that much better yeah its like the poor decision lets smack it in so that means like however were gonna smack it and means like to do it thats not a real thing is it it fully is and and the thing about it is when you commit to smacking it you have to go through you cant be like like Casey on the plane that hes gonna smack hes in it in one hour and then he passes out like if you commit to smacking it you have to go like you have to push through so if you believe in the term lets try and make it into the rocky all no no definitely if enough people want to smack it with me start using the word and eventually it could make it up into some sort of like if everyone just starts smacking at the world would be a better place Music I feel one of the best youve ever had how was it two and a half three it was good what was happening with na Phoenix so Dan asked our taxi driver where we would find a good time tonight neither of us are drinking so its a bit of a crapshoot but were gonna go were gonna go explore its a new friend Im from Germany but I study here doing the masters degree so I shes Irish shes the real Irish sounds like its happening in there I cant go in there

HiS BILLION DOLLAR IDEA,2018-04-15T14:05:57Z,12.566666666666666,2239244,94924,Music theyre literally jackhammering outside my office today I apologize if the sound in this episode is Music Danny and I met in South Africa I was down there visiting Candaces family and he really like showed me around Cape Town and showed me all the awesomeness that kid that had to offer and when he told news come to New York City I kind of promised and Id be like his tour guide Id show them around and one aspect of that Ive just been absolutely failing at is showing them good places to eat so today I take the end of my favorite breakfast restaurant as part one of its 50 part series called KC die sets guide to out of towners to me shes you know sets guide to New York City are you ready for this no I dont even know what youre getting the best breakfast in New York City yes I got all this I got all this herb I got I got all the syrup I got all the serve I got I got all the Sara that juice dan how was it that was incredibly delicious but if I keep on eating like this Im gonna be like Rob   Ill see you at 360 trying to keep away from existentialism John and Earth are trying to keep away from issues flip on the off since walk in the park of discovery I will now read a monologue I didnt write this monologue but its pretty spot on Applause Music so the person who emailed me this morning with a perfectly nice request Im sorry to say the answer is no you didnt do anything wrong you were perfectly respectful within your rights to ask about arranging a time for a meeting see but the problem isnt you theres something wrong with me I have a form of anorexia dont be alarmed its not serious although I take it quite seriously in fact in fact I think its the secret to all of my success I have calendar anorexia I want as little in my calendar as possible Im meticulous about it whatever the least amount possible I can have in my calendar without killing my entire career thats what I want I want to set up quick call to chat want to have coffee next week lets get together to discuss no no and no I could but I just cant even if there are serious opportunities even if the only take me 15 minutes even if its something that everyone else does I like to avoid it of course Im not perfect at this I do succumb just like everybody else in the modern world there are things that I have to do and and those things have to be scheduled there are requirements for work and basic civility but even then when I pull up my phone and I click on todays date and I see little boxes of time blocked out I get very nervous I get anxious what is all this where did my time go what about my day why did I agree to all of this and then the most fearful question how will I be able to make my video you see my entire day is my vlog time I cant schedule that and if I do schedule that away it better be because Im getting paid or I really want to do it because everything else everything else is for suckers see youve got managers and you got makers there are two ways to run your life managers know that their days divided up into little itty bitty pieces for meetings calls and administrative tasks makers on the other hand makers need to have large blocks of uninterrupted time to focus on what it is theyre making when people ask how Im able to get these videos done every single day my calendar and erect SIA is the answer same goes the house able to manage a healthy relationship with my wife and my family and how I manage to exercise and read time time is our most irreplaceable asset we cant buy more of it we cant get a second of it back we can only hope to waste as little of it as possible while we have it yet somehow we treat it as the most renewable of all resources so if the ask is if we can get together and chat or pick my brain the answer is no Im sorry but I have this condition I hope you understand okay I didnt write that its not amazing my friend Ryan Holliday is a brilliant writer hes the one who wrote that hes good so I said hi and while Im not as Extreme as like that letters written theres a lot in there that I do agree with after time with my family and focusing on my family this blog is my number one priority and it does make it hard or frustrating whats up harder frustrating to try and have meetings or give time to everybody who asks for some of my time but every once in a while theres a really good exception to that rule whats up Casey my name is jack conte I am the CEO of patreon but actually this is not a patreon video this is just me and you Ive got an idea and I want to talk to you Music this is it Casey this is it Im asking for 50 minutes of your time just you and me so I can explain this idea and I hope youre down because I already bought my plane ticket so if youre not Im gonna be really lonely on Thursday in New York if you are down just write a comment in this youtube video that just says yes and Ill figure out how to get in touch a few up that video was made by a guy named jack conte now I dont know Jack I dont know who he is Ive never met him as far as I know Ive never seen the guy before and before I could gather from that video he wants something from me but that video was just so so good that I got to meet the guy how good was it well it was so good that the video itself went viral it was so good that he recruited people all over the internet to petition me just to go meet him it was so good so good that the man right now is outside my office door holy crap oh my oh my god I wish everybody could see what it looks like in here this is Jack whats up Jack woody what do you want what do I want what do you want that is so important that you made a video thats that good to get my attention well ultimately what I want is I want creative people to be valued what theyre actually valued at I want I want there to be a zero gap between what a creative person is worth and the money that they are given by the world thats the noble mission yes I want all creators to be able to make a living doing what they love which is I assume creating so how do you realize that well just a pitch for patreon no I dont want to pitch me okay okay Jack is the CEO of a company called patreon patreon patreon patreon is a site if you dont know were like let me know if this is the fare carry it to it yeah patreon is a site where you can like make your own account and then if people like you and they like your YouTube channel they can subscribe to you on patreon and support you by that good yeah they give you much like its like a you get a membership platform wait I I dont like to I cant why dont you find my pitch but not like this do you want to fill in the pitch can you give it a brief yet it fits my audience theyre dying to know this video Jack had 11 000 subscribers he uploaded this video to his channel it went crazy viral it did 600 700 thousand views youre up to fifty nine hundred thousand views nine hundred thousand views you know how many subscribers you are now 50 thousand and fifty thousand people are so curious to hear what you wanted to share with me I need to I have Im a storyteller Casey I have I built a whole story youre on an elevator with my with my 9 million subscribers you want them to believe in what youre sharing pink bum youve got 14 floors go okay this is like Shark Tank Casey three six eight guys the potential to be most badass media company in the world the old school style amazing media companies Im talking about like the late the labels that actually helped developed an artist help them reach an audience help them make money thats what three six eight can actually do youre talking about helping small creators three six eight can be a platform for small creators like no black record label in the world can actually do you can actually help people find and build an audience literally no one in the world can do that three six eight is positioned to be literally a historical media company that can help connect people with the world okay so heres the patient go heres the pitch this is I need to tell you my story I need I need my deck okay okay guys so far this is pretty impressive stuff coming from Jack were gonna go ahead and hit pause so I can read his deck now Im gonna turn the camera off turn the camera off attach in the camera all right that was an hour of the two of us talking I feel like progress was made we made a lot of progress 1 2 3 6 8 lets see 3 6 8 welcome to 3 6 8 oh my god Music so this is the main space and obviously were gonna use this space for like collabs and just like a party space in a physical space up here there thats with no no behind you thats where the office is being built see them up there the constructions almost done up there progress is being made dude its so weird to actually be here so you can imagine like this is where I wanted to podcast and set up back here out there I dont know but I feel like downstairs is about post production clean organized and upstairs about like horsing around and action you can see the vision right babys down you know like the office is built the office is a reality now and then were gonna start working on down here and then upstairs and then and how long is it going to take to actually get the facility up and running weeks and months but not longer than that this isnt a this isnt a five year plan this is like a couple month to it glad somebody else appreciates this phase as much as I do so I think while the good news is I dont know its not that we have a deal or dont have a deal but what Jack came here to present is wildly exciting and I could see it I do see it I want it to be a big part of three six eight future so what do you think I think Im pretty excited right now appreciate you thank you sir this is very exciting this is all about the future of 368 and what we could do together and Im spinning I gotta go on tomorrows episode of three six eight

368 THE UNANSWERED QUESTION?,2018-04-12T12:57:28Z,9.533333333333333,1516168,62159,how many sugars how many sugars no sugar today is a very very special episode coming to you we are in Chicago right

name handsome aiya say something awesome smile I love the city Music all right kind of an amazing and super positive change of plans dan and I found bicycles Chicago is one of my favorite cities because it has yeah okay you need to look up what the blue mind theory is as such being surrounded by a large space of water actually brings your levels of anxiety down thats why I search when were standing at the sea taking it in quietly it takes away our stress its one of the reasons why we love the ocean so much do you feel happier since we got to the lake so much happy okay very exciting because were here in Chicago and I dont really have anything to do it seemed like today would be a great day for the first ever 3 6 8 QA joining me today is Dan hey look forward to yoga oh Im looking for Im looking forward to questions also we didnt shoot a proper QA intro for 316 yeah boo did shoot this little nugget Music so those of you new around here I usually ask via Twitter you can follow me on twitter my link is a great question from Jason Caron öthey what do you in Canada is planning on starting the podcast I would say realistically the podcast will be started within the next two weeks and the podcast will have a video component in addition to like the regular podcast which we would download and listen to his audio weird a video too so what is done actually do out there what what is Dan actually do aside sleep Dans just like my homie from South Africa whenever Im in Cape Town visiting we make movies together he told me he was coming to visit New York City and I was like Im starting this series just being a homey thats what Dan does how many people do you plan on employing at 3 6 8 large ask that question Lars I plan on employing as few of people as possible to make that place run like a well oiled machine when you have too many people your responsibilities become management instead of action and I hate managing people okay this one is dear to my heart will Joe be joining you in New York City Joe is Dans dog lets cuts a photo of him so you can yes this is how manys Christmas Jes I guess I mean half horse case you dont fish yes I would love to have your puppy in the office I just dont know how to get a dog here from hes an old man okay theres been a lot of questions about me sleeping continuously in the vlog or looking like Im half asleep hey thats just me but also a fool sleeps when hes tired and a wise man sleeps when he can and I think that yeah 3 6 8 we pushing so hard every single day every single second that I have the chance to sleep even if its on the side of the pavement I take that opportunity will Candice make more appearances on three six eight yes what the is that hair and all caps Sami Im with you this is just a terrible haircut I had here the blonde and this is my only option where do you see this in one year this is in three six eight my goal for 316 is to have this be a 500 episode series which means one year from now Ill still be doing this what are what are your plans for YouTube damn I think that Im Im super lucky to have Casey as as a homie and Im here kind of learning from him which has been a crazy experience and what Im gonna do with all that knowledge within the next month Im gonna start weekly uploading on my channel will 3 6 8 be entirely edited by Casey or will other creators upload their content the mission is about a space and is about collaboration but 3 6 8 the series this series this is my series so you know I love collaborating with people like Dan and in the future therell be other collaborations but 3 6 8 the series will always be will always be my series ok last question heres a good one from Zack Bennett how do you all foresee the content in 3 6 8 different from that of the original vlogs Zack I think its very similar to the original vlogs but the ambition is very different I want to tell a much bigger story than just my story with 3 6 8 its just going to take time 3 6 8 the the vision the company that everything right now is nothing but an empty space as my ideas start to become reality I think youll see this Daily Show going directions that take it that take it away from what people came to understand as the vlog Music Navy Pier I have no idea what that means Music theres one more question that came in that kind of broke my heart and I want to address it goes like this its from smoking Joe how would I be as good as you when my life isnt very interesting and I cant afford decent recording editing equipment I cant seem to gain any growth after two years of hard work hard work and patience are really whats required to find success in any field in life two years is a very small amount of time and you gotta be prepared to commit everything if you want to stick it out do we have to get out I had such a good answer to me creativity is the ability to be able to believe in the way in which you see the world so much that you actually create an art format and from what I understand like video is an is an outlet its a voice poems arent outlets music may be an outlet its its a personal perception of the world and the creation around that that becomes interesting and I think that like youve just got to keep at it theres so many different ways of finding execution and people that will find your work and platforms but if you just keep and stay true to yourself and the way in which you see things and thats your what your videos are about thats interesting that you need thats bloody beautiful Music Applause Music Music damn what did you think of your tour of Chicago Chicagos rad that you are possibly the worst to a guy Music on tomorrows episode of three six eight hey I want to come I want to come pick up the bikes today can I do that I rode my bicycle fast Oh

why dont you move me a key go by and Ill cover the bit cuz you know I spent money I dont have and if I was throw me all the Frenchs I dont grab but the water on the way down I dont contribute day 1 when you would say myself ok early morning bagel run Ive got some kind of kind of bad news about 368 I mean sighs its not that big of a deal but it just kind of sucks see construction was supposed to start today with like contractors and construction workers and plans and architects and all that stuff but I just found out last night that um theres like an issue with our insurance so we had to delay by like maybe a week maybe up to ten days I guess its not that big of a deal it just kind of sucks but here at 368 we do things by the books we dont take chances we follow the rules now I have always said that the gear doesnt matter when it comes to telling stories making videos YouTube and everything in between the story you tell is always more important than what you used to tell it steven soderbergh big like Hollywood movie director hes the guy who directed Oceans eleven and like 20 other huge movies he shot his latest feature film like a proper thriller movie theater horror movie he shot a lot of cell phone and hes famously said that the future of filmmaking is on cell phones and thats the vision I really subscribe to so I think its something that thats accessible to all of us and its also a very good segue to a new segment thats going to come to you every Tuesday here on three six eight called tech review Tuesday Dan roll your new sweet intro Casey asked me to make some sort of a kick ass intro phrase tech Tuesday segment but I completely forgot Im not really worried there because hes not gonna see this until this video goes alive next weeks tech Tuesday intro sequence will be sick I promise hope you guys like that intro Dans been working on it all week long all right now on Facebook Ive been seeing this video pop up like had a really annoying video you notice for this hyper zoom lens that you can put on your cell phone Music and watching that just like theres no teen way that thing works so I went ahead and ordered one record of a better world together with you a lot of stuff in this box I got this whole kit off of Amazon for thirty five dollars and 49 cents maybe thats why Im so skeptical of it okay back to the unboxing Music at 35 bucks I just dont trust that if you have to do what they say its gonna be able to do but I maintain open mind Music made it up before Im giving me the dishes water and the cup dont get too much for this bins and theres two people around me acquaintances to the game and Im enjoying someone chuck is over to a good man Im enjoying someones kids out which way to grin I mean its a chilling April day Sam its a little dramatic draw goggles face faster I need someplace like cinematic I think in the far into this pier so this goes on to here presumably like centered perfectly okay and now this just kind of screws on that on there oh and then one of those is an adapter maybe make it wider dude I cant believe you actually fell for like one of those Facebook ads like you see them all the time youre like thats just garbage its like its the new as seen on tv thing but yeah you actually bought it and dude if you actually get this centered properly I lets test it all right so this you be a side by side comparison of the 35 Facebook infomercial lens on a cell phone in a 1000 super zoom lens on a TV 700 Canon camera body Music Music Music well color me impressed its not a total piece of    for 35 bucks as like sort of a gag but it it actually works thats the thing that you put it on and you can get what is a 20x zoom on here 18 X zoom shot diversity is wildly underrated when it comes to making YouTube videos and having a long lens is important and if all you have is a cell phone this could prove helpful so I very gently very reluctantly recommend this total piece of thirty five dollar lens because it sort of almost works Music now we have a fun family activity planned for the afternoon I got a food that needs fell into some time to kill why dont you move me a key go by and Ill cover the bit cuz you know Im gonna spend the money I dont have and if almost throw me all that branches I dont grab put the water in the bottom boil go ahead at the bottom and Ill float to the top bar right crystal commercial Liberty Science Center its like a Childrens Museum the trick to this place is you come about two hours before closing that way no one else is here Brandon what do I need to show my daughter in here how old is your daughter three three yeah she definitely needs to keep playing with the Train okay I would take her downstairs to the third floor go to eat erbium thats our miniature zoom and if shes over 42 inches you could definitely go on your penny come over here all right thank you youre welcome all right oh man I dont know who gave me two it could be you it could be someone else you could put it on yours or put it on the shelf I could go it alone or I could use some help I could bring you home or I could bring myself and if me to go Ill probably listen to you find myself all by myself again with nothing to do write it down this hall look Im sorry honey youre not tall enough thats perfect Music oh you dont tell them hi is it Archer ready okay Music Im tired and unsure as to whether to talk to you I tried before but only managed to Bajoran LA come you look so confident when you written that a bite song hard and flinch cuz Ive been that what were you today man

368 THE FIRST EPISODE,2018-04-06T12:26:31Z,10.9,3004071,157938,Music Music Im still running still running every single day I know I had talked about running on this channel in a while but nothings changed the dream is still to run into a very old age or until my legs explode you have to uh you gotta fix this you know fix this glass glass got six the glass welcome to 360 so over but Music so three six eight we have a lot of work to do here its a gigantic barren space that used to be an office space and we have to turn it into like a fun house we have to turn in like a production studio or turn into like a music studio I want to build like a store in the front here that people can come visit but well we havent started yet let me introduce you to the weed okay this is the hole we so far were gonna build a team were gonna have like people to do stuff but we really have well we cant really afford it yet and this is the we supply this is damn by the way Im cheap because Im South African I guess you might remember Dan from South Africa hes the guy I go surfing with hes always messing with me saying theres great white sharks we going to shock invested Bay Shark Island sharp shot big shot Sharky bit great white sharks sharks I always very just Whitney that he just shows you this what is this the shark but then Ill show you actually Ill show you the article and this is a friend of yours yeah wait for it there we go what happened seal point shark attack and this is a friend like a proper friend of yours you will fall for for the video yes huge bass trade not keen with Casey how often to somebody Epis by a shark in South Africa surface it depends like five six times a year it really does happen it happens and properly happens and this is my granite leg you see you smoke there yeah whats worked what hes makes the news we dont even have like mediums like big YouTube and you got to make it famous get bitten by a shark so thats Dan Music Music dan is like a creative genius hes a friend of mine and he just moved to New York City so I dont know what his role is yet in 3 6 8 but for now hes just trying to my partner in crime I came out wearing the shirt I made for you what  poet nut in crime but I have to wear this thing every day look boss or any man that the custom me custom made t shirt do the natives are over on now you put it in my college fund well I didnt have any periods either those are sharpies so Dan and I will be figuring out our sort of professional relationship in due time but for now partnering crime pee I see Music more practices I think you got it dont touch the blades and drive it hard all right turn it over Music Laughter Music now youve seen this space before you know this space I effectively want to take it from what was just an office space and turn it into something much much much more just such a huge amount of space listen to this echo I want it to be like a physical space I want to do sports back here like really skateboard back here I want a basketball hoop back here I want like I want to be able to do stuff back here theres a kitchen but this kitchens only ever been a place to like come and have a snack or or juice but why not build a real kitchen where you can cook in to have events in like dinner parties and just a place to socialize med down here theres a little nostalgic down here but why not have a place where my creator friends from out of town can can work or editor I dont do whatever they need to do down here and then over here the reason why I cant aside I have a podcast yes we dont have anything set up what if we build our podcasting studio back here and not what if we are building our podcasting studio back here its just I remember when I first moved to New York City how much I learned to appreciate space because theres none of it here having to edit in a bedroom that I shared with another person in an apartment that I share with four other people space is the most elusive thing and when I got my studio upstairs it was like the crowning achievement of my entire life when I got that 10 12 years ago and now this idea that I have this big gigantic space thats not just about me but something bigger than me something that can maybe enable creators or like the creator community here in New York City sucks and I think because theres no central location maybe this can be a part of motivating all of that like all the things Ive ever wanted to do and done and struggle to do in the world of videos and and YouTube and everything else like this is my go at that it would refer to working you a physical space Music no Sam Schaffer hate this so true theres so much I just this is incredible this is ladies and gentlemen Sam Sheppard Sam here is absolutely one of the founding members of the 3 6 8 squad look at this guy Music I just this is incredible this is Im just like I just want to just rip off my dad were gonna look at him go look at him go oh you know I was just like I was just having a heart to heart with the camera here and I was saying that like maybe the reason why the creator community New York City sucks so bad is because theres no like its not centralized what if this can become the space for like all creators I come here work what do you need we got it oh yeah oh yeah yo yeah if you want to go upstairs and get all my electric vehicles I dont have anywhere to put anybody you want to come upstairs and help us bring down some electric vehicles we can raise them I guess that license that song now Music you can see it in here ready guys I know this kind of is my new job but I got to get back to work now playtimes over for now sorry you ready yeah for what to go home yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well I say yeah cuz Im American how do you

WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME ON YouTube !!,2018-04-05T12:00:02Z,6.083333333333333,2513288,162947,Transcript not available,0.0,N/A,,,WVHbHzGDs7Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVHbHzGDs7Q
Some thoughts on the shooting at Youtube,2018-04-04T18:48:42Z,5.816666666666666,1855440,65845,so today was the day today Wednesday April 4th 2018 was the day that I was going to release my video announcing what Im doing next on this channel announcing like my new daily vlog and all the exciting things that Im gonna be doing on YouTube in the near future and then yesterday I was out sitting with Dan my editing partner and were finalizing this this announcement video we learned of what happened yesterday in San Bruno at YouTube headquarters we learned about the shooting and it certainly affected me in such a way that I couldnt have couldnt boats the video the next day that was about celebrating and fun and all the things that I want to do here without first acknowledging acknowledging the events now I I love you too I have a deep profound respect admiration and love for YouTube I credit most of my career and the success that Ive found in life to YouTube and when its provided provided me with and I know that when I say YouTube that most of you think of YouTube the website YouTube is a website but when I say YouTube Im thinking of the people the people that I know at YouTube the people that operate YouTube the people that that make YouTube happen and when I see on the news the helicopter footage of YouTube headquarters in San Bruno I dont see a generic building but I see a building that Ive been in Ive been in multiple times I see a building that Ive walked through the halls of Ive spoken in there Ive shook hands and hung out with and gone down there goofy slide that takes you from one floor to another I see a collection of human beings of incredible human beings a moment when theres a when theres an event an atrocity like this a shooting takes place and you see it on television you see it in the abstract but seeing YouTube on television yesterday was not abstract for me and typically when something like this happens we focus on the people who are injured in the people who are killed and fortunately as of right now no one is no one is dead no one is dead that is besides the the monster that committed sacked so I think I think what it must be like not just for the people who are injured but for the thousands of people that work in that building what yesterday must have been like for them Im Im imagining youre sitting at your desk youre doing your work youre fine to finish what you need to finish to go home and feel good about your day at the job you hear a commotion maybe you hear gunshots there was a report yesterday that it wasnt the gunshots that most people heard it was a shaking they thought it was an earthquake at first it wasnt an earthquake it was the sounds of people running of a lot of people running on the floors above them so you get up and you start running but you dont know where youre running and you dont know why youre running you dont know who youre running from and then you hide you find a place that you think is the best place for you to hide youre hiding with your peers youre hiding with your co workers you dont know what to do now you hear what sounds like police in the building and you you hope that it is police in the building youre trained in these situations youre were taught in these situations that when you hear a knock and someone says its all clear you can come out   first call 9 1 1 to make sure that is indeed a police officer saying all clear and and not an assailant and and thats what you do and it is all clear and and then youre told by that cop to march out of that room maybe an office maybe your office but March out of that room in your place of work with your hands in the air in single file and and not just out of that room but down the hall but through your entire place of work out the front door down the sidewalk and I imagine your their hearts are pounding theyre nervous youre there theyre anxious they dont know what has happened the specifics of whats happened they dont know if their friends are okay and and and once everyones safely evacuated then everybody has to be patted down by police officers to make sure youre not armed but you dont have a weapon and then finally youre youre clear the police tell you youre all set youre clear go over here walk down the sidewalk whatever it is but you dont have your things you just left this office maybe you left your car keys you dont know how to get home so you have to what call call an uber or call a cab and youre sharing a ride with somebody and then finally you make it home you sit down in your couch you sigh a breath of relief and you have to process this and I just cannot imagine how traumatic that must have been but then once you are in your home in a place where youre youre ostensibly safe then you have to start to process whats going to happen tomorrow and when you go back to work or what are the new security measures and more importantly when you go back to work youre going back to what was effectively at least at one point a crime scene and so I think about that I think about all of that I think about what that must be like for these people and certainly not just the people that I know theyre not just the colleagues that I work with because of what I do on YouTube but everybody in that building its those people its everybody in that building that make this website happen that enabled this it is because of their hard work that connects all of us so I have no call to action here I just wanted to make this video to let everyone at YouTube know that Im thinking of them and to say to my audience that I hope you two are thinking of everyone at YouTube whos having to deal with this both directly and indirectly okay so I will see you tomorrow for the launch of or the announcement video of the launch of you know the future of this channel okay and if everyone at YouTube hang in there Im thinking of you were all thinking of

Black Panther; COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW [no spoilers],2018-02-13T14:54:29Z,8.15,1629245,57571,Music its 457 the movie starts at 600 Ive got an hour and three minutes to get there Im a big fan of superhero movies but not a big fan of all superhero movies let me begin in 1989 with Tim Burtons Batman now I was a child when this movie came out but I remember seeing in the theaters and it blew my mind you cant make an omelet without breaking some eggs Ive seen it like 20 times since and it still holds ever dance with the devil in the pan Tim Burtons Batman is definitely one of the best superhero movies ever was it better than 2008 Dark Knight thats a tough one Christopher Nolan levelled up the entire superhero genre with the Dark Knight that bank robbery scene was one of the best bank robbery seems probably since michael manns he also like Jon Favreaus iron man thats iron man won Music the combination of Favreau and Robert Downey jr was was pretty brilliant it was the first time we saw any humor in the superhero genre please no gang size but when it comes to humor in the superhero genre its Deadpool that takes the cake the way that like he even broke down the fourth wall in this movie was genius fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break thats like 16 walls the casting the characters the factory like it was self aware and it kind of picked on the x men and they joked about not having enough budget its funny that I only ever see two of you its almost like the studio couldnt afford another x man the taxi driver yes Ghita the movie is absolutely genius I cant wait to see number 2 now recently I also watched Wonder Woman and I didnt see in the theaters I watched at home with my three year old daughter who also loved it it was just an awesome movie the tie ins with World War 2 in the historical stuff Sam Raimis spider man was good the first one but the other ones I mean I could take him or leave him guardians of the galaxy was also awesome I mean I loved the nostalgic soundtrack and like all the 1980s references it was a great story as far as superhero movies go they really they delivered alright thats it for my superhero masks by the way all those superhero masks for that quick scene they cost hundred and eighty six dollars Im gonna try and return them but the expectations for Black Panther tonight theyre on a different level and theyre on a different level because of one reason and that is Ryan Coogler Ryan Coogler is the director of Black Panther now Ryans only made two other movies the first movie was a movie called Fruitvale station it was so good that it honestly made me not want to make feature films I know that Im not capable of telling a story the way that he told that story that was his first movie his second movie was Creed the rocky movie the Philadelphia movie the Creed is kind of the only movie that Ive seen that I can remember literally in the theaters Candis and I standing up and applauding at the screen so I have to I have to leave in four minutes to go meet Aquila but expectations extremely high for tonights screening Music Candis is Lake Superior movies so Im bringing my friend akela as my date look at this picture she just posted on Twitter she um she painted her fingernails to look like black panther she painted tiny black panthers on her fingernails and that thats how I know I I picked the right day Kim yeah a lot of people showing up for this preview screening yeah preview tonight preview are you excited for it all right Music Akilah seems pretty confident that we just cut the whole line I was outside waiting she wasnt God this all I need thank you expectations best movie since the Dark Knight thats what you think its gonna fit in I think its gonna be like that like like Atari Dark Knight was the last like seminal supergirls yes and I did like were gonna be quoting and were gonna be referencing it for a decade every day at what point in time I can he yelled at for bringing a huge camera and microphone into a preview screening of a movie I feel like the moment we reach the top of this escalator its gonna happen hmm sir you put that camera away sorry sorry what did he sit this wait theres tape here what we do over I think the movie is about to begin were not allowed to film during the movie no were not Music yeah Music my son it is your time okay this is the comprehensive review coming at you from Aquila and Casey I mean it was it was what we predicted which is like I think a game changing not just superhero movie like every foe I mean the special effects the colors I think thats where you start the character development no they never take characters that find superhero I mean no like really we would have everybodys backstory times 20 Michael B Jordan as the as the villain best superhero villain since Heath Ledger at in yeah with the complete the Joker I mean it was like a deep you felt yeah I was like okay you like no oh and fight sequences were spot on you Peter Longo was like pretty unbelievably fabricated character she plays a spy thats not giving anyway no I mean okay theres a reason why it has like ninety nine percent on Rotten Tomatoes it really is all its cracked up to be were trying to keep this review spoiler alert frame no okay on a scale of one is it four stars or five stars its a four star like hotels 5 stars for like rating okay okay on a scale of one to five stars we give it a resounding you,126.87116564417177,comprehensive,0.0,1.0,rgqU0MbRLDo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgqU0MbRLDo
Interviewing the Head of YouTube Business,2018-02-12T15:06:57Z,19.05,3874683,174368,just a quick preface here this interview took place twelve days ago now so any reference in this interview to Logan Paul or Logan Paul controversy is in reference to the events that transpired around the first of the year the Japanese forests not at all referencing the more recent Logan Paul controversy and and subsequent D monetization of his channel none of that is reference because that all happened after this interview took place while I would love to know more specifically whats around YouTube with these recent events unfortunately this interview took place before they happened hope thats clear okay heres the interview alright welcome ah have you ever made a YouTube video before no its my first one Im always very vocal with what I see as YouTube YouTube strengths and YouTube shortcomings and as Chris around Christmas and New Years when all the logan paul stuff was going down and there was a lot of criticism of youtubes PR and everything else i e mailed robert here and said why not use the platform as a way to communicate youtubes positions on these things in its outlook for the future and he said thats a great idea and this is sort of a first stab at that he offered thank you to come on my youtube channel and talk about the future of youtube and answer whatever questions I had is that fair that is absolutely fair and Im so happy to be here so thanks for its actually your idea it wasnt my idea it was yours and and its risky but today thats thats what do you guys do risky stuff every day tell us who you are I think most youtubers and they think of YouTube leaderships they know Susan but people dont know you so who are you and what do you do sure so Im Robert Kinsel Im chief business officer of YouTube and in my day to day job Im responsible for all the YouTube creators and and and content partners who are making their living on YouTube and creating amazing audiences so all of your problems are my problems your wins or my wins so we are tied at the hips and and I just love what I do I think most people collect most peoples questions have to do with the Logan Paul controversies its still very very fresh and to leave that off Im curious whats it like for you and then whats it like inside of YouTube when something like that or any of the previous controversies happen is there a protocol in place yeah I mean we have depending on on severity of the issue at hand we have escalation processes that take place and and were looking at you know how this how this works against the guidelines the community guidelines that we have set on YouTube which really help operate an open platform like ours theres theres quite a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes that the rest of the world doesnt see how did it how did it land on the home page I think you have there are no simple answers to that except that there was a lot of interest in that video there were a lot of search searches for it all around the world on YouTube and it ended up there I think was nine days between it happening and you guys responding to it how about you better so so we actually we had a we had a press reply the next day within in less than 24 hours but our social response was delayed and so what we were working on is we were trying to formulate our our response and of course you know with Logan and a lot of his projects for original productions there are hundreds of people involved people whose paychecks depend on it so we dont want to make a rash decision that impacts so many peoples livelihood its not just Logan many other people are cross multiple projects however we do want to be much faster were looking at those processes and and and we want to be much more active there was a line in that statement you guys put out an unsocial that said well have more to share soon on the steps were taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated and I think that line of video like this had a lot of the community questioning what that means and this is a bigger question which is how do you how do you balance kind of being the thought police saying this is okay and this is not versus free speech which is are like YouTube is stood for so much so and and youre youre hitting the nail on the head which this is one of the hardest things scaling open is developing standards making sure that users feel safe creators feel safe and advertisers feel safe obviously this video was not something that you know and I dont think anyone you know anyone is proud of proud to be associated with but we think that the more we develop our Community Guidelines the more we hone them and there will our standards along those lines we think we we can get their culture YouTube culture Ive noticed sort of in the last year last year plus drama has been drama would be the descriptor out used to really drive the culture of YouTube what do you think of that I found that are you talking about the drama you create drama is rewarded with use drama is rewarded with attention drama is rewarded ultimately with dollars and I think a lot of that is what what eventually sort of metastasized into the kind of sensationalist content that let things like the Logan Paula controversy happen yeah how do you how does YouTube affect culture it to Im talking about the incentives and disincentives for that or thinking very deeply and every single day now on how do we create the right incentives and disincentives for creators to to do the right thing on YouTube and that means a lot of different things that means do the right things for advertisers do the right things for their users you know for the platform organically and not chase sensationalism not chase views for the sake of views not use drama for the sake of use and not use drama at our expense for the sake of use it so whats at heart for us is that we deeply care about the Train Riko system thats my job if you dont succeed we dont succeed what we want to make sure that creators who are making a living on YouTube feel safe doing so you know that theres no gaming basically that its just all about like doing the right thing and it is our job to set those guidelines in place and the incentives in place so so were working that quite busily what kind of creators would you like to see more of on the platform are you talking about me personally or   the bigger question of culture like whoa what would you love to see ultimately is kind of the defining creator movement on the platform and how would how would you how would you to foster the kind of relationships needed to enable I so I personally like a lot of news content news related content on YouTube it just you know helps catch up on everythings going on and its just and it has a different Flair on YouTube educational content but I dont mean the traditional educational says its just that I Ive learned something new my older daughter who became vegan and you know we didnt want them to become vegan and and and then you know them you know because its a lot of work Penda and you know she found all the inspiration and all the arguments and how to argue and convince parents on YouTube by the way the one category I didnt mention is and we would like more and more female creators on the platform right that yeah its its a huge opportunity huge and and so Elle Mills have you discovered Ella Mills yet and by the way every time you told me that I remember the last time you said oh you know you gotta watch this this kind david dobrik this was like three years ago it was like hes on the rise and of course yeah so I know youd have an eye for it so Ill make sure to follow her no but thats thats another category that we really focused on what what do we want to grow in we want everybody to grow but what do we want to grow a little bit more that maybe is underserved that maybe needs the extra push extra push in terms our attention extra push in terms of marketing count them funding whatever it is and then we put somebody on it and say build a plan they build a plan approve the plan and then they start executing against it thats really thats how the process with us works this is a big kind of this is a big question I have that Ive always had which is that in all my years in television I never met a TV studio head who wasnt at one time a TV producer and in cinema Ive never met a movie studio and who didnt produce movies but no one on the YouTube sort of senior executive leadership side has ever made a living as a creator so how do you how does Susan how do the other leaders at YouTube empathize with the struggles of being a creator having never been there yourself so I might not have produced myself but I just give you my little quick background I started in the mailroom of a talent agency working with writers actors directors States tickling their pictures and resumes and sending it to cast entities that Sarah became an assistant and just went to work for a production movie production financing companies have made a lot of films and and then went to HBO and launched HBOs around the world and eventually to Netflix and then to YouTube so Ive been around content all of my professional career and and Ive learned it from inside out and every angle so Im deeply passionate about it I love it and thats my both my professional and personal life now when it comes to when it comes to but I have now been a YouTube creator myself when you think about YouTube its really a massive platform its a technology like its massive technological feat and what you really need is people who are incredibly proficient at building an infrastructure on a you know unprecedented level all around the world of interesting 450 hours of video every single minute is streaming in billion hours a day in HD quality so what our company has to do is sort of marry the technological prowess with content prowess together and and do it at scale the changes in the partner program so you have to have four thousand hours of watch time a thousand subs to monetize a question or something I saw a lot on on Twitter was new or tiny YouTube channels seeing that is tremendously discouraging how do you how do you respond to that so we dont succeed unless you succeed if there are no great creators theyre not gonna be enough users theres not enough advertisers it just it doesnt work so we we think that this level is high enough for us to learn about the partner so that we can turn the ads on them and not disappoint advertisers and at the same time that its not so far out that it will be untenable and you know and unreachable for that we want as many creators monetizing but we also want to make sure that everybody whos monetizing is doing the right thing and and its protective because if somebody doesnt do the right thing and are in there and that vert eyes is react in a certain way then all of you get punished thats not a good outcome because then you dont succeed we dont succeed because nobody is happy um about monetization when you guys made the changes that were made in response to ad pocalypse theres a lot of frustration a lot of frustration expected expressed on social media did you guys see that outcry coming for the false positives did it catch you off guard it was really really hard because if youre just trying to stabilize the ecosystem thats you know thats thats moving around so yes we heard the outcry of course and and its the I can tell you theres nothing more painful than hear from the advertisers their stories and nothing more painful is than hear from the creators and and you should know both sides think that we favor the other you know and so we clearly have work to do it does feel like at times that what creators want to make what audiences want to see doesnt always align or doesnt align what advertisers want to want to buy against how do you how do you rectify that some sometimes that happens and and its really hard to tell an advertiser look you must buy this and because they sell it guess my brand and I just dont want to you know thats their choice one of the one of the things that we worked really hard on last year was our yellow monetization icon because then really which I know might have been you know painful and worked but it was something that helped us reduce false positives by 30 percent it was really impactful you know suddenly getting getting input from creators saying look this was not correct everyone who participated let me ask you about the yellow icon because from a creator from the most cynical creator perspective what it what a few does is a way of saying we think this might not be advertiser friendly so were gonna cut your revenue on it but were still playing it so its costing you the its costing you the Creator money while we figure this out and I think that I know I as a creator found that very insulting Ive known that very upsetting why do I have to take your algorithms mistake why does it have to cost me money how does YouTube address something like that at the kind of scale that I remember you are calling on this issue I think those may be October and were there yeah and and thats when we start to think about the lets lets lets you know what stole creators that they shouldnt you know published them yet have them unlisted I guess with you its cant and and then you know they wont go through the volatility so that that has worked if you as a creator it feels like theres a lot of tension between the creator community and YouTube as a company is that is that felt do you think its a fair statement is that felt within YouTube as a company I wouldnt want to call it tension because it would it would imply that were on opposite sides somehow and were not I think were on the same side the thing that we have struggled with and youve told that to me multiple times is communication and you should know that we try so hard to communicate with creators but its only so disheartening but like we want feedback to keep on coming but its disheartening to hear that its not cutting through but you should know that we dont see this tension we see it as if people are not happy we have a problem were on the same side we need to figure out how to fix it well let me let me end then with this this this and this question this is more of a prompt than a question but I think that YouTubes never been good at saying heres what matters to us heres what we stand for and heres what to expect from us so I invite you to now just kind of use this platform as a way to tell all of us creators in the community what matters to you what do you stand for and what is next for YouTube as as a platform sure so so what we stand for is is really four freedoms freedom of opportunity anybody to make a living on YouTube you know bring revenue from the entire world and there are many wonderful examples freedom of speech as important as ever freedom of information accessing it I grew up in in communist country in Czechoslovakia behind the Iron Curtain its really important you know the openness and freedom of speech and freedom of information is really important to me and that that is why I I love what I do and then the fourth one is freedom to belong people creating communities on YouTube that they can feel like they can share a bit more with that they may not have in person somewhere else but on the YouTube they do so we have these four core freedoms that we truly care about what what is important to us is the success of our partners the partners our creators and advertisers so to us whats most important is bringing these two communities together advertisers and creators and make sure that they all succeed and if they do well be fine and everything that I say is like that you know were on your side we mean it we may not get it right you know many times or for one reason or another but the intent is always good the intent is always on your side and so hopefully we can deliver more and and truly make everybody even happier and more successful well Robert thank you for coming on and I want to say that Robert did not ask me to do this but I cant have you on Robert without plugging your book stream Punks by reading this book I got to understand how you think of YouTube and that means a lot considering youre the one pulling all the strings and then the second thing that I like the most and I wish you had talked more about it I think its just the first chapter of the preface or something is when you talk about your upbringing in here behind the Iron Curtain and not having any access to media at all in the first movie that you ever saw was terminator but it was dubbed and checked nanika I thought oh say Oh same here jonah had an understanding that thats where youre coming from and now that youre in the position you were in enables me to empathize with you and by proxy with youtube and more so Thank You Casey thanks for having me here to do this is Jay all right thanks for watching if you made it that far I just want to put this at the end to again Thank You Tube thank Robert for doing this and then also to encourage YouTube to do more of this there are a lot of other creators in this platform that I know would love to interview some of the senior management at YouTube and there is certainly enough controversy taking place in this platform to warrant those interviews so I know it may not make the most interesting or fun video but I do think this is an effective way for YouTube to share what the hell is going on within that company to us to the community so thanks YouTube okay tomorrow I will be back to my regular programming,177.16535433070865,sensationalist,0.0,1.0,ycuMyyqBWQY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycuMyyqBWQY
about Logan Paul,2018-02-09T13:00:00Z,5.016666666666667,5973095,237051,we interrupt this program to bring you a special report Im sorry about the title of this video but let me explain back around the new year when all the logan paul was going down i obviously as a person as a human being i was frustrated and pissed off and offended by his actions I felt as I imagine most of you felt how I felt as a youtuber as a creator as somebody who depends on this platform I was nervous and I was anxious as to how Logans actions might negatively affect the entire platform with that anxiety I waited for you to respond I wanted to hear what they had to say and I waited and I waited and I waited ultimately they did they did post a response it was a little over a week later in the form of five tweets something they called an open letter and that open letter started by them saying many of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently and youre right to be while I appreciated their self awareness ultimately I was I was left completely unsatisfied by what they had to say by the ambiguity of the letter there was nothing there theres no substance to it they didnt really say anything they didnt answer the questions that I had as a creator so rather than doing what I would normally do which is make a video thinking about or go on Twitter complaining about it I emailed YouTube and I didnt just generically email YouTube but I emailed the top executive at YouTube in charge of all creators hes a guy named Robert Kinsel and hes the chief business officer of YouTube so you got Susan Wojcicki whos the CEO and theyve got Robert whos the CEO and together they run the entire company but its Robert who handles everything that touches us creators that touches the entire community thats his responsibility and in that email I expressed to him my frustration and my disappointment and how YouTube had handled communicating what was going on throughout the entire controversy and this definitely wasnt the first time I brought up YouTubes poor communication skills to hit theyre great people who are definitely used to hearing me complain this time instead of just complaining I had a suggestion or a challenge I suggested that he come here to New York City to my office and we would talk about YouTube on camera I wanted to ask him personally the questions I had about this platform especially after the Logan Paul controversy and I wanted to make a video about it that I put on this channel and to my absolute surprise he accepted so this coming Monday February 12 2018 I will be posting that interview in its entirety here on this channel its its long I asked a lot of questions and Robert had a lot to say and I do want to say that I took this opportunity extremely seriously you know just judging by whats happened in my own career in the last couple of weeks Im very quick to acknowledge that I am NOT the best journalist out there so I did ask a couple of my friends some of which are professional journalists and some of which are youtubers who I think would have smart perspectives on this and thats how I put together my questions and I dont think my questions were easy I asked him the questions that I think any creator would asked if you were given the opportunity to speak to the person at the very top the person with the ability to change alter move anything on this platform now this is definitely a first for me to the best of my knowledge this kind of thing is a first for YouTube and I want to end this little preview this little explanation video by just acknowledging a huge huge huge risk for him and for YouTube to come here and and talk to me on the record so thats it like I said the video will be posted in just a couple of days you know just some of the pragmatic parts I didnt share any of my questions with YouTube with Robert I didnt share any of the questions ahead of time they didnt know what they were getting themselves into with with what I was going to be asking them and when Robert finally showed up here when he walked through the door to my office he was with his head of PR for all of YouTube and the first question that I asked them was with the cameras off the first question I asked them was whats off limits what do you not want me asking you and and Robert looked me in the eye I wasnt wearing glasses he looked me in the eye and said nothings off limits ask whatever you want to ask I hope youll give this video the time that it deserves I hope you will give YouTube sort of a chance to hear out what they want to say about this whole everything thats been around in this platform and whether you like what he has to say or not I think that his willingness and YouTubes willingness to come and speak so openly speaks volumes okay Im very very excited to share this with with all of the Internet you,182.59136212624585,responsibility,0.0,1.0,7kLO2AB5SPM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kLO2AB5SPM

would I dont want to dwell on that I want to move forward but I do want to say Im not a part of the company anymore but the same amazing team that was always there is still there and theyre still working on making the best content they can possibly make so if you like the stuff that they were making know theyre still making it and maybe go over their channel which is linked below and show them a little bit of love they just posted a video today which is really funny I have a short cameo in it its funny please show a little support for those guys now whats next for me I dont know yet Im not there yet but I have spent some time focusing on whats most important to me and whats most important to me is being around the people that I care about the most and theres one person who I really care about my best friend from high school my og homie Joe who I never see so last week when the New England Patriots won the hook I understand if you dont like the Patriots just take it easy in the comments below its Joes favorite team when the Patriots won the championship and I found out they were going to the Super Bowl I thought of Joe hes the biggest Patriots fan in the world and I came up with this idea to drive to Connecticut and surprise him with two tickets to the Super Bowl thats right Im taking my homie to the Super Bowl two and a half hour drive so I should be getting there like 1030 1100 just as his shift in the restaurant isnt Im looking forward to seeing him but Im not looking forward to this car ride perfectly perfectly reasonable question its only the most watched sporting event in the history of the United States of America zeeky zeeky hooked it up this is a sponsored video this is an ad advertisement hashtag ad I called C key I told me about Joe I told him the whole idea like long shot can you get me tickets and they they literally said yes amazing if you dont know about C key theyre an app that aggregates tickets across the web for all kinds of events then they tell you if its a good deal or a bad deal also well theres a link below to see geek if you put in my name Casey you get 20 bucks off youre your first you had 20 bucks off your first C key ticket purchase but thank you for making this happen links below if you need tickets for anything do it through them because they made this happen this is where it gets fun theres a whole another layer to this story and maybe some of you although I doubt it maybe some of you have picked up on I already made this exact movie I go to Connecticut I surprised Joe in the restaurant that he works in with tickets to the Super Bowl my brother VIN and I did it 11 years ago it was episode 6 episode 7 episode 6 of our HBO series thats that was this was is the exact same premise Applause meet Joe Joe is and has been my best friend since childhood this is Joan me when we were 13 years old those shirts are in cool and this is Joe rollerblading and thats me I think were about 18 here Joe and I had a plan for after high school sorry to interrupt but isnt it crazy how little my vlogging style has changed in 11 years I mean that was like that was like before anybody even used YouTube and I gave it back to this entirely inspired by Jim Carrey and dumb and dumber Joe and I were gonna get a van and moved to Colorado but when we were about 16 these plans set off duh I dropped out of high school ran away from home and had a kid I ended up living in a trailer park in a different town Joe was kind of on his own enjoying his last years in high school partying hanging out with friends doing all that stuff teenagers do I probably havent watched this like six or seven years so Im getting a little nostalgic I wasnt planning on showing so much of the HBO show from a decade ago but it still makes out Im just gonna let this roll Joe still lives in that town in Connecticut he works in the restaurant that I worked in before I left he still lives in that house but now he lives there with his three beautiful children his lovely wife two new cats that he got for Christmas and one dog that absolutely hates me and attacks me every time I step through the door I live a very different lifestyle for my best friend but were both happy thats Joe standing up and hes sitting next to him were watching a Patriots football Music six we had to take Joe to the Super Bowl thats a great story I also I just cant believe how little my filmmaking your vlogging style has changed in 11 years and I was talking to camera is doing all the YouTube tricks this was like the word vlogging didnt even exist let me stick to the story okay Im pulling up to Joes restaurant its Saturday night at 11 oclock This Is It this is the town where he works this is it the restaurant is right here behind me the big surprise now its funny I used to work in this restaurant I used to show up here every day at this restaurant all right lets go see the boy I dont see ya there yes I saw him but he didnt see me thats Joe Im here hes in there he looked really busy Im gonna give it like two seconds and then go back in Music no you want to see him freak out and get all excited for the big surprise but before I show it I want to show you what it was like when I surprised him 11 years ago here we go back in time that envelope contains the tickets and van and I are walking into the restaurant with those currently washing dishes to surprise him Music its incredible life moves fast it feels like your whole world is changing and everything is different every day but when you look at eleven years back to back to you realize we dont change that much okay heres now you remember the last time I walked in here with a camera what are you doing next Sunday Im gonna make it up to Joe I cant let it end on an L buddy nothing makes you happier than seeing the people you care about happy I believe were leaving Friday hes not kidding I remember we went ten years ago 11 years ago and when the Patriots lost I remember be like that was a fun game and I look at Joe and he had just had this like devastated look on his face Applause Music what happened Joe do you remember 10 years ago and Dan and I busted in to give you tickets alas yes we lost so this is this is making up today I hope so so thats the story Im gonna end this little video with an appeal this appeal is for you Tom Brady please dont things up on Sunday I need you to win this game for my friend Joe cuz I dont want to have to remake this movie a third time interesting footnote did you know that Tom Brady and I are basically best friends just kidding we only met once but we did play paper football in his kitchen Music I love that Im so excited that is the joe superbowl story obviously the sisters part one of a two part I gotta show you what happens at the Super Bowl please let them win and I just wanted in this video by saying thank you to everyone for all the support for all the tumult that has been my life over the last week and well I may not know what the big future holds I know what the immediate future holds which is spending as much time as I can with the people that I care about the most Music

Mavic AIR DETAILED REVIEW vs. Mavic Pro,2018-01-23T17:18:35Z,10.0,4687818,120327,Music this is it the brand new DJI Mavic air the latest and greatest from DJI just announced today January 23rd 2018 very excited to test this thing out first lets see whats in the box Music charger controller cables for the controller documentation propeller blades propeller guards oh my gosh holy smokes now this is my first time seeing this thing in person it is tiny its smaller than I could have even imagined this is the DJI spark the smallest drone that they currently sell smaller than the spark this is the previous iteration of the Mavic pro its about half the size now theres a lot more to talk about this thing but I think first lets get in the air and see how it flies here we go this will be the maiden flight of the Mavic air actually you know the most important part of flying a drone is to make sure you respect all local drone laws and youre not allowed to fly in downtown Manhattan so I got a Music the Wall Street heliport please Music Music okay yeah now were in Bermuda this is the pink sand beach perfectly appropriate place to fly this grow much more cinematic than New York Citys Chinatown and the drone laws here are much more forgiving so lets get started now before I fly this thing some quick technical notes first of all this shoots in 4k but my vlogging camera here only shoots in 1080 so this entire video has been uploaded up rezzed up up rezzed so this entire video has been up res to 4k which means youre gonna see this thing at its maximum resolution additionally to give a little context of what the Mavic airs footage looks like Im also gonna be flying DJ eyes other consumer marketed drones including the DJI spark the DJI mavet which all things considered up until now has been my favorite drone and then of course the phantom 4 pro obsidian this thing is a beast it takes my favorite picture but its its huge so today is primarily going to be about the Mavic air now what Im looking for is a nice level place to take the drone off from also because Ill be flying for drones I could really use a hit better beginnin hey we need a spot to take off all right this is it the maiden voyage the first flight ever of the Mavic air ready little fella Wow is that quiet Music Music thats the spark youre looking at now this is the comparison I imagine people are gonna be most interested in these are almost the same size folded up this is a little bit smaller this only shoots in 1080 so its a lower resolution also I dont have the controller for this so Im actually controlling this using just my phone which is a total nightmare my fault I just I forgot that I forgot that main control this footage is from the phantom core pro its unbelievable I cant say enough good things about this drone but its enormous and its very hard to travel with Im just using it here to show you what it looks like if youre willing to deal with something this size all right back to footage Music Music Music Music Music thats incredible incredible our initial review and this will response to the flight everything youd expect from DJI drone performance wise control wise was comparable to the bigger drones obviously I dont know what the picture quality looks like yet but as far as flying it goes its its it feels like a marked improvement over the spark and in line with the Mavic and the phantom 4 alright and that concludes the flight portion of this DJI Matic air review now lets take a closer look at the hardware thatll be easier back in the studio the design of this thing it would be elegant Music this spark feels a little bit like a toy the Mavic Pro definitely feels like a first generation product The Phantom well this thing is just kind of bulky and awkward and another drones on the market well this is just unfortunate little details like the way the landing gear folds down off of the arms the way that the gimbal is sort of built into the body of it it all feels very well thought out and it certainly feels like DJI wanted to make a beautiful product in addition to one that works really well right down to the carrying case I mean this thing is cloth its lovely it feels like it should have a Chanel logo on it so some conclusive thoughts on the Matic air starting with the footage which i think is stellar I think on the Mavic air it crosses that threshold of diminishing return wherein the untrained eye wont be able to tell the difference between the footage coming from this or the footage from a much much bigger more expensive difficult to fly drone there were a couple of minor things about the device that I did not like a lens cover or gimble protector on this thing I couldnt figure how to get it back on it was a pain in the ass I ended up just throwing it out its also a little bit awkward to fold youre never quite sure if youre folding it right it feels like you might be breaking it at times and then lastly to the best of my understanding this operates off of a Wi Fi signal instead of a radio signal most of the time that makes no difference at all but I did notice some range differences between the Wi Fi signal of the Mavic air and the radio signal of the Maverick Pro so that is it for this review of the Mavic air I really think that this is going to be a blockbuster win of a device this is certainly my favorite drone Ive ever used this is going to replace probably all the drones that I use in my canon of hardware to make these videos moving for this will always be in my backpack alongside my camera and lenses and extra batteries if you told me three years ago that in my backpack Id have a flying 4k camera that takes picture quality this good I might not have believed you alright thanks for watching

MY DREAM PRESENT IS HERE!!!!!,2017-12-10T23:17:07Z,8.1,2222115,76963,Christmas no not per Casey nice that so perfect you Casey thats me thank you thank you very much I know whats in this box but to make this scene really climactic and dramatic Im gonna pretend I have no idea whats in this box that might be wrong I didnt know Im pretty sure Im right Im pretty sure I know exactly whats in this box to the ISTEP family seasons greetings from your friends at Emirates Airline oh you guys know where Im going with this one hey thats pretty nice Music I dont want this to come across as ingrateful at all Emirates but this whole premeditated scene would have been much more climactic if my actual plane ticket had been in this package no big deal though in the absence of come on panasonic just focus just but the absence of the ticket I can just explain to you what happened or whats going on like a year ago I flew into Emirates from here to Australia or something like that and they gave me a free upgrade on a ticket that I paid for like I paid for this ticket I mean I didnt pay for it the company that was flying me to anyway this ticket was paid for but they gave me a free upgrade to first class I made a video about sitting in the first class seat which Im sure youve seen sits done 47 48 47 million views cut   a few weeks ago ICM Business Insider that Emirates has this new plane with an even sweeter first class I want to fly in that plane now look there is a good argument that just because I made a video once and just because I harassed them on Twitter Im not entitled to a free airplane ticket I agree I happen to be going back to Dubai for work this week so like all the moons kind of aligned I got in touch they got in touch with me via Twitter and theyre like yeah we can make it happen so I will be flying on that ridiculous new first class cabin very very soon theres another tiny caveat here which is that that plane doesnt actually fly from New York to Dubai so Im gonna go all the way out of our way to go to Brussels on my way to Dubai just so I can fly this new airplane just so I can make a video about it this is very exciting for me Music Music Music yall black suitcases look exactly the same you gotta do something to differentiate excuse this non sequitur but before I embark on my voyage I want to talk about YouTube for a minute the question I had asked more than anything else about YouTube is how do I make a successful YouTube channel there is a very simple a very simple answer to that do something nobody else is doing and do it really well but thats a hard answer to hear because even though thats simple in concept and execution that is maybe the hardest thing there is to do and its for that reason that I appreciate creators like like david dobrik who introduced like an entirely new genre to the the comedy space on youtube or like my friend peter McKinnon who introduced like a different production style to vlogging every once in a while theres a unicorn that is someone I see on YouTube who just like blows my mind a creator doing something that is so new so fresh that like it makes me question my own creativity because its not just a new take on an existing genre its not just doing the same thing other people are doing but better its its completely new from every perspective so this is me talking about my new favorite youtuber her names Ellie the mill as an amber channel but she is someone who I think is pushing the boundaries of YouTube creating content thats just brilliant like really not just complicated but very well done productions but like really intimate and intricate and brilliant narratives and subject matter including like some of our more silly videos that are just sort of like jokes or pranks the complexity and depth with which she approaches even that kind of content is something that there is like not a lot of on this platform now when I try to think of what it is that makes a creator like Elle so special it really begins with the way shes able to authentically be herself on camera I feel like the person I see on screen is the person that I might know in real life thats the kind of thing that seems really really easy there are very very few youtubers who can do that well including me I struggle being on camera the person that the person that I am in real life being yourself well hard is one of the things that you can do on YouTube to really differentiate your content from other peoples people dont always copy your style or your look but they can never copy you being yourself sounds like its an obvious thing to do on the platform but its not and its hard you see other people other creators that are successful you want to emulate them and you end up you end up putting on a facade of who you are end up thank you you end up coming across as disingenuous something youre not so now if you see this video keep up the great work you everyone a collab let me know I just fly up to Canada and hang out with you or maybe you want to come to New York City we could do something interesting together big fan here

Josh what is William Osmond youre gonna have to come here and show me how you have to come here and show me how this thing works thanks Shauna toy mill good luck with your startup really youre Casey youre William Jack McGrath thank you for this teddy bear I dont understand why you had me cut it open and I wish you luck with your YouTube channel thanks for the pillows Paula hope the air nanos ah their headphones expect a comprehensive okay this is what I was looking for all right so like literally two years ago 2015 when I was first trying to fly drones and this vlog and I didnt actually fly drones I would just crash drones in every single episode Ill just crash the drones my sauce video for a drone that was super portable its super easy to fly and all that stuff so I bought it right i pre ordered it and this is snap the worlds first fully portable 4k flying two years later it has shown up this will now be a comprehensive review Music you know the thing that excited me the most was it small compact size at the time the only drone out there was like the Phantom three which is pretty enormous and this seemed tiny but in between the tiers since they announced it and shipped it DJI has really stepped up their game this thing doesnt seem so small anymore but uh lets fly it Im headed to a safe place to fly the drone in Brooklyn away from any potential dangers because Im a responsible non commercial amateur drone just fa please dont give me a hard time about this Im just trying out a new toy Music were out here in Brooklyn now a nice safe place to fly and this is kind of the biggest selling point its how easy its supposed to fit into a backpack your body the camera right there battery and then Im assuming its called the snap because all right ready look it folds out and then this white module which is where the camera is and whatnot this kind of snaps in snaps battery snaps on whoa its not bad right I was like what the hell are you gonna do with all those parts no thats it like no screws nothing and then it automatically turns on I think I couldnt find the power button but it made a noise then you trying to put it down theres no skis no feet you just like put it down there right on the battery hi nice nice to meet you a lot of friendly people here in Brooklyn she was shes doing pretty much shes struggling pre med premed now it does have an Android in an iPhone app but I was recommended to use the iPhone app because the Android app is still in beta so theres no controller no controller okay GPS connected lets fly no way yeah but Im not getting an image oh here we go Music watch that fence watch that bad Jesus how does it feel its not holding its position very well its a little drifting but it looks like it just caught GPS see its staying in one spot right now okay its way out over the water do you see it its accelerometer based yeah are you even controlling her right now there it goes do you feel like you have any control are you trying to bring it back I still cant quite have it going up higher I dont know how to make it cutter a home but Im trying to fly it will nothing happen side way yeah Im Im really struggling with the controls here and Im doing everything its said to do there it is Wow Music it landed you caught it I didnt feel like I had a whole lot of control but in in this things defense the first time I flew a spark with the phone the first time I used a parrot the parrot one which requires the phone basically any drone Ive ever used where the control is limited to the phone Ive never had any control youre trying to touch class and use an accelerometer and its just a its just this guy right here who we do not know is flying a Mavic the Mavic is probably the the biggest competitor to this to the snap the snaps 899 the Mavic is roughly the same price I think its 999 with the controller the Mavic is in my opinion one of the greatest drones ever made so today Im talking me through details here talking to putting your songs on a glass screen to control a thing like this is not good you want tactile buttons you want to feel what youre youre doing and this is just like the accelerometer control is very responsive if I will say and that actually works and then its got a gimbal too which is pretty impressive stabilized gimbal but well have to see how that video looks it didnt look very promising from the feet on the phone now well go check out what the footage looks like Music all right so I gotta say that the footage looks fantastic I think the footage is amazing the stabilization is buttery smooth the image is at least as good as the Mavic but when it comes to drone cinematography the image quality is secondary on the list of importance after cinematography if you cant get like the perfect dynamic shots that you want what does it matter if its a little bit smoother or the colors a little bit more rich my problem with this drone is the same problem that I had with the DJI spark before I had the controller you just cannot control a drone which is there are six axes plus the axis of the camera using a touchscreen phone but in conclusion my review of the snap drone is that its a very very interesting device but the control and competence you have over the actual device is extremely limited now YouTube audience I dont ask you for much besides buy my new merch I do need your help to help me commit make I need your help with the Christmas miracle okay my friend Sams 2017 goal was to get to a hundred thousand subscribers he helps me with all my videos hes a really good guy

IS THIS THE CAMERA OF THE FUTURE?,2017-11-29T17:59:50Z,6.233333333333333,2745180,72036,Music so I get emails companies reach out to me I get contacted all the time people wanted me to review or talk about their new products I almost always say no so this company called Rilo contacted me about their new 360 camera I was super skeptical its a 360 camera and I already have this 360 camera this 360 cam this 360 camera and I even I even bought like this 3d printed GoPro 360 camera Wow well I do think 360 is important I just dont so thats why I wasnt super interested in this camera but then they sent me this video as to how it works Music so what that was is using a 360 image the same kind of 360 image that one of these would give you and basically its like pick whatever camera angle you want pick it in post production and they also made software that enables that Music but it grows your hug so again Im just holding this Im just holding this thing still and like that spinner on so you could see that guy I did that in your app app I recorded this now whats particularly compelling here is not so much the hardware the hardwares its nice its sturdy it feels well built but its the software heres how I was doing all of those shot again unfortunate they dont have Android software but heres what it looks like on my iPhone alright so thats the image thats the image as it was shot there but then in their software you can navigate what the camera is pointing at so there I am yapping at the camera just kind of tap to pause on that ready then hold on my face like this okay now look Im locked on my face I can tell it to or follow this face so if I do follow this now no matter what my head is what stays level on the shot Music so that entire skateboard ride I just had this thing out its charging had this out in front of me like this I wasnt spinning it I was doing I was just holding it in front of me oh youre here or we gonna go do something so fun Franny yeah yeah did you take a nap you did sleep my man how you doing cool baby everything good everythings great how you been Im good Im good happy holiday happy holiday Claire to see you in two come with us Music traffic so the question is is there real market for this camera and its technology or is this just another cool gimmick that people will get sick of quickly and and the answer and I dont know the answer see tomorrow is the Macys Day Parade and they fly all these floats down the street and this is where they fill them up with helium the night before see the big helium tank right there Music so at 500 who is the Rilo camera actually for made a chart I see the whole camera market as bifurcated into two groups and this is an oversimplification but I think it does sort of illustrate the point anyone from an aspirational creator all the way to professionals are in one category the other category I just call casual as heres some concern for this product if youre in the first category that is the aspirational its a professional category or around the same 500 you could get an entry level SLR camera like this thing or you get a high quality point and shoot like this so if Im an aspirational creator I dont know that Id be spending the 500 on this because its not quite as dynamic as a traditional camera and then on the other side of that spectrum youve got professional users and if youre a pro youre not going to use a consumer marketed product like this youre going to use maybe one of the fancier GoPro rigs or something like that so I dont think this fits in to this category so does it fit into the sort of casual as and my feeling on that is also a no because casual as creators they just use their phone so thats it thats for thats it for my my Rilo experiment seems like a very cool device had was good yeah and for what its worth I really appreciate that this is a startup company meaning a student coming from like a huge corporation or anything in fact when they sent me this device they sent me this little video Chris from Rilo Im definitely rooting for you and your company I hope this thing finds success do I see a place for this in my own repertoire of filmmaking tools I dont know all right that concludes another case united side tech review I think maybe cuz its Christmas or something but people are sending me an insane amount of gear theres like five new electric skateboards over there I dont even know its in these gigantic boxes over here expect a lot more reviews coming from this channel soon,139.7326203208556,oversimplification,0.0,1.0,nMbUA7dghlk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMbUA7dghlk

FRIEND or COMPETITION?,2017-11-24T16:00:01Z,8.166666666666666,1301799,44989,Music so whats happening here I happen to be in Toronto for work engagement I got back from Amsterdam where Pierre was with me in Amsterdam like yesterday we both posted fun videos this morning of us hanging out Amsterdam now everybody has all these questions everybody wants more and more more its like here do you have like an hour cuz Ive got a lunch break for my work thing and were making movies but this isnt this isnt your house no this is my house I wish it was my house were gonna be allowed to use it uh huh were gonna break into it the best ever there in Japan right now and theyre like yeah talk to the guy at the front desk and maybe you make it happen Music yes and no make your apartments there its 1257 now I feed back my cheese thats doable right planning space plenty of space doing fine I know the face youre giving the camera Peter you are a much much much better cinematographer than you are plenty of room planning room you got it Lanny roof and were good thank you thank you look at that Park job okay thank you Wow look at that you imma cannon slide in here is there any light on my face I dont know those I like that frame you could see the tower behind us theyre great let me just cheat yourself I got a little close with this things all wobbly so largely because we only have a short amount of time but also because Peters such an aficionado when it comes to cinematography and camera gear and and all those things I thought it might be an appropriate QA ready Im ready Butch Hartman question we want to do a collab with me yes I do but Hartman thats the guy that drew Fairly OddParents you know this guy I know this guy Music right yeah were gonna do a hundo peak lab what are mistakes you see people making with storytelling I think a misconception of storytelling is that you need like a hero and a villain and it has to be like a classical like you know a plot whereas a story can just be something very basic from moving from point A to point B doesnt to be so literal thats right thats right its my thinking that best Airport youve been to probably Hong Kong or I like to Amsterdam oh oh no no Doha it has a swimming pool in it oh hands down winner Music so Dan asks when shooting a vlog are all of your shots done in sequence or do you film a talking ahead segment then go back and b roll and my answer to that is I dont always shoot in sequence no in fact the video that I made yesterday of us in the Amsterdam so the anchor that videos me interviewing you we shot that the next day and then I used that as like a narrative bed for the rest of the episode yeah theres tons of times where I actually film a vlog over like three days time and I wear the same clothes and then just cut it in to make it feel like it was all done the same day Rick wants to know when do you guys get married were not I think theyre getting the wrong I dont understand that we like to collaborate in the videos weve made one video interesting how do you feel the people looking at you as a crazy person when youre talking into a camera I find it very hard if youre worried that much about what people think of you you probably should not try to be a youtuber I mean theres always something a little weird about it oh its weird you just gotta oh yeah oh yeah try vlogging with a GoPro on your head thats the most weird its ever been for me what color profile do you use Casey no answer I have no idea yeah okay I shoot flat so if I had a log color profile on my cameras I would use that but I shoot everything flat so that it color grades better in post hes good when you sit down out of the vlog do you have an entire idea of how you want the entire thing to play out or do you dive in headfirst and see what you can create I almost always know before I start to edit what Im doing but I assemble it and I really tighten up the story in the Edit I need to be better at that because I a lot of the time just like fly by the seat of my pants Im starting to edit and Im like oh I like where this is going and then I have some ideas but that is not my preferred method of creating I would much rather have it planned we gotta go lets go we gotta go this is the QA is not over we got to go to the whose apartment is this melissa alejandro dear Melissa I dont think Jim listen Alejandra thank you for letting us use your apartment it was a great Music you got this all right right back right right back keep it straight you got it straight youre good plenty of distance 75 feet six suck it up funny his face cut the wheel straighten her out cut the wheel the other way straighten her out turn the wheel you know that scene and Austin Powers as a youtuber how do you create original content when it seems like everything has already been done yeah Ill hit that one off you have to tell your story if Ive told all of my stories and piers told all of his stories which neither of us have it doesnt change the fact that nobody knows your story so the written language has been around since hieroglyphics thousands of years there are still new stories being told every single day not everythings been done its up to you to find your own voice on YouTube and nobody can do that better than you that was good that was like I was I feel like I was being kind of aggressive there and then you were kind of like the super nice just want to bring it home you know Im headed back to my event now great question here do you see Peter as a competitor or as a friend no as a friend but I said anything about all youtubers anyone who works in the space is big as YouTube and thinks that somebody elses success is gonna slow them down is sorely mistaken YouTube is not at all a zero sum game it is the more people who can succeed on this platform the more we will all succeed on this platform like simply put the Internet is big enough for everyone yeah are you coming to the event with me Im just gonna walk in I dont have a pass for you I used to be a magician Music great a great day Canada dude good to see you thank you taking me up thanks for all of your questions and

Peter Mckinnon teaches me to VLog (in AMSTERDAM),2017-11-21T12:59:39Z,11.283333333333333,1724010,61854,Music what are you getting for breakfast Oh probably the French house in Amsterdam with uh Peter MacKinnon here guys great dancer check this out from vlogs Pass see this bridge right here right here thats where I proposed to Candice so many years ago Oh Candice was actually supposed to be with me today instead I brought ah then I brought Peter so if you dont know Peter Peter is a fantastic youtuber hes a much better youtuber than me were gonna spend the day where Peter teaches me how to make better vlogs thanks Peter no problem man Music were in like the Courtyard hotel and they were like oh my god there were some people following us I think were smiling though Peter what did you do before YouTube like why are you why are you why is your skill set with the camera so so next level the last job I had I spent seven years filming magicians around the world so Ive had kind of the expertise the working expertise for seven straight years filming everywhere and then why why take your I take your skill set and your huge ass camera to YouTube I just I wanted a platform where I could share myself without limits and without anybody telling how I could do it so I figured that was just the best way and the best platform for it Music many years ago do you have any place to recommend to the right thank you Music down totally down youre like Im really happy twelve year old Peter Ive rode a bike and like had like the longest time and Im pumped how am i doing the vlog by the way I think youre doing great so if everything looks good so far the cinematic sound when I read some bikes I do how do I make your globe float oh wait I can I got it I got it I got it Oh what you think renting bikes is a its a good idea absolutely so were gonna were gonna start here come down here over here through here up here which Ill get into this bond Oh excellent penmanship winds how long did it take you to get to your first million subscribers well I guess wait for it wait for it it took nine months come on thats insane all right thank you sir Music Music you look good back there Peter they take their bike rules here really seriously so you got to stay on the correct side of the road you gotta obey traffic laws how is it you can vlog it theres a child coming at you how can you blog and ride anything Id love to know that ready going through the tunnel my thesis on vlogging is that I try to do the best production quality I can but the story comes first so I never let my camera get in the way of the story thats why I dont carry a monster like this is because I dont feel like I could be spontaneous with such a beast yeah this definitely this definitely its a beast you get used to it but this is turned into like a romantic honeymoon Music its his first time in Amsterdam its amazing here but we spending a lot of time in this kind of threshold to this parking garage because were just getting so soaking wet its cinematic though its cinematic lets throw in a little bit of mckinnon slow motion ready Music its that kind of weather today where you cant be waxed its just cold enough work youre wet and cold youll get pneumonia were just gonna wait for the rain to stop why is your lighting in your studio so good yeah I never used to die never used to put the work in the lighting always used the window and I was like wouldnt a light forever and then a friend of mine was like no buy a light so I bought a light diffused it set it up nice with a boom mic and everything and then suddenly if production values went through the riot in the studio and I turned my light out it looks like theres like a flashlight do you need to defuse light you can use a shower curtain youve got IKEA and buy a shower curtain just throw something in front of that light so its softer then itll look like just money Oh real quick we were having a lovely day on our bicycles and enjoying all that Amsterdam has back at the hotel Peter actually is staying in a separate hotel but then I checked in here and this hotel is huge so hes gonna sleep on that our couch and then Im gonna sleep in the bedroom which is just down the hall so I said last week we remember I posted the video about Chantal that I wanted to put more energy into using my channel to talk about creators that I really liked and whose work I really liked so even though were having fun and just out here sort of Peters channel if you havent seen it Peters channel is the channel that I think like he brings a level of production quality to his work in his YouTube videos that theres not a lot of on this platform and I say kind of in jest that hes helping teach me how to vlog but I mean it like he is a hes a total practitioner when it comes to the act of photography and cinematography how do this is his vlogging camera its not even a joke Peters not hes no small youtuber Peters a very big youtuber hes very successful on the platform but if by chance you dont know of him or dont know of his work should definitely check it out its below and he has like despite all the funny stuff he has genuinely like showed me a few of his tricks and how he achieves like the crazy production quality that his stuff has its now heavy this is you could do it well you hold it by one of course better oh come on alright Im try should we go return the bikes now yeah lets go take it back do you remember were ready bikes home I think we go I think we go around but we have to hurry because the place is gonna close and then were stuck with the bikes I miss the fall okay this is the coolest passport Ive ever seen what what are these this is like yellow pages dude this is good what is that thank you Thanks so looking ahead what do you what do you hope to accomplish on YouTube whats the whats the master plan Peter I think master plan I just continue what Im doing its like the first time in my life Ive been able to actually like work for myself and just have fun and like no limits so like maintaining that until the next thing grips me and I want to go after that 110 percent

WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE,2017-11-13T17:13:01Z,11.3,2980503,102717,Music Kenneth and I are headed to our therapy our couples therapy session right now and I had an idea that I wanted to talk to you about and get your opinion on were thinking about doing a podcast a Casey and Candice podcast thats like I dont know like an hour long or a half an hour long or something and calling it the title of the best part calling it therapy where its just us talking there probably is but we can just make ours bigger and better and then crush the competition so let us know you think like thats a terrible idea just write terrible idea below if youd be interested at all well the only thing is Im tired of hearing the comments that Im such a like bitching a dud I think people Music were at therapy now but thats the idea let us let us know what you think we finished therapy how do you think today went today in therapy we talked about having more children and whether or not we want to move to California we should do the podcast the laws Music who are you taking your clothes off nice box because Joe to Billy love Billy NYC calm and by Candices new cashmere sweater its a little expensive for my audience honey 180 for pure cashmere bye honey great girl great girl check this out ready I want to I want to show this to you so get it got a screw here got a string here and on the other end theres like this pin that can be used to remove SIM cards I have permanently attached this to my desk now this may seem like a nothing but you know I change cell phones all the time and getting that little SIM tray out as a nightmare on my phone here oh and I want to get my memory card out to offload all the videos and stuff its hard to get out and I can never find this thing and now look it just lives here this is exciting for me Applause Im gonna be premiering a new video that I made that Ive been working on for a long time Im gonna like put it in this vlog its like a four minute video to be part of this vlog you see one thing I want to do a lot more of on this channel is talk about creators other critters that I really like that I think you should follow that I think maybe youll be interested in and the video that I made is about my friend Chantal who youve seen in this show before and she just started youtubing so I want to premiere her new movie on my channel even though its gonna live on her channel I want to use in this channel and I want to use like this big audience that that this channel has to talk about smaller creators shes brand new she doesnt have any subscribers and to talk about other people that I think are doing amazing things in this platform and try to sort of elevate them a little bit shine a little spotlight on them so this is uh this is my friend Chantal Chantal is a fine artist do you go by that visual this all this find all this and the reason why I like Chantal so much as an art the reason why I like her as a person thats cuz shes cool the reason why I like her as an artist is because her only instrument her only actually have her entire art career was built with a pan just a pen look this is this is my apartment and then this is I have one of chantels paintings in my apartment thats Francine in my apartment a couple years ago had a studio here but we were friends before that yeah she had one of the best studios she had one of the studios in this feeling that has skylight you almost took it I was gonna take it its just like four flights away I dont want to go up all those stairs Ive always wanted to make a movie about Chantal and her artwork and who she is because shes such an interesting human being and we were kind of given the excuse actually from Sam are you gonna stick with that   oh yeah this is one of Chantell stickers we were given the opportunity because of Samsung you know part of their like creator creator initiative is enabling us to make movies and they were willing to sort of produce a case you nice that movie about Chantal Martin and Im gonna premiere that movie Im wondering where I should drop it let me finish lets finish okay lets finish an and itll play cool Im reviving my old youtube channel that I started probably 10 11 12 years ago right at the beginning and I forgot I had it actually one thing that I will say about Chantal is she is fearless about trying new things its like I see everything is a blank canvas so you shouldnt be afraid of it you should flip that switch and then just use it as a challenge and create whatever you want how did you meet Kendrick Lamar still in Miami last year how did you meet Puff Daddy he came to the show I had a few years ago he probably doesnt remember okay so without further ado Im good this is the world YouTube premiere of a Chantel by KC video its like three minutes long but Im really excited youre the first people to see this ever ready 3 2 1 so whats the point in making our the point is to make so you can share so you may concern your making sure you make your share Im Chantal Martin and I draw Im drawing on canvases Im drawing on walls Im going on cars and drawing on shirts and drawing on shoes 99 of that is done live when youre drawing live you have no time to think you have no time to hesitate you have no time to plan you have no time to be anyone else so this is the cover of the home and garden section and its its funny I didnt know it was a big deal at the time so I only bought one copy so you have an extra spare copy out there I take it I remember my art teacher telling me Chantal dont apply for art school because youre not good enough and you wont get in at that point people were only telling me what I couldnt do so I ran away I started my career in Japan in a culture that was craft based in a culture where people learn things and practice things over generations over long periods of time and I remember thinking to myself what can I master in my lifetime what could I become a family confident with what about a lie you know I draw I love drawing we all drop though with these these Im gonna draw like this what kind of hard work and patience would it take so that when I draw a line is recognizably mine moving to york was very humbling because if no one knows who you are they dont care who you are and everyone is an artist and you start to lose your you start to lose your way and so I decided well Im not gonna not make up because you wont show it Im gonna draw maybe the well my canvas and Im gonna lose any drawing tool that I can get my hand Im gonna draw and villager on just give me a pen and Ill make something Applause we follow the pen and were allowed to allow it to go wherever it needs to go wherever it wants to take you you are a William passenger Music and now you repeat that and you repeat that and you repeat that you repeat that but over time you get to extract what you look like over time you get to extract what your line feels like something that is recognizably yours we have this contact between our head and our pan it doesnt matter what industry youre in it comes down to drawing it comes down to that initial mark that you make and without this pen I wouldnt have traveled I wouldnt have collaborated this tool has allowed me to discover who I am Music did you like our movie were good we worked really hard on that I hope you enjoyed it what are you most nervous about when it comes to being a youtuber I think what Im most nervous about is continuously making and sharing and pulling out stuff that Im proud of and putting out stuff that youre proud of to you make in your share and you make you gotta making sure making sure making sure making sure all right Im gonna link Chantal shadow before below check it out shes new theres not a lot of stuff up there yet but its happening Im a big supporter and a huge huge fan and I hope you guys will but you should sell those stickers you could bank all your entire you sticker packs coming

FEEELINGS ABOUT THE IPHONE X,2017-11-10T16:43:22Z,8.816666666666666,4791186,128185,Music Ive been getting a ton of requests to talk about the new iPhone 10 the iPhone X so I thought Id make a quick video sharing with you some of what I like and some of what I dont like about this phone if you dont feel like watching the whole video long story short I really like this thing I Im more of an Android guy than I am an iPhone guy but Ive always carried an iPhone and an Android phone ten years ago I slept on the street to be the first person to get the iPhone one when it came out but then a few months later I was also the first person to get the HTC g1 which was the first ever Android phone to come out so Im just kind of a phone nerd my main phone is a Samsung Note 8 I also work for Samsung so take that for what its worth and I do want to talk about this just a draw contrast with different features on the iPhone 8 okay chapter one form factor Music this is a 6 or 7 this is the 5s this is a 6 they have this kind of these but theres something about the glass and metal sandwich here and the weight of this it feels feels really good in the hand now on the back of this glass sandwich there is this gigantic camera protrusion and its hard to say without holding it just how significant it is previous iPhone designs have this kind of swoop or this little metal ring here on the galaxy its perfectly flush but on this they chose to make it this big fat like you could you could like shave with this thing it doesnt feel like theyre trying to hide it its like theyre owning the fact that this things got a protrusion if you cant make it perfectly beautiful and flush like it is on the galaxy or on the old iPhones the next best thing is just to own it it feels very industrial now they call this thing a tall screen and it sort of is besides the I like that theres no more button down here but I will say I was out shooting the other day trying to use this with my drone and the whole phone crashed and because there was no physical home button the DJI app crashed and theres no way for me to crash this app to get back to the home screen because theres no home screen button so nothing I do can get it can lock the phone and then unlock the phone and face ID it open okay and then were back here now if this were the old iPhone I could just DoubleTap but no Im completely stuck the only other hardware thing to talk about is the the lack of a bad phone jack now thats been gone for a couple of years so I I cant really    about it anymore but it still sucks it sucks as much now as it did before I really like your headphone jack and I know the new pixel doesnt have a headphone jack Samsung please please dont take away the headphone jack face ID the killer out I think everybodys been talking about its good its way better than I expected when it works its like its not even locked it just magically opens when it works because I wear sunglasses 21 hours a day it doesnt work when I try it with sunglasses on it just doesnt so it gives me sort of two options I can go like this I gotta wait for it to fail and then I just punch in my key code circa 2011 its fine I do wish there was a redundant measure there on my main phone on my note it has a retinal scanner which works similarly I use the retinal scanner if Ive got glasses off Ive got glasses on I just put a finger down there and it unlocks I would love another mechanism to unlock this thing besides face ID and besides this key code and to get really specific it does this thing where it tries to unlock with face ID and theres about a two second wait before the keypad comes up so that means two seconds of waiting before I can actually punch in my code and unlock it that sounds like a small deal but I mean you know I locked my phone like 500 times a day gets a little annoying other things that I really liked that I didnt think I would like the gesture input on this that is the the closing of apps by swiping up and and pulling down on the corner to bring up your control panel and pulling down over here to bring up notifications it feels like a much more human interaction than maybe like tapping these virtual buttons and it works in a way that after you know 36 hours became really intuitive when gripe I have with the swiping interaction it said to bring up the multitasking to bring up all the the windowpanes like this its a little awkward you have to you have to swipe up and then hold your finger there for them to appear and then if you wanted to shut down all these apps at once you have to kind of pull down and wait for this thing to come up its fine were talking about seconds of lag here but the way it worked on the the way it works on Android where you tap a button and you can swipe through to me feels like it feels more efficient this feels like Im holding and waiting anything you can do I can do better I could do anything better than you know I could make like a 2 hour long video about Android versus iOS I dont want to go too far down that bottomless hole pit right now but there are a couple things that really stand out here for starters the notifications if you think you know your phone as a communication device understanding all these communications that are coming in across all these different apps be able to organize those and process those in your head is maybe the most important part the most important part of your relationship with your phone now Android which has a lot of faults dont get me wrong theres a lot of that Android doesnt I just dont understand androids notification system I think is near perfect everythings right there its neatly organized the most common interaction I do with my Android devices is just pull down from the top and I can literally see everything thats going on now on iOS and this is less than iPhone 10 things it is an iOS thing like 60 of all these notifications are just are just for my American Express card telling me that I had charges why not group them all together why do I have to have 500 notifications from the same app in the end I have almost all of my notifications turned off on this thing because this notification display menu thing its just such a dumpster fire and its always been that way ever since iOS you pulled out from the top its always been this big fat confusing mess another thing that I would love to see on these devices Apple did a really good job of doing multi window that is like having more than one app open on a single screen on the iPad and the iPad pro its great theres a lot of real estate here how about letting me have two apps open at once thats something that I use all the time on my on my note youre driving in your car get your maps open but you also want to watch the latest h3h3 drop you can have them both open here Apple why not do that to your plenti real estate look at the size of that big juicy screen love to see multi window that really does impact the productivity of the mobile device and the last thing to touch on is the knotch when I was doing a little bit of research for this video I read a bunch of online reviews a lot of people said that a lot of people said that the not just kind of goes away like you get used to it I disagree the knotch never stops being annoying its like this omnipresent thing that I looked out of this beautiful display and it feels honestly it feels like its a mistake like it shouldnt be there but they got nowhere else for it to go it the first thing I did when I got this phone is I changed out my background screen from that like beachy thing to all black now if you look the notch is gone and on either side is like your reception status and the time it looks great it looks like how it should be I kind of wish that was implemented across the board like in every app that kept it nice and black up there to hide the not just hide it with software all right so theres a kind of my initial thoughts uh and conclusion here will the iPhone X replace my note 8 as my main phone no you know Ive always liked this is a so many Android phone here and this is an HTC Android phone Ive always found Android to be a better productivity device the no date with the stylus the bigger screen its just a better computer in my pocket I didnt talk about I didnt talk about cameras or video cameras are the things that I imagine my audience really cares about I want to do a really exhaustive side by side camera test like where you can see the iPhone 10 again the note 8 Im gonna do that but I didnt want to like half ass that by putting it in this video so Ill make that video later ok thats it I hope you like my I hope

NYC Terror Attack happened in front of my Apartment,2017-11-02T19:30:01Z,11.033333333333333,2882530,127809,so there was a terrorist attack in New York City about three blocks from my apartment the whole situation left me a little bit shook so I thought Id make so I thought to make a youtube video just kind of share like what my day look like and I filmed some of in any event heres what happened first that the location where the whole thing took place is literally like its right where I live additionally it was on Halloween and the morning of Halloween Francine had her her preschool party so Ken and I were at the preschool with her it was a half day so we had taken her home and left her with the babysitter that morning so shed normally be in school when the when the attack occurred but she was home I was sitting in the office and I got a phone call from one of the guys I work with at CNN it was just like hey we just got a report of some sort of attack in your neighborhood check on your family and I like I called the babysitter she didnt answer I totally freaked out and raced home turns out that the baby was asleep shes like vacuuming or something and she didnt hear the phone familys fine everythings fine but let me get into this some of the details of the day first of all it was Halloween Halloween is like one of my favorite days in New York City its one of those days where the whole city kind of gets excited around the same thing and that thing is like grown men and women dressing up in goofy outfits Halloween is my favorite holiday its a wonderful day so much so that I even like started shooting a vlog that was going to be my Halloween vlog and let me show you I think I maybe I probably shot a minute or so but this would have been the vlog for the day Music Halloween Halloween is one of the greatest days to be in New York City for whatever reason New Yorkers take the holiday very very seriously I like your glasses the werewolf happy Halloween are you cold skeleton so after that shot I like sat down and started doing emails and then I got the phone call called the babysitter she didnt answer or freaked out ran down there I have another camera on me and I recorded sort of what I saw Applause Music now this part bothered me a little bit and I say this carefully because NYPD a huge fan of the NYPD absolute heroes extra love to officer Ryan Nash who is the the cop who actually took down the bad guy thank you but in this moment right here I was like panicking and they had the road blocked and I went to go around the corner and an officer stopped me and I said to him Im going to check out my family and he said to me and this stuck with me if so I cant really I dont really understand he said to me your familys fine no one was injured but the perp purpose and perpetrator the bad guy she was like 50 feet from where the incident took place at more than I dont want to dwell on it I would give that officer the benefit of the doubt maybe he was misinformed but at that moment I took him at his word and I just when he said nobody was hurt okay so Im standing right there and Im smoking circle Im just getting ready to go into class and all you hear is like four to five gunshots here thats rapid eye and Im trying to figure out because everybody starts running and Im trying to think to myself like maybe its not you know like everybodys overreacting but then you see like a cops like undercover cops running this way then you see all the cops going that way and it only took like five seconds and there was a guy who actually got the video and I think he was trying to talk to the news snap poet and there was a nice can you shoot him he was sitting right there it was a hole it was a guy in the Home Depot truck he crashes the two people in the bike lane apparently and then he got out the cop said no it was her well thats not it thats not what I heard from them you could talk to somebody over there thats not what I heard from that but apparently and he got the video of the guy with the guns in his hand apparently there were two guns Music the other side get Im adding it lets go go on the street terrible situation eight people killed 12 people injured just a absolutely horrific progressive where it happened where in the world but the fact that it was so close to home on that that bike path is where like every one of these vlog starts its like me and my skateboard going up that bike path every run time I run in the vlog Im running on that bike path every day seven days a week Francine and her stroller up that path seven days a week thats where we live it was very this one was particularly scary for me check down the baby everythings fine babys fine babysitters fine Im going back to the office what a scary situation my god go back to the office get my stuff and then go back home but you know I    love New York City and I love New York City in a way that is like indescribable to people who dont also love New York City I have like Im obsessed with this town this town is the main character in every video that I make and one of the one of the main reasons is like a few hours after this attack took place the city proceeded with the Halloween parade where there was like I have no idea thousands tens of thousands of people and spectators and people in costumes and parade floats and all that stuff Josh is out celebrating just to celebrate and tell us about the citys decision to allow the Greenwich Village Halloween parade to go forward tonight whats it like like when the city has to make a decision like that well look III dont envy the mayor the governor for having to make that tough of the decision but I got to tell you I didnt for one second think we were canceling the parade nor did I think the mayor the governor really thought that for one second if you cancel the parade when something like this happens youve sent a message to the terrorists that weve surrendered that weve let go of our way of life and they control it were never gonna do that in New York never the denizens of New York City were like hey terrorists    you I want to have a great night and enjoy this city and enjoy the people of this city and you and your cowardly attack on innocent people will not hinder that and thats why I love New York City I was asked that day like does this make you think about leaving the city does this make you want to leave the city somewhere where this might have not have happened and my answer is abso fucking lutely not I moved to this city you know three months before the September 11th terrorist attack I lived a half a block beneath the World Trade Centers when they found was knocked off of my bicycle trying to pedal away from the World Trade Centers as the second plane hit the debris it was I was there like my where I lived was destroyed I was in this city in 2003 when there was the blackout I was here in 2012 when half the city was under water from Hurricane sandy I was here when Sully land a plane in the the East River I will I will leave this city and I will take my family with me at some point in time but it sure as    wont be because some some    coward terrorists on a mission to harm innocent people you know committed just a horrific atrocity here thats not why I would leave that    doesnt intimidate me his actions dont intimidate me people like him dont intimidate me or change the way I feel about this city at all so whenever theres a whenever something like this happens whether its the events in Las Vegas several weeks ago or Boston a few years ago you know people say Boston strong or Vegas strong or New York City strong and I think that means different things but when I here in New York City strong I think of that kind of resilience because I in order at the office today I went literally directly past where the where the attack took place and I saw scores of women pushing their children in strollers I literally saw one NYPD police officer bending down like this giving like candy to a little kid in the stroller and giving high fives this is my home and this is my home because of that because of that resilience and that warmth and the amazing community that the 20 million people that live here are and Im not going to let and I would never let I would never let something like that change how I feel about a place like no    way okay thats it I just wanted to share that with you yeah I mean Im still a little bit like wow guys what a total absolute coward again Bravo the NYPD for taking care of business and stopping it and of course absolute condolences to those who often lost their lives and were injured in the families of those people okay Ill probably go back to posting a normal video tomorrow but I wanted to share those thoughts of you,155.98187311178248,indescribable,1.0,1.0,wR7QKyQ33q8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR7QKyQ33q8

$200 MICRO BOOSTED BOARD,2017-10-24T19:17:01Z,8.2,4581603,94340,all right so despite the increase in the cloud cover over the past couple of hours temperatures have remained on the warm side still in the lower 70s we had a few more than that up to 76 October 23rd 2017 and its 76 degrees outside average weather for this the average temperature for October 23rd is 50 degrees it is 26 degrees above normal today I need an excuse to be outside for todays video Music all these packages right here these are mail time packages no I I genuinely thought when I announced I should be selling my extra mail time stuff that people would stop sending me mail time stuff but more just keeps coming if you dont know what Im talking about a few months ago I said I was gonna take all the mail time stuff that I dont personally use and sell it on eBay so far weve been able to sell almost 35 thousand dollars worth of stuff and all that money is gonna go help the people affected by the hurricane who live in Puerto Rico were distributing it with a couple of different nonprofits down there but good work folks one thing that came in that really stood out that Ive wanted to make a video about is this tiny electronic skateboard called quick wheel I think its called quick wheel now if youve ever seen this channel before or any of my videos you know that I am the worlds biggest boosted board fan I own six of these things I ride it literally every day of my entire life and this electric skateboard the boosted board has literally changed the way I interact with this entire city I dont ride a bike I dont take the subway the only way I really get around is on this thing I love the boosted board its the greatest thing ever but I have one gigantic persistent complained about the boosted board and that is the price it is cost prohibitive for most people so theres gonna like me how tiny this thing is its also only 200 bucks which matter of disclosure I wasnt hired Im not being paid by quick wheel to review this thing initial sort of build quality on this it feels like like a regular proper skateboard see this is like its what a regular board decks made out of wheels feel nice and gummy bearings I dont know they seem fine it looks like the motor is housed inside of the wheel here and I think theres just one motor just in this wheel all right now for the real world test I recruited my friend Sam helmet runner kids and riding electric skateboard of any kind safety matters so were gonna go to the west side where its like a safe place to test these things what is interesting though is my abilities to carry this skateboard while riding my big skateboard Music so just to show off the sides before we actually test this this is your regular penny board here look it its smaller than a regular sized penny board this is your regular sized backpack almost sort of fits right in the back it spins ready silent Music Music its much harder to balance on the Naboo support you look so goofy right its like a toy I mean I have to say the responsiveness is pretty good like the speed top that do not have the confidence on this that you do on a boost at work already this is the breakdown 3 2 1 break theres not much for breaks alright dude do I have to Music Music you look crazy Music so I guess the question is is this a toy or is this like an actual means of transportation its its a toy I think this is a toy but airports airports travel what else does this useful for if you have a huge house a good way to get around your home yeah I mean at 200 bucks its not a bad Toyota play with like I dont have many bad things to say about this its really small and as someone whos been skateboarding for a while theres really not much room to put your feet so one thing that is interesting its both the size and the Flex of the boosted board that lets you come over bumps and if you hit little potholes or cracks it can handle it so this board hasnt either size nor flex so when you hit a bump you really feel it mostly take off that much all right so epic conclusion here its a cool device I think theyre only 200 bucks which is a great price but I dont think they feel safe the way that a boosted board does I think boosteds the only electric skateboard Ive ever ridden that actually feels safe to ride if youre a parent that you get it for your kids then you live on a cul de sac and its a flat ground yeah maybe maybe a fun toy if youre thinking about this for any form of viable transportation even if you live on a college campus I give it a no the same its its dangerous its dangerous but it is fun and 200 bucks is an insane price Music Applause Music Applause Music the only electric skateboard that weighs less than three kilograms you know one day I do have a quick question about when it comes to this skateboard on their IndieGoGo page it looks like like a crowdsource thing the company quick wheel it says in San Francisco but the voiceovers like this weird the board is made of computerized voice and then theres like two very American looking bros who star in the video but its filmed in China I have nothing against products made in China just if its a Chinese company own that its a Chinese company and dont front like its a San Francisco startup this is a robot word why does it seem like theyre posing as a Bay Area so look thats China yeah yeah thats bizarre weird

WE FINISHED THE MOVIE!!,2017-10-21T13:23:05Z,9.683333333333334,1407937,48922,like earlier this year maybe this summer browsing Marfa Texas Music and house there is my friend max were trying to like plan this movie that he was trying to make what were doing out here today is were doing more location scouting for Maxs movie all right well today were like proper production of that movie were shooting part of it here in New York City so todays episode will primarily be a BTS behind the scenes of max Joseph awesome movie shoot check out this Belle thats New Jersey Music this is max this behind the scenes is for his movie theres only one man that can ride a booster cord that can do this shot and thats you we need you theres no way this should it work do you think this is gonna work were literally so basically have you ever seen a flipbook and my child you are talking to the camera you can talk to the camera I like you you guys have seen a flipbook right yeah this is a flip book but kind of done in real life not in a book so if we go by all of these plaques right here at a certain speed itll create the effect of an animation Im gonna be on the skateboard holding the camera going at the exact right speed so you can take that and then you see the animation hey guys I thought everybodys here how are you all right well see how well he does first run first take is a failure all right so this is gonna be take two Im gonna come shooting down here the ground is so wet that the skateboard is like an ice skating rink go 25 miles an hour 22 miles an hour facing backwards Music take to failure   were trying some alternative means of transport now well get this its not a big deal its just the skateboard not quite right for this all right the brand new electronic bicycle Music you ready back there yet 220 miles an hour Music they still havent gotten it to work but I guess progress is being made making movies is just solving a series of tiny little problems while we were trying to fix the broken electric bicycle the Sun came out the ground is now dry helmets on I can shoot it on the skateboard problem solved for the record it was not that thing that got the shot it was my skateboard in me that got the shot he beat the machine Music give us the pitch max the video we made earlier this year do it you cant was kind of like what happens when the world and like external forces tell you that you cant and my seventh grade vice principal seventh grade vice principal to the haters the doubters my seventh grade vice principal but this is about like the seventh grade vice principal in your head those are kind of the forces I know I struggle with   I didnt upload this morning because voices in my head were telling me like my videos not good enough and I dont do it I cant do it yeah Ive got a lot of that like you cant do that or you suck at that or youre never going to do that or youre not gonna pull that off and and every time I even try to make something I have to move past all of that stuff so I decided to make this video kind of just about dealing with that voice and like how you grapple with it wrestle with it dance with it and and hopefully ultimately overcome it we are now on our way to location number two were no longer in New Jersey were back to Manhattan in the West Village the second location Music no too slow too slow Music whoo look at that one is it good Im gonna say youre going to slowly begin to men the framing your framing needs a little adjustment Music last shot of the day is in Brooklyn were going to Brooklyn now look at that do you miss this city living in LA I miss it in October and September right now the best is the best time of the year now Music Music so as you can see max is over my shoulder holding the camera in the air getting the animation while Id ride the motorcycle with one hand building the behind the scene hey Paul can you Paul can you hold this for me yeah Music thank you we got it we got the shot we got everything we need it for today but max is a little obsessive and he keeps thinking its doing it over and over and over again are we done no I even think the one before that was better its good though is it amazing amazing okay all right its like a week later Im just finishing editing this behind the scenes that youve been watching Im in my pajamas sorry Maxs movie the movie that this vlog is about were premiering that like a screening event in three days he just sent me like a rush cut of the last sequence hes gonna be super pissed at me when he knows that I shared this with you but just let me just this is like low res let me just show you how incredible there you are Music all right I cant show you anymore Maxwell stop being friends with me but movies coming out soon max youve created a masterpiece okay that is a wrap on the tooth max went to his hotel Im going to go home now Music and now Im back in Manhattan

DEMONETIZED DEMONETIZED DEMONETIZED,2017-10-17T12:05:14Z,15.383333333333333,3265345,133806,I made this video last week basic thesis of the videos that youtube doesnt do enough to support their community that is creators in the platform I didnt release it so that I was too harsh a critique and then this morning I look at my I look at the creator app here and I saw that this travel vlog which is the most innocuous vlog ever its literally me going to Indonesia to sit down with the president of Indonesia was demonetized so heres my kind of long and boring but critical commentary on YouTube and how they should do a better job looking after their community last week theres a gigantic controversy here on YouTube a controversy that I found myself just accidentally at the very heart of it had to do with D monetization and hypocrisy and unfair treatment of one channel over another on YouTube and in the end I think YouTube might actually be changing policy because of the uproar if you dont know what Im talking about I will link Phil DeFranco his video on the subject below Phil does an absolutely fantastic job of explaining the circumstances around that controversy controversy is coming Joe theres always me something people are upset about when you have as big of a user base as YouTube has what caught me I froze just how upset a huge swath of the YouTube community was at YouTube and and not just because of this controversy this controversy just proved to be sort of a catalyst for a lot of the community to speak up about what upsets them about YouTube I genuinely dont feel YouTube does enough to take care of and look after their community now before I unpacked that let me just say Im a huge fan of YouTube I am so much of my career to YouTube I traveled the world evangelizing YouTube I want this platform to succeed also I personally know much of the leadership team the executive team at YouTube I truly believe that in their heart they think and theyre working towards doing what they feel is the very best not just for YouTubes bottom line but for everybody that is the community creators the viewers everybody on YouTube I think they think that theyre really doing the best they could do I just dont agree with them I dont think that theyre doing enough for the community thats what I want to talk about any business in order to be successful you have to do things that your competition isnt doing you have to have a product that people want over whatever the competition is and then this is my very naive understanding of YouTubes business so the first tentacle of their business is search search is the way my dad uses YouTube he cant figure out how to use a cell phone he Googles it and he lands on YouTube watching a video as to how to fix his cell phone next is you have YouTube red YouTube red subscription service ten bucks a month the original content so good youre willing to give them that money so you can see their unique original content YouTube TV is 35 bucks a month and you get what is normally on regular TV but on YouTube with some other features alright the last and what I think is certainly the biggest part at least from my perspective of YouTubes business is the YouTube community thats most likely most of you watching this video people who subscribe to other peoples channels people who upload people who a big gigantic community that is a web of people all over the world that contribute that consume that considerate YouTube a part of who they are and what they do and just judging anecdotally from what Ive been able to gather and when I see all the time in a conversation that just doesnt seem to die is that a lot of the community is unhappy with YouTube the more I think about it the more I empathize with that perspective I think the community being upset is an existential threat to YouTubes entire business meaning that if if this community isnt happy if this community isnt constantly psyched about what YouTube is doing anything could prove to be a crack in the foundation of the company that is YouTube that could ultimately give way and be extremely disruptive to their business so lets rewind a couple months back to ad pocalypse which is earlier this year some controversial content put on YouTube that had ads in front of it advertisers flipped out and they didnt want to be in front of this content they went to YouTube YouTube immediately bent over what can we change how can we please you advertisers so youll continue to advertise on this platform a lot of creators a lot of that community got hit very very hard so my friend saw a drop literally of 80 imagine you have a day job you work 900 to 500 five days a week you show up for those 40 hours you work as hard as you can and for that you are paid 500 dollars a week thats your take home 500 bucks a week then ad pocalypse something completely out of your control something that you had no part of on either side and now youre still showing up at work youre still working from 900 to 500 youre putting in your 40 hours a week youre still busting your ass but instead of even paid that 500 bucks a week your take home is now 100 dollars a week okay that sucks but happens now imagine this your boss doesnt tell you whats going on you cant get in touch with your boss you dont know how to get in touch with your boss you look around for answers there are no answers anywhere and theres no one telling you whats going on will your income ever come back is it ever gonna go back to where it was how long until it goes back to where it was why is my income being affected even though Im being the same thing Ive always done and I wasnt part of the problem to begin with the thing that was most troubling for me of all of that was the lack of communication the lack of transparency on the part of YouTube the boss to the people showing up for work every day which is the community that people are uploading with a regular schedule putting the same amount of work the same amount of energy and the same amount of expense into the content theyre creating but now theyre getting paid only a fraction of what they did okay so YouTubes reaction to to their advertisers was loud and was clear were going to fix this our trust and safety issues are going to be made number one we will take care of this this is a great place for you to advertise we can give you all kinds of new tools to make this possible what they werent loud about least to the community as I understood it was how those changes are going to affect the community how they can aid the community what changes the community should expect and on and so what does this feel like from the communitys perspective its that advertisers are a bigger priority to this platform than the community so that when this controversy takes place last week wherein they D monetize a creators video for talking about a tragedy but not Jimmy Kimmel one of their bigger more corporate partners its sort of reeks of hypocrisy and again the community the community felt like a second class citizen the community felt like much less of a priority to the platform than these bigger more mainstream outlets and that that is the problem the community not feeling good about the platform this part of YouTubes business this is duplicatable somebody else could do this they might do it better but this isnt enough this here original programming YouTubes doing good work there I believe will do better work in the future but even so YouTube spending a couple hundred million bucks a year on original programming Netflix is spending 7 billion I think you can objectively say that in this facet of their business YouTubes trying to play catch up but this is a long play TV will TV its the community that makes YouTube special community is the only thing that that none of YouTubes competition has the community is what makes YouTube extraordinary community is the one thing that none of their competitors have been able to copy its the its the You Tube community community community that provides the armor that the body armor that YouTube needs against competition no matter what they do theyre not going to get through this I think that this disruption could take place when when two things happen the first thing being a competitor shows up a competitor that gives creators access to a bigger audience and gives creators better opportunities to monetize their content so the first thing that has to happen is is a really viable competitor to YouTube the second thing that has to happen is for the community to have lost faith in YouTube I dont think thats happened I hope that never happens but if those two things the community loses faith and then theres a competitor that offers a bigger audience and a better way to monetize I think theres a very real chance for disruption within the entire YouTube community and this is not apples to apples here but I point to vine vine is a company that had tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of monthly active users it was a vibrant vibrant vibrant platform but when the top 20 top 20 of their top 50 creators felt like there wasnt real opportunity to make a living off the platform and they went to the powers that be within that platform asking for more and they werent given what they needed to feel taking care of they left vine and about a year later the entire platform had to shut down there were a lot of factors why vine ran out of business but that was certainly one of them a little bit of irony the majority of those top miners that left the competing platform that offered a better way to monetize and a broader audience was in fact YouTube Music when I think back to the height the peak of ad pocalypse Id never heard the word twitch used so much within the YouTube community before people announcing their twitch shows and what their intentions were people going there who werent gamers people really redefining what that platform was true enthusiasm for competitor when you think about Netflix or Amazon or Hulu or any of these other digital distribution platforms right now theyve all got money theyre all willing to spend money and theyre trying to figure out how to diversify their audience in a way that in a way that could ultimately invite them to knock on the door of this community they may want a piece of this this is a story yesterday amazon to compete with youtube ad opportunities now this isnt exactly literally a story thats about poaching the community but I think it is I think it does illustrate the competition is looking to YouTube saying how can we get a piece of that so where does this leave us because this video is not just I didnt just make this video so I get  I made this video because I wanted to share my thinking with this my audience and maybe even share my thinking with some people at YouTube who might be seeing this solutions what are solutions that could be made short answer I dont know its not my 40 billion dollar company Im just part of this community that wants to see this platform succeed so no I dont I dont really have any real solutions but Ive said well one idea so going back to the the Jimmy Kimmel tragedy monetization situation turns out that Jimmy Kimmel was able to sell his own ads against his own content on YouTube meaning that instead of relying on YouTube to sell commercials to go in front of his videos they have their own team that sells them autonomously from the platform may be at an increased rate I dont know the details are not public but maybe why maybe can I or why cant I sell my own ads why why not build us creators or at least creators that make a living off this platform why not build us a suite of tools or a marketplace wherein we could advertise our channel and what our channel represents and maybe suggest advertisers are demographics that we feel might dovetail the vest with the content that were putting out there and because of that raise our premiums or something like that why not give us greater agency over how our content is monetized that way when there is a situation like an ad klipsch were not collectively punished along with the people who caused the controversy in the first place just a thought heres a small one your trending page I love your trending page because Im on your trending page every single week I dont know why I appreciate it but every time Im on the trending page Im cites it needs more views but but I go to Twitter and a lot of the community is gently angry at me because it seems unfair that Im always there so is it that theres a person at YouTube that maybe its just likes my work and thats why Im always there is it the algorithm I dont know but maybe a little bit of transparency there maybe something that shows us the creators why Im there icon that just says like staff pic or an icon that says like surging in the algorithm or an icon that says paid if there are videos that are allowed to be paid to be put on the trending page and that comes back to the same two principles communication transparency another one about about compensation and this seems kind of like a no brainer right now creators on your platform get paid based on the amount of ads that can run against their videos more video views the more money thats great very clean transaction but that just means the communities getting paid one time for that one ad meanwhile YouTube the company is growing is increasing in value broadly what about something where we can choose to be paid in in YouTube or in Google stock or in some sort of way that would appreciate along with the growth of the company I know that would make me feel more vested in the platform as a creator and this ones less of an actionable more of an idea but the Kardashians show Keeping Up the Kardashians its on Bravo or E or something like that whatever a new season comes out every billboard in the country is plastered with Kim Kardashians face shes celebrated shes put on TV shes in magazines theyre everywhere because the channel that hosts her show wants to make sure that people know its taking place Kim Kardashian her family is celebrated by the platform that distributes her content one thing that I see very very little of is YouTube as a company celebrating its community what that means I dont really know is it more support is it literally putting peoples faces on Billboards is it a way of elevating new creators is it a way I like I said I dont know what the actionable czar here but I do think theres but I do think that there should be a much broader initiative to show like a real appreciation for what this entire community has brought to this platform and thats something I see very very little of all right I think I should stop there I could keep going at nauseam this video is literally just a video version of a conversation I have with my YouTube peers all the time but I love and I believe in and I want YouTube to succeed on every level and when I see the community feeling upset towards the platform itself it bothers me so I want to use this channel to speak up about that all right thank you Music this is a regrettably perfect ending to this video remember that I remember the first shot of this video where I started by saying YouTube had demonetised a really innocuous video of mine I travel vlog right where I went to Indonesia I appealed their decision to demonetised it meaning that I was right it shouldnt have been d minus and what do you know look at that YouTube agreed with me Andrey monetized it and because of that because their algorithm made the wrong call it costs me now I dont know how you feel about having your income reduced because your well whoever writes your checks screwed up but it doesnt make me feel good I dont think it makes the community feel good either Music

"$250,000.00 in 48 hours",2017-10-05T18:47:14Z,3.3,1673807,62654,Im at the airport now but I want to give a quick update on the fundraiser that I launched on YouTube here a couple days ago to support these victims and the families of the victims of the terrorist attack in Las Vegas first of all we have raised thus far over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars which is unbelievable just incredible generosity one huge donation of 50 000 from GoFundMe thank you a 25 thousand dollar donation from someone who didnt put their name an anonymous person and then the other so far eight thousand six hundred plus donors all gave you know 5 10 small donations but it really adds up to a meaningful amount so when I announced this fundraiser a couple of days ago one thing that I said was I hadnt yet figured out how the money would be distributed how that custodial work would take place so I want to share today that there is another theres another fundraiser organized by the Clark County Commission Chair Steve sisal act this is an official in the Las Vegas area and the stated mission of his fundraiser is exactly what the stated mission of my fundraiser was which is just to help the victims and their families with some financial relief now his fundraiser is huge and hes trying to raise ten million dollars so what Im gonna do is at the end of this fundraiser at the end of the fundraiser that that Ive been doing all the funds will then be put towards Steve Sisco axe fundraiser and collectively itll just be one gigantic pot and then that will be distributed to the victims and their families and such so so Im very happy to be able to share that with you another thing that I want to say is its only been a couple of days since its just horrific attack took place its still fresh in everyones mind as it will be for some time so if you can please share my fundraiser or Steves fundraiser Steves fundraiser is linked below its all going in to the same place I think there are a lot more people out there who are willing and and would happily contribute to this if they knew about it so helping getting the word out could mean a lot obviously if youve already donated a huge thank you if you havent five bucks does make a difference what else did I want to share just some more details around how the money thing works right now all the money contributed is sitting in something called the direct impact fund and thats something that GoFundMe set me up with so Ill never actually see any of the money its being held in this this fund that GoFundMe put together and then from there it will go to Steve sisal axe fund raiser thats literally my plane I think thats everything I have to say thank you for your incredible incredible generosity please share share Steves fund raiser share my fund raiser share whatever youre comfortable with sharing but I think the more we can get this word out there that this initiative is taking place the more people that would be willing to contribute and ultimately the most good we can do to show the victims and their families and and everyone affected that theres a lot of good out there a lot of people that that do want to help okay thank you you,178.1818181818182,unbelievable,0.0,1.0,P8alZwCgygE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8alZwCgygE
learning the prognosis,2017-10-03T13:49:50Z,7.816666666666666,2894529,91375,okay this is it this is it I just got the word from the doctor he said call him he got back my MRI scans actually he emailed me earlier about it but I wanted to make sure I could record it so Ive been putting off this call for a few hours now in voicemail Music out on a morning run I should hear back from the doctor today to find out if I miss my running career is over or not but I realized I probably shouldnt be running right now but its a little bit like its a little bit like the final moments of the Titanic just because you know the ship is sinking doesnt mean you shouldnt enjoy the last song by the string quartet Music Applause deadlines when you have to finish something by a certain time or there are consequences Im not a big fan of deadlines in fact I hate them but I really I really operate well when I have when I have a deadline Music Music today its a pretty its a pretty serious deadline Im not nervous about this call because whatever he says because its like its already happy because for the most part its out of my control Im happy to adjust my lifestyle but its like the damage is whats to do is to say hi is this is Casey a nice that for doctors I speak yeah I didnt reach him all right yes to be can to be contained oh boy this is it you finally called me back doctor its Casey yeah I can hear you loud and clear cartilaginous life where there you can run and you can even run now Im not worried you dont have anything wrong with your phone the cartilage is normal except for like a little normal wear and tear so youre telling me Im gonna be able to run weight well this is fantastic news okay Applause Im good nothing permanent sorry my sister sorry Jordan thats my sister Jordan sorry youre no youre so  up Jordan and Im not up and Im not backed up Im good and Im still running yeah okay so Im good this is a huge deal I can still run the doctor thinks that theres like a lot of stuff going on down there but nothing that cant be fixed is nothing permanent but the point is its good he said I can run and Lupo youre in my youre like no youre good I just I just feel like I should have acknowledged you you know this is a good pivot I started this episode talking about procrastination no deadlines and I talked about how I really only function well when I have a tight deadline obviously Ive had a video in my head for a really long time the video that I made for for YouTube called do what you cant do what you cant I had a part two to that and the idea behind it is like to celebrate the fact that anyone and everyone can be a filmmaker now because of technology and like our phones and YouTube anyone can be a creator and I want to make a movie that speaks to that a much better editor than I am were working on this movie together its like 40 done deadlines and procrastination okay lets get back to work Music thats not blood its paint this is like for an animation for the movie that we are still that were still working on were like 15 hours away from deadline its coming along were just coming along slowly she is far more confident than I am which is good because shes the one in the drivers seat Music fine good luck tonight I gotta say Im really really happy that the running thing turned out okay I know that seem like like the best case scenario just worked out but it was a it did and Im thankful but it was a big deal for me were probably gonna make our deadline and good news on the running Music,89.0405117270789,procrastination,0.0,1.0,vE-mcsfxLhg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE-mcsfxLhg
LET'S HELP THE VICTIMS OF THE LAS VEGAS ATTACK,2017-10-02T18:53:54Z,4.666666666666667,1524531,89840,it is exactly 11 hours after the first shots were taken by that mass murderer by the terrorists in Las Vegas Nevada now when I woke up this morning and I learned of this attack I went through this kind of range of emotions thats not thats not really unfamiliar but it starts with being really angry like I wanted like I want to do something like I want to catch this mother and then that anger slowly turns to grief where I just feel terrible for the victims and the victims family and then it usually settles down by like right now in the emotion that I feel now is one of helplessness help us because Im just one person and I dont know what I could do and when considering what resources I have that could help people I think the greatest resource is this YouTube channel and and you this audience and an audience that I called out in the past and that has been incredibly generous anytime Ive ever asked anything Im starting a GoFundMe a fundraiser and I want to raise as much money as possible and I want to give that money to the families of the victims the victims themselves the survivors the people directly affected in a physical way from this just horrific attack and I say with with full respect and appreciation for the fact that money will will not bring back the lives that have been lost money wont wont heal somebodys wounds money wont solve the anguish in the sadness and and everything thats being felt by the people and the families of those victims money cant fix any of that but maybe maybe a little bit of money can help someone with medical bills maybe a child who lost their parent maybe they could buy some new toys and be distracted for an hour maybe money can buy a family a a meal they can go out to dinner and they can talk about things I dont know but this was the only form of action that I could think of and I know that in times of grief its not a time when you want to be thinking about earning or thinking about finances or thinking about any of that stuff so money could be helpful there too now logistically theres a lot of unanswered questions here I will tell you that I will personally make sure that none of this money is given to a charity or a nonprofit that will take the fee from it or anything like that I will work with individuals Ill work with people Ill work with organizations that will help me figure out how to get this money the money that we pulled together directly into the hands of people no middlemen taking a cut nothing like that this video youre watching right now is monetized I put an ad at the beginning in and out at the end so all of the Adsense revenue from this video will also be donated and all the pragmatic stuff all that will be updated on the GoFundMe page I think the important thing is to harness how Im feeling now and how I imagine others are feeling right now which is this desire to do something and if giving five dollars if giving ten dollars means that somebody on the other end who is dealing with this can do something positive with that then thats an action and thats something I want to end this by saying that it shocks me that any one person is capable of being that evil and the shock that I feel must be nothing compared to the shock that the people actually personally affected by that evil must be feeling so this campaign should be a way of showing those people that there theres a lot of good out there theres a lot of good people out there and our desire our capacity to help maybe can mitigate some of whats being felt by by by this this evil doers capacity to to to commit evil you,148.07142857142856,organizations,0.0,-0.9,tfZvSS_f254,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfZvSS_f254
iPhone 8 Plus vs. Note 8 ULTIMATE 4K VIDEO COMPARISON,2017-09-29T18:19:04Z,8.25,3103264,90901,Music Applause this video is going to be a comprehensive review of the video recording capabilities of the iPhone 8 plus versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 as a youtuber the video quality on my phone is one of most important things to me so thats the only thing Im gonna be looking at in this video nothing else except for what these things are capable of when shooting video I built this here rig to record video on that way the iPhone and the Galaxy are both recording the same image at the same time the lenses are as close together as possible enabling me to cut from one to the other so for the rest of the video starting right now every shot will be captured on one of these two phones enabling me to compare and contrast the image from one to the other Samsung therefore this is less of review and more of a side by side comparison I will not be issuing an opinion here I just want to show you what both of these phones are capable of okay and now a very brief studio tour using the respective cameras Music so this is my camera collection back here on the note heres a good opportunity to see the skin color differences on the iPhone versus the note 8 the iPhone here appears to be like a little bit more neutral and a little bit more dim than the note 8 which offers a kind of feels a little bright here Music bin buffer on either of these this outdoor skate for test is a very good test of the optical image stabilization which both of these phones have which should yield a buttery smooth image when you have little movements like honesty Music Music Music Music these phones both these cameras have manual features to wrack exposure rack focus Im not doing any of that for this test Im just clicking the record button and then leaving them alone so this is really a stripped down raw video test Lady Liberty that is the Statue of Liberty right there Im now going to test looking at livery Music Music Samson tends to be slightly more cool and iPhone this is the purple flower test meant to show off also this is a great way to check out the dynamic range these flowers are really bright these are in shade these shouldnt be blown out they shouldnt look white they should still be purple these shouldnt be black it shouldnt be dark they should still be purple this will be the slow all right that just about concludes my test one detail that I didnt capture in that camera test is the iPhone has 256 gigs of internal storage which is definitely a lot its enough the Samsung though has removable storage so have a micro SD card laying around but that means it uses the same SD card is like a GoPro or a lot of other cameras I prefer that but again this is unbiased sort of sampling I just want to show that detail with you the other thing I needed to say is that this side by side technique is something I stole from my friend super sad hes a much better tech reviewer than me I will link him in the description below what about me Im writing here man hello something Sam below he contributed to this video zero Music,70.54545454545455,comprehensive,0.0,1.0,Yq2sP2Lh5K8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq2sP2Lh5K8

i have a problem,2017-09-27T20:10:37Z,12.533333333333333,3425464,99782,that was in uh I was in a I was in Denver Colorado yesterday man what an incredible city that is Music alright Denver Colorado its freezing great to be here dart I I love this thing this is why Im here for Denver startup week Im speaking at Im speaking at Denver startup week entrepreneurs small businesses a lot of excited people amazing event but Denver Denvers one of those cities that I could see myself living in its its incredible here ok I got a small problem a small problem Id like to discuss with you in the spring of 2015 in one of the early episodes of season 1 of the vlog I opened a package on camera its our new coffee machine and this began mail time this is a really funny book by the way couple years it all falls into one of two categories first category is companies small companies big companies companies like shred lights theyre sending me free products like lights cuz they want me to talk about their company and what their products are the second kind of mail that I get and this is my favorite my favorite kind of mail are just like packages and letters from people were just writing to say hi and like and cool stuff like that and sometimes they send me really cool stuff too now heres the problem the problem is Ive just got Ive got too much stuff look at normally this is a couch here this is where I have meetings is on my couch theres no couch theres just boxes and then more boxes and then more boxes and more boxes and these boxes all these boxes here in my studio right now this is just like from like this weekend last weekend whatever I have a whole nother studio where my office manager Patrick works right there and then my friend Sam shares his space this is his desk but primarily what this entire space is used for is whats on the upper level here and well now now this and I mean all of this stuff here all this stuff this is all stuff that people have sent me over the years and I mean like everything up here is perfectly meticulously organized like skateboards look at look at these skateboards look at this skateboard its got me on it thats incredible how about a complete skateboard heres a complete skateboard tiny skateboard tinier skateboard big skateboard bigger skateboard skateboard thats shaped like a surfboard funny shaped skateboard but my skateboard rattling hold for skateboards and I have four skateboards in fact in fact I had to build a little thing on top of my umbrella holder here to hold one two more skateboards I need a spot for my little skateboards something someone made for me put it Tyla trees toys shoes clothing light bulbs more shoes pillows blankets and bags but look I have a second a second pillows and blankets been over here blankets pillows cups and posters lilies cups how about a helmet jacket or backpack a mattress television these garbage bags are completely filled up with clothing like t shirts and hats and sweaters and pants Andy thank you for sending me this shirt really well designed I really appreciate it I literally have 75 t shirts at home then two garbage bags over here filled up with unworn t shirts I dont know what to do with all these t shirts there are 100 comments below theyre like Casey you ungrateful mother fine people sent you that stuff you should show some appreciation I appreciate it immensely and please know that every single person who sends me anything whether its a one of these letters in the box or somebody sends me a big present or a small present or just a note that says hello every single person gets a response I send everybody stickers and then see all of these up here those are my binders where I save your letters I catalog them I date them and then I put them up there for reference for all of eternity I appreciate every single thing thats ever been sent to me but I still find myself in a position of extreme abundance to have an abundance of food and snacks because I eat all the candy and then whatever weird stuff that I dont want I just give to Oscar hey hey man is Oscar in so I find myself in this position of trying to figure out what to do with all of this stuff and you know living in New York City space is a premium here and its like I dont want to get rid of anything because I appreciate it so much for the same time its just kind of sitting in my office over there that Im paying rent on thats collecting dust so what should I do is the million dollar here Casey we know you like skateboards two guys grew up in Hawaii this is a five foot tall skateboard and its awesome and I appreciate it and thank you I just dont know where to put it Music as come on now in the past I have donated some of the toys to charities who give toys to kids Ive donated a bunch of the clothes to places where you can donate clothing and then what I really like to do is when somebody I know or sort of know needs something I just send them all this extra stuff okay seen I said and told him about my nonprofit heroes reading heroes Tomasz blown up hashtag grenade legs Im gonna share with you the goodies mr nice that decided to send me Chris was a US soldier knee at his legs blown up in Iraq he wants to make youtube videos but isnt have any camera gear so I sent him a whole box of stuff and a lot of that stuff and a lot of it was stuff that people had sent me that I wasnt using so I was able to pass on to him so Im looking for something thats more scalable that does something good that heres what I came up with all right so here heres the plan Im going to be launching an eBay store do you call an eBay store an eBay Im gonna sell everything that everyones ever sent me that I dont have a use for or someone else I can give it to then Im gonna take all those proceeds and I mean every penny like every cent thats leftover that we didnt use on shipping every cent and Im gonna give it all to whatever nonprofit I feel needs it the most at any given the current situation I have too much male stuff the answer the current situation is to store all the stuff in garbage bags this accomplishes absolutely nothing now the new way current situation the same too much male stuff but the answer is to sell it on ebay what does this accomplish well the stuff this stuff goes to people who will actually use it instead of just store it like me and then the proceeds the proceeds will help those in the most need via charities and things like that so for this first run of stuff that Im going to sell all the proceeds for that are gonna go to a couple of charities all linked below all of which are currently helping people in Puerto Rico just ravaged by a hurricane three plus million people without power down there theyre in the most need right now so Im going to donate all the cash made from selling all this stuff to help those people I hope this doesnt discourage anyone from sending me anything I do appreciate the mail I try to open as much as I can on camera and I especially appreciate the gadget because it gives me like good content we need to review gadgets like whatever this thing is now Im gonna pivot this episode for me talking about male solutions to a tech review of Music number one motorized bicycle look at this well well so far I like it a lot Applause Music hey Mira Vasco da Stern yeah can you come test this electric bike with me of course yeah do you want to ride this for the skateboard Music hey old life expectations Oscar I mean based on the hallway test I think were Im excited to see how this thing goes on the outside so what folds up yeah I dont know much about I couldnt find the manual top speed dont know its turning ability supply oh geez I guess the question becomes Oscar could you see this as a viable means of transportation in New York City I feel vulnerable on it I feel a little anxious about hurting someone else for the right kind of person you know if youre maybe not is like you dont enjoy the exercise that comes along with a bike it might work Music my biggest beef is theres nowhere to put your feet I think thats what this is for your feet are supposed to go here but they dont really organically fall there lets look at some of the features of this thing the center stand here telescoping foot pads or disc brakes yup front disc brake seat there is suspension up front LED display here new york sides its something you couldve in your apartment I mean if I look half as cool as I feel Oscar this thing seems like a home run how I always imagined you Music I think were really asserting some street presence the amazing have a street gang with like a dozen of us and leathers and chaps you know I do hes proud to see the horn everybody yields I found a weakness its up no power thanks a lot you like this one Music this is a steal ability deal ability test alright go no problem dude alright so all in all the review of the hover 1 bicycle is that its pretty good I dont know

COUNTERFEIT RAY BAN SUNGLASSES,2017-09-07T19:26:13Z,7.766666666666667,2609967,66661,I think I see a girl walking a pig got a bit of a situation its like a huge deal Bert is sort of a big deal we have a situation Music quick eight miles I gotta go deal with the situation you see the video I sent out like two days ago about the flooding in Houston and hurricane Harvey the one that had Candaces dad my father in law in it thats super important context super important context because in that video you see Candace my wife her dad Stanley explained how he was trapped in his house in Texas during the floods he had to climb through the roof and he shows his leg and its all bruised he literally lost his home due to a flood its been kind of a rough week for Stanley all right so heres the situation Stanley turned 70 its his 70th birthday this week now all the same wanted for his birthday was to go on a family trip with his with his daughters and his two grandchildren the trip has been planned for the better part of the last nine months and the trip the family trip this is his idea is to go on a cruise a cruise ship a cruise boat thats a Disney cruise boat you know like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and all that and that cruises you to leave in two days from Florida all right category five hurricane winds still 185 miles an hour on top of that Francines been so excited and we bought her all the stuffed animals and shoes and flip flops and all that stuff just for this trip thats now maybe going to be canceled so the vlogs of this week are gonna be entirely dedicated to whether or not we go on that trip Music remember my sunglasses that had the purple lenses these ones those glasses well I lost them swimming in the ocean at my friends birthday party I really missed them so I ordered another pair off of Amazon they came this week but I think theyre counterfeit Box looks legit but heres where things get fishy the texture of these does not feel right on top of that they feel a little too flexible and this shade of purple seems a little darker than how I remember it so what I dont think these counterfeiters realize is that theyre selling these glasses to someone who literally lives in a pair of Raven glasses and I can tell when they feel different and these feel different I dont think theyre legit now I did weigh them against my other glasses and they check out exactly 35 grams and when I check all the details like the Markels theyre the etching into the the logo on the side and even the text on the inside of the arm that that all checks out but I I cant place it they just dont feel right also the receipt that came with it said if theres any problem with this package dont contact Amazon contact us directly it seemed a little Shady fashion shoot behind me here this is the official ravens Soho flagship store Im hoping I can get to the bottom of this suspected counterfeit inside the store here this is not an advertisement for a band at all in fact Im not a fan of Ray Ban the brand its why I scratch their labels off of all my sunglasses but they are the ones who make these glasses so it always seems appropriate my name is Dmitry got no limit has snapped Ill just go man some 150 Instagram cats under school camisa you can count on me gentlemen you can count on me no purple okay Ive got a question for you I bought these on the internet I think theyre bullsh I think that these are counterfeits I think theyre really good counterfeits but I think theyre counterfeit I did that good we go by the fonts on the inside Im so sorry we kid you like all right so theyre convinced these glasses are legit but they didnt do a very thorough inspection and honestly I still think theyre bogus so this segment the counterfeit glass segment will happy to be continued I need to find a real expert on Raven its the new video mic Pro from Road I used to only use this microphone but I got frustrated with her or something Ive stopped using it this is the new one theyre supposed to fix all the shortcut okay ready tell me if this sounds any different youre now listening to the old mic and youre now listening to the new mic how does it sound better more clear this is what the old mic look like this is also rode mic I like this microphone I like the shock mount look I broke it and had to tape it but I do like this doesnt take any batteries expect a full comprehend Music are we or are we not going on the 70th birthday family vacation that this week but have they said if our cruise ships canceled which is really up like what if people need to get medications for more than five days honey and you do best assessment are these counterfeit yes I theyre kind of tithing to the store and they said theyre not counterfeit they just look really cheap right so whats the verdict fake okay all right well thank you so much for letting us know so we just wait to hear from the travel agent or what happened Disney Cruise canceled no Music so I do just want to say since since I recorded this vlog episode just like two days ago that hurricane hurricane Irma has has hit land on a couple of islands in Puerto Rico and it looks like its headed for Florida and it is proven to be like an absolutely devastating devastating storm so my stupid vacation to go see Mickey Mouse doesnt really matter but lots of thoughts and and really just best wishes for anyone and everyone whos in the trajectory of this storm and is being affected by this like deadly truly terrifying

FAMILY HOUSE DESTROYED IN THE HOUSTON FLOOD,2017-09-04T15:12:59Z,11.1,2689737,85073,Applause Music so just arrived in Houston Candaces parents live here in Houston they live in one of the neighborhoods that was really badly affected by the floods here for two days just to help them dig out I really dont I dont know what to expect its uh its this house here you can pull it this is what he put up for help the furnitures been dragged all over the house this is the floor look how gnarly so this is completely underwater yeah this was the last place he was before he went to the ninja whats the plan just tear the house down to the Payette air loss fast outlook machine thats Candace for middle school Music Music so this is it this like River situation right here this is the culprit Candaces parents house is just over the berm that way to give you an idea of scale this is about I dont know 10 or 20 feet deep of like concrete foundation here and then above that the grass you see is another another 25 feet or so Im from the very bottom is concrete at the very top of the grass its probably like 40 50 and thats the height at which campuses parents houses the very top of where you see the grass here and the water at its highest was probably 8 to 10 feet above that Music Music Music Music Applause so Candices grandma canvasses grandmother here in 1966 this is from south africa and this is Candaces mom Music Applause Music so that operation behind me is to dry out all the old family photos its sad its hard to learn all the old photos I can only imagine what its like for for a Candices parents having like raised their entire family in this house to see how to see all this water but to yet there was nowhere left to go I went from a low base to a higher base so when it got today I said I have to get out of there and that the current was too much outside I and I had the God so I couldnt have the dog swimming around and the current so I chopped out the skylight with a hammer got sick that is you had to hit it with a hammer and smash out this piece it was covering Italy and then I climbed out the window then a a risk you cross what does that mean never again never Music Music so its Saturday now its its tomorrow we spent most of the day today finishing digging out Candaces parents house its sad its tragic Candaces parents lost a lot they lost their home they lost a lot of their possessions but they have savings they have insurance theyre going to be fine where Im headed right now is to go visit some people who had it much worse than Candaces parents and theyre being assisted by by a group of individuals called team rubicon come explain what it is that team rubicon does sure so do you akan on profit organization and what we do is we recruit trained and deployed military veterans for disaster response so we take the men and women whove been served in the US military we combine their skills and experience with first responders like firefighters police officers we send them into positions like this where you know theyre helping people as we like to say on their worst day and in doing so you know we see that these military veterans are finding this sense of purpose again that really reinvigorates them is you know they transition at the military as you can see behind me we found a family here in a suburb of Houston you know this home lacked insurance but its a for us its particularly special when we can help a fellow veteran out this was furnished this was somebodys home less than less than seven days ago seven days ago they went to sleep they knew the hurricane was coming this area of Houston and never flooded before and they woke up the mom at 500 am she got out of bed the water was ankle deep within 30 minutes it was at their waist and this this refrigerator right here actually picked up from this part of the house loaded and pinned their daughter against the island that was right here and she actually has a contusion on her leg that goes about a mid thigh down the middle of her calf and it pulled a fridge offer Music firstly I had to take all the furniture all the clothes all the knickknacks everything every possession that this family owned and take it out to the curb wheres the family now its the thing theyre doing now so the the family staying at a Hilton hotel we had a gentleman come through and he wanted to meet the family came in and when he learned that they were staying at a Hilton they expressed that they couldnt even really afford it for 150 a night and the guy asked if he could pay for it he handed him you know four thousand dollars right there just just to make sure they didnt have to come out of pocket it was you know there was the first time we saw that the the man who owned the home this Navy bed was the first time I actually saw him break down and cry it was it was pretty powerful Music Thank You Man appreciate what your family safe Im Jenny Ill put a link below to Team Rubicon they are nonprofit send them some love there theyre doing a lot of really good work down here Music things that I can I take myself

ABOUT THE NOTE 8,2017-09-02T14:58:27Z,7.266666666666667,2006832,61907,I dont care what you say if youre in New York City you gotta buy chicken guys Music today lets talk about my today lets talk about my new cellphone I got the note e now the only review anybodys really interested in when it comes to the note e is the note 8 versus the iPhone 8 which I happen to have right here Im just kidding this is because the new iPhones not out yet and thats really all I care about is this versus the new iPhone Im not gonna do a comprehensive review instead think of this is like a first look and then I want to tell you why I like phones and computers with stylus is stylized stylus and as always in the name of transparency please know that this review is extremely biased while I was not hired or paid by Samsung to make this video i have worked with samsung in the past I work with Samsung in the future so this is a biased video Music sighs now the note 8 is objectively a gigantic gigantic phone its the biggest phone that I could find in my arsenal its huge in a kind of direct side by side comparison its a little bit bigger than the s8 plus its a lot bigger than the s8 regular its a lot bigger than an iPhone 7 I dont have an iPhone 7 plus but thats like you know thats like this big good like swallow an iPhone 5 its big but I wouldnt say it feels too big in the hand in fact it feels really good in the hand and my jeans which fit pretty tight so slides in there nicely you know its a big phone but compared to like what we have in our pockets anyway but the feel the feel is really good it has like a heavy density to it a robustness to with it it feels good what I do want to talk about is the idea of a big screen phone with a stylus for me thats the magic recipe I dont know why I think its probably like the tactile nature being able to actually use my hand to draw something if you notice Ive been doing some of my vlog credits in my own handwriting Ive been doing that on my iPad using procreate its amazing quick aside Apple theres nowhere to put this 100 pen you can sort of put it there but like where is it now its gone I dont understand that Ive had to buy three of these things so far Samsung gives you this little sleeve which isnt so pretty but its functional and then on the surface I got this really confident inspiring magnets things not going anywhere but Apple where am I supposed to put this thing I think a big part of it is that Ive got really fat fingers look at the size of my fingers theyre like hot dogs and thats not a big deal what Im trying to touch use the touchscreen on a smaller phone like this like look how much of my fingers are too fat if youre inarticulate non specific like I disagree with Steve Jobs on this one who wants a stylus you have to get them and put them away and youll lose him yuck nobody wants a stylus but the stylus whether its on an iPad or a tablet or on a phone it enables like another level of interaction I wish that this laptop had a touchscreen because and that Final Cut Pro was optimized for like stylus because if I could interact with my media when editing video like this instead of down here with this I feel like to be much more effective Music well dont turn dont turn you give me a ride Chris nice to meet you Chris its more than just the stylist I like the stylist the stylist is important when you combine the stylist with having something that fits in your hand like a notebook but its more than just a detail think of it typing for example or data entry on a phone without a stylus without a stylus this is how you type with a stylus this is how you type and to me thats a more elegant or organic way of interacting with something its exactly how I write if I had a notebook and a pen and then if you take that idea and you dont just look at typing but you sort of look at tip photo editing for example theres this because precise and its almost like using a mouse and a cursor and then this were like fat fingers get in the way of whatever Im trying to do this thing that seems done so its actually integrated across the software here which makes it is that I should caveat that by saying I still havent really used this thing but the note 7 when they recall that was my favorite phone ever I do I do thank you very much Donna thank you see what I want when I walk from a phone its perfect more like a computer remember the palm treo that phone had a keyboard and a stylus that felt like a little computer I mean nothing stuck compared to todays phone standards but the way you interacted with it was more computer like than this go into our Santa Monica see you can get worked on these things just by using your thumb and hammering away but in a pinch it does act like a computer you can actually get work done so thats it my thesis is more based on like the note as a phone less than this specific once Ive actually played with this much yet but I hope it makes sense and it is like my my favorite phone Im happy to have it back maxie you see it do we have the same shirt on

Samsung thanks for having me just one quick question where my note ate at you usually really good about giving me the new the new devices hey its tomorrow its tomorrow morning look I got one video when I went to see the total lunar no total solar eclipse it was amazing but a lot of people have been asking how did I shoot the actual scene when the Eclipse happen because I had a lot of coverage so I thought I would explain first you should know I had five cameras shooting simultaneously while the Eclipse took place two of those cameras were flying cameras first the perfect overhead shot about five minutes where the eclipse took place I sent a phantom for like this straight up in the air about 1 500 feet above the ground where I was standing camera pointed straight down like this then I set the location to lock so it wouldnt move too much and I hit record and then I just kind of forgot about a second camera the one that went over the crowd just as it got dark that was this custom Casey Neistat Mavic right here setting a trajectory on the app minute it got dark I just hit start through the controller so this thing went by itself third camera that was that wide angle sping time lapse shot I got that by putting a gopro hero4 on an egg timer I could Sony t t t t t t t t t t and thats why in the last shot of the video when you see me pull this thing down you can actually hear the egg timer fourth shot thats the shot of the Sun staring directly into the Sun that was done using the camera that Im actually filming this on right now which is a Panasonic Lumix gh2 h5 with a long lens on it and then I put a little sunglasses over the lens to create a filter and film the Sun I had to remember to lock focus and lock exposure before I hit record camera number five was like the can I talked into was like the main vlogging camera and that was this year Sony rx100 mark 5 this I use because it has the best low light and I knew no matter how dark it got that this thing would give me like a consistent rock solid image plus the big camera here was busy shooting the Sun and that is how one person shoots with five cameras to get five angles to capture a minute and 44 seconds of totality are you telling me that you built a time machine yeah that was Austin Texas for the South by Southwest Film Festival 2008 Applause it was a big day what was taking place theres my friends Josh and Benny safty thats Josh Casey Benny they made this movie I sort of helped them make it I organized the funding for it for that they bestowed me with an executive producer credits but this was us premiering the movie at a film festival for the first time how do you feel about this screening we word nerve it was it was a great movie those guys made a great we made a great movie but this was a tiny tiny theater that there werent that many people there hey Jeffy is that look that was a really big deal for us Josh and Benny those two guys theyre two of my oldest friends there are two people that have motivated and inspired me as a filmmaker my whole life Im talking about them now because they have a huge feature length like big time movie thats coming out in all the movie theaters this weekend thats where they started guys ready and they made it they did it their movie that comes out this weekend starts Robert Pattinson that thats huge really handsome movie star those guys did it we used to make movies together when this is what a video camera look like hey Casey say hi hey hey Im not being paid for this or anything theyre just my friends I love those guys in any promotion I could help them with I would do as if that isnt enough to celebrate who produced their new smash hit feature length movie my dear friend Oscar Oscar is one of the first people that ever worked for my brother and me and we hired him the day after he moved to New York City when he was like 21 or something this video is him opening his Christmas presents from Van and me I know it looks like a lot of money that is like less than one weeks pay those were all one dollar bills a movie is called good time directed by the sastras thats Josh and Benny produced by Oscar boysson Oscar how did you go from being my assistant to a famous big time movie producer just by never taking no for an answer kind of following believing I could do anything which I learned in the nice dad studio alright seriously this guy would just over and over again Id never seen anything like it you just say youre smart figure it out youre smart figure it out youre smart figure it out I dont care how long it takes just make it beautiful and that sounded a little weird at the time because youre used to work in a restaurant or being a landscaper but its actually really empowering and it took me a while to figure that out and the more movies I made the more I realized it didnt matter it kind of applies to everything Oscar how did you get Robert Pattinson of Twilight Fame to star in this movie two years ago about two years ago today Robert Pattinson saw an image from a movie that I also produced that Josh and Benny also directed and he emailed Josh and Benny and said I want to do whatever you guys are doing next so Robert Pattinson came to you came to Josh and Danny to be in this movie or a movie yeah and Josh said be careful because when we say were going to do something we actually do it which is not something that happens the movie business very often I want to bring up the Rotten Tomatoes oh yeah Rotten Tomatoes here Game of Thrones their movies opening this week look at this look at this look at this good time 90 thats more than all these other movies thats kind of it for my plug for good time Ill end this by saying this is not a movie for children theres gratuitous violence theres drug use theres profanity but it is the movie that the young aspiring filmmaker version of me well yeah so psyched I would have seen it and said I want to make it look like a Martin Scorsese movie from the 1970s if that means anything to you okay last detail if you are in New York City tomorrow if youre in New York City August 24th 2017 were what are we doing like hosting a screening Oscar and I are

MEXICAN/TEXAN BORDER,2017-08-17T18:35:28Z,9.75,1805784,52984,Music its 630 in the morning Brett this house in Marfa Texas everybodys asleep except for me and Daniel here were up so we can go for a quick run before we start the day getting ready to push off now it saves me a long day of location scouting this is like honestly what is that day I mean they say its a mass but it looks more like that so were right here this is Mexico yeah this interest is all women the road now I can remember were and this was the road like the Halloween Havoc up turn hours really this is so now were on the dirt road the next stop is the Mexican border of the Rio Grande but what were doing here today is were doing more location scouting for Maxs movie max made do what you can with me earlier this year now Im helping him with his doing you cant movie it sort of begins with a crazy idea where we need a long stretch of road and todays location scouting is to find that perfect long stretch of road I dont think thats Music I know this topic about but furthering reconnaissance here lets go find it okay I must be really rusty am i drowning or something so I cant find new york city anymore i havent been in the blogs much Ive crashed it three times today and I just crashed into a telephone wire any sign of it village its gotta be around here in this rock formation I think is what we do theres got to be there what that means boom boom its right there you buy that I mean seems fine just broke its leg this broke off aggressively I guarantee you this thing still works should not explain the whole idea for Maxs movie the requires shooting out of the window of a cause its moving at a certain speed to capture you guys going to test it with the stabilizer here they come is there using the stabilizer to see if they can get a stable shot of the window of this car traveling at that speed I mean thats where it in the animation is playing in here right thats pretty smooth its pretty smooth yeah you cant tell that especially if thats not like thats not the best stabilizer either right if this is not the best one its not that were getting Travis okay this room is not going to work its now long enough stretch and its not too bumpy you gotta slow down a little big question uh huh gas station about three hours away I give this road like a be mine okay and what do you whats acceptable B plus a month we call all weather markup syrup yet I have to join from hell touch him right by the neck bite the head off so whats up a fake oh my god Karen open this idea that may be closer to the border therell be a more like open road thats more interesting looking so were headed to the border of Texas and Mexico Music so not a hundred percent as to where we are but were definitely right at or right near the border Mexico Texas were not going to Mexico a guy we just met at a bar the most remote bar in all of Texas according to him is taking us 200 feet this way to the Mexican American border theres no law enforcement here keith is the only law enforcement is that water escort cartel but he says that would no sense of irony before such spasm the river is over there behind that tree so wheres Mexico thats Mexico sit the tree with limbs off of it lets make showing this out of the Texas Mexico Texas Mexico Mexico call text browsing its mobile plan are we in Mexico look like going to use its on candy that better right there yeah bring the tech waited every day morning fun wheres the warning sign right here now you do have to say that it says warning allele the care farm in New Mexico oh wait we cant but we cant do think oh dude I already got a references turn out yet remember football you let you far turn around pull why did you take us all the way down here can we turn around here its a double yellow Im a tall up there were here because you cant go any further south and the Continental why Mexico why is that important why is that relevant here move it the whole idea is that the road were going to pick a road thats going to tell us a story and the only way we can see that story is by traveling around is traveling on that road and the story that that road is going to tell us is about where it is in the world and this this road thats right here basically on the us mexico border has a lot of stories to tell good bad drugs immigration buffalo soldiers Pancho via theres I mean pick your poison there are a million things that happen on these roads right here in this part of America and like I think they have something to tell Music back there like Border Patrols here we go next why are you filming um I got a guy got to get this at all cost Ill pass where youll like me Im not insured miss party is Daniel his lights arent on yet back off take the blade prong angled over I have no I had no idea pass out though for stopping speed sir something off brown yeah hi guys super friendly police officer here give us a warning but theres one small problem with the insurance the rental we should be fine Music were back at the house right now and todays pre production when I think very well weve got like a pretty tight Tamela what were doing here Dylan helping us writing this is Max Vidya Maxs video and Im this kind of like this is a big movie where max can have done in two months the goal is to make it like Maxs do what you cant story like his

She's a Blind YouTuber,2017-07-25T18:13:56Z,12.233333333333333,2843324,153801,Music its going to feel like 100 to 105° in the city and for so many so heat advisory is in effect for the city for Westchester all of us really the song Hot In the City by Billy Idol was written when he lived in a one bedroom studio and it was like 100° out and he didnt have air conditioning and that that was his inspiration for that song great Applause song on a hot summer night dont be afraid all the world we made on a hard summer night I mean its not like if youre in Arizona or somewhere like that its not crazy hot but look 93 thats pretty hot for New York City uh something I really like to do here on YouTube is find smaller or newer or less well known YouTubers and then share those YouTubers that I really like with you my audience I like to do that cuz it kind of gives them a little bit more exposure and and Id like to think that if you watch this channel that youre also interested in what Im interested in any event I have a YouTuber thats coming by right now that Im very excited for you to meet but Music first Music shes here hello wait wait am I looking is right there right there there right there okay got it this is Molly Mollys a YouTuber we met at VidCon yes okay and this is how it went I walked into some lounge or something like that theyre all place a bigc and I heard somebody whisper I think thats Casey neistat and at VidCon I kind of hear that a lot so I didnt think much of it I turned around and went to see who said that so I could say Hi and then I saw this girl right here say um well is it him or is it not him and whoever you were speaking to was like I cant tell and youre like well I cant tell Im blind I cant see him is it Casey or not thats how I met Molly and thats how I found out that you cant see yes so how is someone both blind and a YouTuber Molly well there was a a bit more that went into the decision to make YouTube videos than maybe for most people because obviously like I cant set up my camera on my lighting I cant make sure Im in Focus I cant edit my videos and so there was there was more that had to go into figuring all that out and my mom comes down and she films with me so shell make sure Im in Focus she takes the thumbnails so in short always have a mom that trust to tell you you look good on camera I was saying Im like Cinderella I have my own Talking Mirror everywhere I go and my mirrors name is mom have you always been blind Ive always been visually impaired I havent always been blind um until I was 14 and in grade 8 the disease was kind of triggered and I I lost pretty much the majority of my vision to what I have now what can you see now like what do you see now like theres a bright light this bright light and then theres me and theres my camera like what what do you see so I see the world in light and Shadow I can see light so I can see that theres a big square of light and like I can see that theres a a little bulb above us and that theres different lights and that theres strips of lighting on the ceiling and that theres like globe lights hanging over there but I cant see um uh or no depth perception rather so I dont know if that light is in Touching distance or if its far away can you see me at all see when you like look towards the light and stuff I can see that theres there shining on your glasses so if I sit right there I can see that your glasses are right there two little spots but thats all I see so then everything around those two little spots reflecting off your glasses is totally black so you dont know what I look like not at all before you lost your vision did you ever see a movie with Brad Pit in it what got you to a place of wanting to share so much of who you are in your life to the world bullying been a big problem it was a big part of my life when I lost my vision I also lost all of my friends and and so I could take this negative thing that happened to me and make it something positive for other people were going to go outside now and Mollys going to share with me what its like to be visually impaired right mhm yeah Im going to borrow your scarf okay buddy okay buddy thank Music you all right fly hold on Im ready to go yeah okay so youre just going to have to trust that I cant see is this recording see now you know what its like to be blind Zach yeah why I have a you have to trust that I cant see anything so a lot of people when they like want to help a blind person like try to grab our hand or push us or grab our shoulders not the right thing to do grab the elbow offer the elbow so youre going to grab my right elbow cuz Gallup is trained to always always be on my left so the Im going to come over in front of you grab your right elbow so I stand on your left elow right there okay I just know how many like axes and things are hanging in this studio Ive never been so scared in my own office before okay uh yeah and the button I believe is on the left side oh oh I found I think a fire thing we wont we dont want to play with that oh I found the button do you have rail on the buttons were were going to see ah this is interesting you guys ride down take the stairs down okay there is rail right no this is interesting for both of us see now youre seeing different accessibility issues like were going up yeah I do too I think were going to have a long elevator ride oh I found a a be Sor is this the first floor uh second floor second could you push the button for the first floor please sure all right were here no this is like a narrow hallway yes it is theres a stair here there is yeah just stop it okay we have successfully made it to the front door oh how do I open this is there is there a I can do that got it got it lets go left lets go get coffee okay ah ah ah there we go were going to hit the street soon cross the street and then at the end of the next block is a coffee shop on the left so what do you do what do we do we ask what do we do yeah well have to ask so is this a walk sign how do you know when theres somebody to ask well you have to listen that sounded like traffic was going south which means we can go the bo but it sounds like traffic has always been going south okay lets just risk it I might kill you today but I appreciate that youre taking this risk with me how do we know were at the curb G we stop were at the curb an so he stops for stairs for curbs I can ask him to find me doors so when I get to the corner then Ill ask him to find the door yeah do you smell like everything so potent and everything yeah like thats a clothing store see you learned this like youre used to like always hearing the music from that store so you know its a clothing store right here I dont know okay so this is a door do feel like door the its a this is a double it smell maybe it smell like a coffee not probably not oh Im Smelling Coffee now huh I dont oh yeah you smell that yes yeah yeah I think so how do you know when its your turn to order is it my turn to order yeah thats how I know um so how do you know that someones not ripping you off in you head you dont really so how do I touch the their touchcreen you have to ask them to help you can you help me can you tip 1 you dont mind me how do you know like what sugar to put into your coffee I asked okay so Im going to take off my blindfold now um wow that was an absolutely like jarring experience for me mhm it was um it l like everything I knew about life youre experiencing it in a different way completely reset cuz youre experiencing it with your ears with your nose with your hands like I always say my hands are my eyes because Im always like touching things to find theres more than that like in a in a in a weird way and I say this very gently it was much scarier I was afraid that I was going to touch somebodys butt I was afraid that she was going to charge me too much with my coffee they never would hear but I just mean in general that was something that occurred to me I was afid we were going hit by a car I was afraid we were going to offend the people around us I was afraid I wasnt even to get the right coffee like I think the biggest thing with that you know what this is what I always tell people for you I just threw you into this experience and youve never done it before so of course its going to feel really scary and its probably going to feel overwhelming and its probably going to feel like you cant do it but the reality is this is my normal this is my every day and for people who are in wheelchairs for people who are blind for people who are deaf or missing a limb this is our normal you know Ive been blind for 9 years I dont know life with sight anymore so for me asking for people to help me all the time or for me listening to the traffic surges or for me listening and smelling different places to know where I am is normal and so to me its not difficult and its not scary and its not jarring its normal um and its just life I wake up I do my makeup I make my breakfast I take my dog out I do my own makeup yeah pick my own outfits you know I do I just live like Molly before you go I made a present for you what okay its here oh my goodness do I have my own Casey sunglasses yes I made you a custom pair of my sungl see how they look on you oh my God they look great on you look at this I even engraved your name on the side a i engraved a note on that side and then what what does it say thank you okay lets put them on and well take a lets see how we both look with our they look good on you they fit you

THE KILIMANJARO STORY,2017-07-18T18:39:37Z,10.166666666666666,2724863,83195,Music where is Ben still no Music Ben then we said 850 under the Manhattan Bridge its 850 and Im under the Manhattan Bridge where are you Music buddy you know then we make plans we say were going to meet at a certain time theres B that was another super casual 13 and 1 12 mile run this morning Ive been running like crazy lately I mean Ive been running like 13 14 15 miles a day every single day for the entirety of this summer I just I cant get enough and I have been getting a lot of questions on Twitter about people who are curious about running maybe Ill make like a Caseys guide to running video or something but a quick piece of advice for newcomers to running if youve never run before the only thing you should be focusing on is time like can you run for 5 minutes without stopping and then 10 minutes without stopping and then a half an hour without stopping dont worry about Pace or anything like that get to that later focus on the amount of time you can spend on your feet cuz that thats the first hurdle to overcome okay okay today on the Vlog I want to do something a little bit different something I used to do and I havent done this is a special edition episode Music cheers Caseys a good driver nice mustache dude its a Sir Walter Raleigh that was 2008 2008 that was 2008 in Zanzibar Zanzibar is a little island off the coast of Tanzania Tanzania okay were jumping on a little plane to go to Zanzibar now theres a beach there this special edition Vlog is the story of when Graham and Casey and Clint and van went to Africa and climbed Mount kilamanjaro so were going to Tanzania to climb the tallest freestanding mountain in the world thatd be kill him in jaro have I made a vlog about this no right no well youve mentioned it in different Vlogs so I never made this Vlog youve never made an exclusive Killy Vlog but the doctors Im getting a thats what I look like without a shirt on 10 years ago yellow fever hepatitis typhoid and polio vaccination is that it doctor you had to get shots to go to Tanzania for like malar what was it malaria yellow fever yeah and hepatitis A and B ready polio tetanus typhoid so that was the Dream Team it was Van Casey Clint Graham this is definitely Graham sleeping on the airplane we didnt yeah thats we didnt have a plan for anything its our first day here we decided to start the climb immediately knew that we should if we went there with enough cash that we would find somebody to take us up the mountain which was the case f naturally we went with the cheapest least expensive guides we could find lots of dough to get up to the top of Karo four five they were great nice guys um but I think we realized on our way there that what the value package got you yeah very cheap meat were picking up the meat that were going to eat on our hike the top the mountain here it is now getting this thats our Cuts so this guy turtle is one of the guys that was the best on the team and he was the official whiskey imperio you guys like whiskey whiskey well it was weird cuz we stopped at a grocery store to get food for the climb and and all that the African guides were suggesting is that we buy lots of alcohol for them yes whis its our guides idea to bring whiskey up to the summit to drink were about to start our mission up to the top of kilara one thing thats was amazing about this climb is you literally started in a rainforest and on the last day we were like standing on snow and ice that is Mount kilamanjaro my thumb is blocking the sun we have all these dudes carrying all of our stuff but it wasnt our choice what are you shooting shooting the uh Porters Porters are carrying up all the gear but just the sheer amount of that they are carrying the law in Tanzania mandates that for every climber you have at least one person carrying uh your gear and its a way to like bolster local economies but also they do it for safy we could have carried our own sh we tried to they wouldnt let us this is us setting up camp on our first night not actually us setting it up other people setting it up but for us when we were booking the guides we were told we would have a high quality Chef traveling with us this is the tent where they cook the food what was his name turtle turtle was the chef turtle was the chef ooh thank you guys G celebrated his uh 25th birthday on Mount kilan jar happy birthday to you birthday to you happy birthday dear Happy Birthday to You great birthday dinner I dont know why I thought it was a good idea to climb Mount kman d own sneakers supposed to wear hiking boots when youre climbing the highest freestanding mountain in the world but you chose sneakers my hiking sneakers are frozen solid this is going to be a problem two days in you can really start to notice me fading I look like a really ugly woman and this is our campsite on the second day we thought itd be a good idea that instead of spending 6 days climbing we would spend 3 days climbing twice as fast then we could use the rest of our time in Africa to travel it was a great idea until the morning of the summit climb the craziest part of being up here is that were above the clouds I just want to point one thing out also the red hat that Caseys wearing so were making the summit push tomorrow so not only did he not bring hiking boots but he also didnt bring a hat so that was a hat that Ive had since grade school camp this is Camp the third day freezing out here youre about to witness the moment when this entire trip for me went from being a fun dont laugh a fun adventure to just an absolute its uh its the last day were climbing to The Summit in the morning its about 20 below out freezing uh feeling strong how you feeling Graham strong next shot will be from the peak so in the end we made it we we summited Applause Music after summit though we did fly straight from the mountain to Zanzibar this tropical island off the coast of Tanzania and that was like todays our last day in Zanzibar and then we are coming home to New York and that uh that is the story of when Graham and I with van and Clint climb Mount kilamanjaro Applause this is pretty Music just as an aside this is an unpaid endorsement but this is Grahams new company Grahams an entrepreneur its why were such good friends we share a lot of similarities what is this Graham man can is awesome wine 100 California wine hey gram this isnt one of your infomercials I just wanted to show to my audience that youre also a badass entrepreneur okay thats it see you

WE GOT A BABY GOAT!!!,2017-07-12T18:34:05Z,10.75,2231261,65264,we got to go we got to go coming in coming in and touchdown the I normally run with likes big fat beats headphones but I sweat a lot and get really nasty and today I finally killed by like deep running head bro a wearing amethyst girl Hector Music of thirteen point one five miles and a 730 days not that host2 awesome his mother for later today thats why I have on my raincoat Music Ive got a quick meeting with Jake this morning and then and then about two hours then the goat Im not like Jake meeting but Jake is not fi Jake meeting Jake youre nine minutes late Oh glad you can make it Jake Im sorry legal trouble are you in trouble lets do the next story to be precise were doing a were did beam story about illegal I guess legal drugs yeah legal drug in case kind of spearheading it so suddenly out there were suddenly outside to make sure what we can and cannot do on camera sounds of serious Jake good meetings youre needed good meeting drinking alright I got a I got to go because Im now less than one hour away from go by Jake I havent done in a while yeah I stopped doing them because I mean I got a little bit bored I havent done it I havent got a solid QA Music what was your dream job as a child I didnt necessarily want to be an astronaut or like a movie star or anything like that I think the only thing that I knew when I was younger is I didnt want to have a boss like I didnt want to have to answer to somebody else do you ever become annoyed when people stop you in the street for photos the answer is typically no except for when Im with my family I dont do selfies like when Im carrying the baby no way and then when Im running like I dont want to stop thats not cool and then the biggest one is when people wait outside my office I know its my fault because I used to film out there but I cant do selfies outside my office my building manager freaks out people in the building dont like it and it just causes like what happened to your thumb if you notice my left my right my left thumb usually has paint on it but at a minor circular saw incident with the thumb and I completely picked up my finger I put fingernail polish on to remind myself not to mess with it and to let it heal I appreciate everybodys concern Im going to be fine will you ever go back to Canon cameras yeah Im using a Panasonic Lumix cameras right now I was using Sony or so like Sony truth is I like them all I have no loyalty to any one camera brand why dont you show Francines face anymore ah you know when friends stop being like a baby and started looking like a person Candace and I decided to keep her out of social media you know oh and my older kitty is 19 he liked that I want to be in a video or dad I dont want to be in your videos and its his decision but you know shes   I didnt want to pressure her into something that later in life she might not want to have been a part of I hope that makes sense believe me I would love to have her cute little baby face in these videos I got a lot more thumbs up when she was in them heres a little bit of a loaded question thoughts on Jake Paul and Logan Paul okay for like the three of you who dont know Jake Paul and Logan Paul are two young guys from Ohio they used to be Viners and then they started on YouTube and now theyre like huge I mean like apocalyptically the hugest thing to ever happen to youtube and Im not saying that hyperbolically that is the truth Jake did like five million subscribers in like six months the most views Ive ever done on this channel in a single month I think 50 million views and thats what like one insane viral and vlogging everyday Jake last month is like five hundred million views like these guys are stratospheric in their success on YouTube but theyre a little controversial I find that especially other youtubers love to shun Jake and Logan Paul so heres my opinion about Jake and Logan Paul first as people yeah I know Logan I know Jake a little bit and I can tell you that like and I can tell you then all the time and so then theyve always been like really nice guys like Logan I would consider a friend of mine I was in his feature film which I was psyched to do I moderated a panel that he and a bunch of his collaborators were on once Jake genitive interacted with less but you know Jake is a mind of an entrepreneur and sort of like a year ago he and I had a bunch of conversations around the businesses that he was interested in starting in I was just really impressed by Jake such a young guy had such a mind and such ambition and then theyve done some stupid Logan stunt at VidCon like Logan what were you thinking and Jakes done some silly stuff but like look Ive done some really stupid stuff in my youtube channel that you guys have given me like such a hard time for rightfully so and I think that you have to judge people by the totality of who they are not so my feelings on the Paul brothers and go easy on me in the comments for saying this is that I am super impressed and excited for their success Im happy for them and I really appreciate their ambition before you discount their success try succeeding on your own its not easy to succeed on any level especially the level at which theyre succeeding so drama and nonsense aside theyve done something that I think is extraordinary how do you feel about Hawaiian pizza I really like pineapple on my pizza when will beans new channels of the Live bheemsen channel is already live were just not really theres nothing up there yet theres kind of a harsh question what is happening to the vlogs it feels different completely incoherent is it taking I hope the vlogs arent completely incoherent I will say that Im not like uploading on a regular schedule and the narrative of the vlog is not really succinct so yeah maybe theyre a little bit incoherent Im sorry I like Im really my focus right now is on family is on what Im doing it beam my focus is all over the place right now and I definitely I still love making videos so I try to find time like today to make videos like this but cocoa puffs or Froot Loops cocoa puffs I was Candice of company Billy coming along ah because for me to end on its time to ask you to go go go hi Im here to see the goat here this is a ghost Candace is doing a photo shoot for Billys lookbook and dad goes and why have goats for a lookbook billy goats are you to go to handle i am trying to meet horse carriage this everybody knows this is above the line these are handled properly and thankfully and these goats are well looked after and handled by proper handler yes but theyre very humanely treated theyre just beautiful animals that were taking pictures of this is Francine she forgot it here okay Candice explained to explain what this is the photoshoot telling you stuff coming out to Philly website really where did you find the models how long have you been a model you like it how many huge have you done that have goats involved P when do we get a picture Music what do you think Wow I think its very great how many times in your life has somebody said to you I have this great idea for a product or a great idea for a company great idea for a business and it starts and it ends there with the idea the hardest thing in the world to do is go from 0 to 1 to go from that I have an idea to actually doing it I remember when Candace said to me I have this idea for a company for a new line called Billy and now its like two years later and she got the new office and employees and that photo shoot its like their man and its like a real thing and it you never stop the breath Music

OMG!!!  DJi Spark CAN DO IT!!!,2017-07-10T18:40:48Z,11.166666666666666,5361272,97934,Music Laughter Music this is the DJI spark com DJI spark fly combo fly more combo pack this is the official DJI spark I did do an earlier video about the spark but that was with the Prototype unit this is the official shippable unit as it will appear in stores biggest detail here in this box is the controller for the spark now for this video Im going to be comparing the spark with the controller to the DJI mavic with controller I do want to make it abundantly clear before I begin this review that Im not being paid by DJI Ive never been paid by DJI this is an impartial review but I am a huge fan of DJI so its sort of like a little bit biased because I like their product so much first the Music unboxing documentation this is the actual drone battery extra propellers here controller propeller guard charger AC adapter for charger thats everything the bag you get the case you get the Drone itself eight I think eight propeller blades four propeller guards you get the charger and you get two batteries and I think it maybe even comes with an SD card this is 699 bucks seems like a good deal now one interesting tidbit I did want to zero in on because this thing is all about portability is this is the case it comes with so this is the Cas you need for the batteries for the charger for the controller for everything this is the case that the mavic comes in now the mavic is a considerably bigger drone than the spark but at the end of the day you need all this stuff with you so youre carrying it all in the Case mavic Case spark case theyre almost the same size so theyre going to take up almost the same amount of real estate in your backpack thats an interesting consideration okay lets get into this this is the controller for the DJI spark and this is a controller for the mavic both extremely similar looking devices is I will say this one feels the uh spark one feels a little bit lighter and like maybe a little bit cheaper feeling and the spark does not have this led readout the mavic controller does have now without having actually used this yet I can tell you the LED readout is not super critical see because you always use these controllers with the phone the information presented on this led readout is redundant to the phone not entirely necessary I think they put it on the mavic because they intended for people to use the controller without a phone but who wants to you cant see the picture the layouts the same buttons are the same uh its got these great little X Wing Fighter arms here and thats where you stick and thats where you stick the phone now I do want to say as a very strong aside DJI made a lot of fuss about the fact that you can control these and theyre fully operational using just a phone you can also use hand controls things like that I think thats great whatever it feels a little bit like a gimmick to me I want to use a drone to take beautiful aerial cinematography whether its a tiny drone or a big drone and when you just have a phone youre trying to use essentially buttons that have this kind of tactile feedback youre trying to emulate that using nothing but a touchcreen its imprecise on top of it being harder to control because of the lack of buttons and this is a really big deal when youre using your phone its nothing more than the Wi Fi signal from your phone so the range is severely limited every time I used the spark using just my phone it was never able to get more than really like 70 or 80 ft away from me now in the Box here are these propeller guards they attach on something like this propeller guards are really great for two things thats if youre a total novice a total beginner they will protect your drone and two if youre flying indoors in really tight quarters theyll also be helpful there theyre not really for me though for the actual flight test Im going to go outside to a more open safe location but now Ive had this spark prototype for a few months one aspect of the spark thats sort of hard to capture in a review like this is how quiet and discreet it is even the mavic when you fire that thing up it does the it attracts a crowd and then it and its loud but the spark is quiet and small and somewhat innocuous people see it as a toy instead of a a my single favorite feature of the spark and this may seem silly but this is a big deal for me is the fact that you can just plug a micro USB cable into the spark itself and charge the battery portable battery charger plug it in this things charging right now thats a big deal it can be charging in my backpack all right so this is me setting up the controller for the DJI spark for the first time you have to go into your phone and like literally connect to the Wi Fi it doesnt say the pass know the password to the Wi Fi Wi Fi password is located under the sticker that okay I think Ive got it just so you know that took me 20 minutes to figure out that whole setup process was confusing and frustrating and took a long time but Im hoping maybe thats just because it was the first time that I did it now it is time for the long awaited flight test now what Im going to try and do is do some complicated but beautiful cinematography with the Drone and and then try to replicate that cinematography with the mavic compare the two shot its so cute Music d Music this looks really good Music all right I do have to say responsive responsiveness feels fantastic uh the image preview quality that you get on the screen right here is dynamite my complaints about radio versus wi fi are unfounded its really really good and the Drone is way the hell out there one of the biggest Tech teal hurdles of the spark versus the Phantom or any of the other DJI drones is that this only shoots in 1080 thats the highest resolution the mavic is shooting natively in 4k now if youre watching this back on a cell phone you might not be able to tell but if you watch it back in 4k on a big monitor youll be able to see the difference and its its significant Music ah okay despite all my bitching about that Wi Fi nonsense that was pretty incredible I took it way further than I had expected the image quality on this thing was amazing and Music uh all right so in conclusion biggest concerns with this were around its like flyability how easy is it to control in the air cuz on the phone it kind of sucks using the controller its perfect its Ace its everything I wanted its incredible controls are tight theyre theyre specific its responsive it does exactly what you want it to do it just kind of leaves one big question which is the million doll or 300 question which is for 699 for the whole package do you get this or for 999 do you get the whole package of the mavic and I think its if youre a novice if youre new to drones this is the way to go save the money and this things amazing if if youve had any experience or you have bigger aspirations for what you can do with the Drone spend the extra money get the mavic you wont have any regrets both though are great options for drones and I will never stop being impressed at just how tiny this thing is Music,123.67164179104478,cinematography,0.0,1.0,KwfD6Ybb5SU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfD6Ybb5SU
CNN Update,2017-07-05T11:33:04Z,15.65,2651937,96288,Music people keep asking whats up with my CNN thing so I thought Id make a quick video explaining whats up with my CNN Music thing I want to start with a little bit of historical context you know to shape the story out Applause Music all right the CNN thing this is a a brief history so in early 2015 I founded a technology company called beam uh with Matt hackit he was my partner then at the end of March that year I launched the Vlog the purpose of the Vlog initially was just to talk about me starting a new company and then it spiraled into something bigger and then Summer 2015 mid June we publicly launched beam the app a video sharing app like Snapchat or Instagram or something like that and largely driven by the popularity of the Vlog and I think people like the idea of beam downloads skyrocketed the app did really really well through summer and then slowly falling falling and not recovering we had a good app we had a great idea but Snapchat was better and Instagram was a better idea we got our asses kicked then comes summer 2016 uh not and I were trying to figure fig out the future of the company was CNN bought beam now a lot of people ask why would CNN buy a a failed video sharing app well they didnt buy the app they bought the technology company that was behind that app see there theres a tremendous amount of value in in pulling together a team and and building a company and the infrastructure and the IP that we create theres a lot of value behind that one app and thats what CNN was interested in they were also interested in me because of what I done on the Vlog now one very important distinction and Ive said before but a very important distinction CNN did not buy and does not own in any capacity this YouTube channel my YouTube channel that was not part of the deal Ill always continue to post whatever the hell I want to post on this channel beam CNN separate entity all right and thats the history portion of this video whats beam up to Music now so we that is me and Matt and our new partners from CNN spent the first part of this year kind of defining what it is we wanted to do and we knew we wanted to continue in technology we knew we wanted to introduce more media that is like videos and movies and YouTube and and we wanted to build something completely new the old beam that app that we killed has nothing to do with the new company but we still have the same people the same team weve actually been hiring quite a bit our team now is well its huge Music something thats super important to understand is that CNN owns beam but we operate separately so CNNs in this gigantic Glass Tower in Midtown and we work out of an old    up former furniture store in Chinatown CNN has like a gazillion employees and they wear suits and stuff like that we we work in a basement in Chinatown um so we really do operate on our own and thats not to say if we start screwing up that CNN might not step in but so far we still run this company like a startup we want to make all kinds of shows all kinds of content we want to release a lot of it here on YouTube but were also not against like trying other platforms newer platforms but were starting here on YouTube Just parenthetically we havent launched the YouTube channel yet I Ill let you know but theres no were not up yet the first show we want to launch uh were calling beam news and we want it to be like itll probably be 4 days a week when we launch it we want to get it to 7 days a week Im going to host it a little bit and then were going to have other people host it it has to be bigger than me to succeed and I dont want it to be the Casey show we had like a really smart team of journalists and researchers and writers helping us make that show well never be like a regular journalist hosting it itll be probably somebody like me or a YouTuber like Jake Jake who youve met before Jake is our head of production its a nice sounding title uh but Im alone and I feel head of production feel alone where where are you going no please and hes like really leading the charge on the media stuff including The Daily Show Now editorial I know theres a lot of questions behind editorial editorial meaning like you know what are our political leanings and whats going to be the content of the show this show is not going to be a politically motivated show were not going to be trying to convince anyone to do anything in this show politically in fact politics will make up at most a tiny tiny piece of this show and thats challenging were fighting against the baggage that comes with CNN a lot of people like CNN for certain reason a lot of people hate CNN for certain reasons and then we have to sort of push back against my own baggage I will be voting for Hillary yes that was a little heavy handed I realized that you know let me take a second and explain my own political position and again my politics have as little role in this show in my hosting of it as humanly possible but it is important for me to share with you where I stand politically so well you can watch the content through that lens now besides like a lot of folks on Reddit and whoever else labeling me like a a snowflake uh a liberal snowflake libtard I think is the the title actually I I personally identify with a lot of conservative values I identify with some liberal values and and a lot of libertarian values Im Im scattered and I certain dont subscribe to anyone political label I do subscribe to a set of morals and a set of principles and when I look to politicians who I like who I dont like I typically like the ones that are rooted in principles and values more so than a a political party or affiliations or things like that I know I was very heavy handed in the last presidential campaign but look I I hated the 2016 presidential campaign we had two candidates neither of which I like one of which I dislike more than the other one that I dislike I dont love whats going on in Washington thats both sides of the aisle I have huge issues with with politics and the United States of America as a whole and thats where I stand politically um I dont even know if thats appropriate for to be in this video but I I think theres a lot of misconceptions about who I am and where I stand politically so I wanted to share that with you beam news will not be politically focused politics are only going to play a a tiny if any role in that show itself instead its a its a daily news show about the things that interest us that is the team thats making it and where we are with the show now were actually we are producing it were making a show right now and we make something we look at it internally and were like what sucks about this and we try to correct that and right now I say the show is good we want to get it to very good and when its very good were going to launch it publicly and then someday we want to make it great very good is good enough to put it out there and then we want to hear back from people and and and ultimately together make it great and that when I think of like my Vlog I think the first episode kind of sucked but Music like look beam identity designs so thats this isnt final but like thats what were thinking for fonts and like beam news beam panels beam docks beam Productions like the different things that were going to do under beam and those are like slightly different fonts this was an earlier version of the logo this logo I like but and then we landed on this I dont think that this is finalized either but this is the idea I hope you think thats cool Im very very excited about that design I think it feels fresh and smart and also like a little bit nostalgic like kind of weirdo 1980s local news but in all the right ways this is going to be the first time anyones look how tan I am this is the first time anyones seen any of beam news actual beam news this is just a test this is not for public on beam news what do they need to know uh okay well Jake Host this bit not me yeah I hosted it um Casey is very tan I did look at the screen its we tried to talk about we found this interesting story that we liked about click farms uh and thats basically the the thing that instigates the whole entire piece is Click Farms how easy it is to get clicks but this is a good this is a good sort of teaser to show you a little bit of like the things that were interested in by we I mean the whole teams interested in its not politics its not the news that your parents watch or whatever this is like but it is news its news but its more of an experience I think is what were trying to go for anything else no okay here comes the first ever taste of a little bit of what beam news might Here It Go something that I found to be particularly interesting happened on Monday and that is that police in Thailand raided a click farm and weve heard about click Farms before especially on platforms like YouTube but in case you havent they are places that sell social media likes follows and views to companies or individuals who want to boost their online popularity that click Farm in Thailand like other click farms in India Bangladesh and elsewhere have these janky looking racks filled with hundreds of cell phones workers then rotate hundreds of thousands of SIM cards through these phones to make it look like different users were liking or viewing or friending or whatever it is that people do now lets be clear to me this is a form of of cheating and a lot of platforms and online stores prohibit stuff like this in their terms of service and they might even kick you off their site or delete your fake followers and Views and likes and reviews if you do business with a click farmer other fake users but its also legal the three guys who were arrested in that Thailand raid werent arrested for running a click Farm according to the AP they were actually arrested on charges that included not paying taxes on those hundreds of cell phones and we wanted to figure out just how easy this is spoiler alert its actually pretty easy for example there are vending machines in Russia where you can buy Instagram likes as if they were skill so all of this gave us an idea to try two things one lets actually buy some fake Instagram followers and two what if we did it for one of the people working upstairs at the beam office and then we just didnt tell them about it hey Jack so who should we buy some Instagram followers for Steve all right so it was pretty easy we found this website and we have a few options for how many followers we should get what do you think we should go with 100 5 000 I like that its quality followers yeah the best only the best the best for Steve all right we can do 999 because we have CNN Money oh there he is wow yep thats his profile so I got we have a plan while I do this you go upstairs and see if we can capture the moment when it happens yeah go for it all right Im going to walk up and try and not have Steve see me doing this but its going to be kind of obvious I think whats up fam yeah what are you recording for strike a post okay so were paying now see what happens okay we did it we paid 3999 hows everything going have the real answer or the camera answer you whispering to the camera Im very aware that Im on tape now Instagram likes happens in 5 minutes so were going to do that as well just in just in case I just ticked up for 265 dude I got two likes and a comment so now lets just refresh his thing and see when it takes place if this works Im going to freak out yes its happening hes at 53 likes right now 77 likes 86 you know its at 905 951 I feel really bad for him and his notifications dude youre kind of blowing up right now on IG what did you do why do I have 2 000 likes on my photo wait what no thats somewhere in the realm of 200 times more fuel my photos than regular so now were going to talk a little bit philosophically this isnt the news anymore but what I find especially from living in social media I mean my career was made off of social media is that its an extension of ourselves to a degree its its allowing us to share these moments of our lives with others and we want people to appreciate them is that in the form of a like or a view probably yes and so there is some meaningfulness to that all right that is the news Im Jake this was beam news uh and remember to smash that like button because its the only thing that makes me feel valuable or important in this life and hey guess what follow me on Instagram Twitter Facebook Snapchat I would say beam but that apps Dead all right see you later hes at 3 000 likes now wow thats awesome did you did you buy me followers too I didnt buy man I I really cant deal with having to clean that up okay that was perfect yeah that was great and youll get me that file as quickly as possible mhm we hope to launch that show soon in like you know weeks maybe a month something like that like I said were making it now its just not ready yet the second show that Im anxious to do is an investigative reporting show like a once a week show where we like dive really deep into one issue and pull that apart and after that like Id love to do something thats Sports focused maybe with live Id love to do something that is music or fashion focused thats more cultural but thats the scope of the ambition on the media side like its its this is not talking head news we want to really broaden our scope in what were doing and we want all the content to be very like YouTube Centric so I hope that helps give you a better understanding of of what were doing what Ive been focusing a lot of my time on and and maybe even get you a little bit theres the sun its like impossible to have even lighting here and I I will of course say this like I think a lot of people have concerns that CNN the company might be heavy handed in what were doing I think a lot of people have concerns that what were doing is going to be like crazy liberal    I I think people have concerns that like its not going to be me and when I dont understand something Im immediately skeptical of it so I would expect that of you about this new thing that I havent done a good job explaining yet but I say this whether you are suspect of CNN suspect of of news or a new thing or whatever heres my ask just check it out when we launch if you think its    call us out and tell us why its    if you think its really    just never watch it again but if you like it like let let us know let me know and let us know why and thats the thats the very best I can do if if it is garbage and you dont like it totally cool unsubscribe never watch it again stop watching me but I think that we are doing something interesting and something new we got awesome people working on it and I hope that were able to turn something out that youre pumped for okay beam coming soon Music oh

contamination there you things in life that require the precision that is riding a boosted board through New York City while dragging soul Music can I take a selfie with you I got to talk about something kind of serious for a minute if youre not into serious right now I understand just skip to here where Ill be back to my normal jovial self in this normal jovial vlog something happen yes you have really been like struggling with and its not the kind of thing that I want to talk to like my wife or my friends about it its something that it only makes sense in my head to talk to you about thats weird and I acknowledge that theres this nonprofit organization here in the states called Make A Wish and what make a wish does is that it it works with young people children and young kids who are terminally ill that means that they have an illness that will most likely take their life and make a wish grants them whatever wish in the whole world they want now Ive been in touch with make a wish for a while theyre incredible people and it turns out that theres a couple of young people and their wish is to meet me which is amazing and huge one of those people I hope to introduce you to and Im very excited to meet in August and then I had another young man that I was scheduled to meet in September hes the person I want to talk to you about so yesterday I got an email from make a wish and it was to let me know that that our get together in September was cancelled because he he passed away yesterday Ive never met this young man I dont know him I dont know what hes into I dont know his hobbies are no his interests are I dont hes like I was really excited to meet it but but I know the name and I know that he was given the opportunity to make one wish for anything in the world that he wanted in his his you get up one wish and his wish was to meet me and I dont know the bigger honor it if thats a huge deal in any event maybe his family will see this video and to them I wanted to say thank you because even though I never met this young man this whole experience is like really given me of a super hard reset on appreciating life and like forcing me to like to look around and realize that like all of the in life that feels like such a big deal whether its like work or relationships or the bad comments on YouTube or somebody calling you stupid or making fun of your a lot of that matters its like theres all this garbage and noise and in in life and times you have to ignore this and just realize that how special this is so thats it I needed to say that to the camera we now return to my normal blog we here is sorry someones gonna have you on the wrong block Im going to a heliport by the top speed sequence Music alright thank you sir can you pop the trunk

Candice's REACTION TO THE FRANCE MOVIE,2017-07-01T17:00:04Z,11.35,2352088,67244,I think my parents are ready today I mean they should be ready today thank you very much see when I dropped the pants off Eric told me that today would be the day that the repairs are done that can pick them up so Im just waiting to hear from him but Im pretty sure todays the day that the pants are ready this term this term called planned obsolescence and in the most simple terms what that means is when something thats designed or actually built to replace like something that is designed to be replaced for example when cars first came out way back in the day these things were bomb proof they could be fixed they could be repaired they lasted forever then when everybody who kind of wanted a car had a car if the car industry needed to create a reason people to buy new cars so they started designing them differently and promote artificial reasons for people to replace what they already have planned obsolescence now we live in a disposable culture where everything you buy is meant to be used up and then thrown away and then bought again thats not always a bad thing for example it makes things less expensive cars now theyre all made out of plastic and theyre not meant to last 3040 years but theyre safer theyre cheaper theyre lighter theyre easier to produce thats it Im not a plan of disposability I like to fix things I like to build things part of the reason why boosted board so much my biggest beef with the boosted board is how damn expensive ridiculously astronomically expensive these electric skateboards are when I give Sanjay the CEO for our expensive these things are his response is always the same these things are designed and built to be repaired and fixed and a lot of the cost of those repairs are built into the cost of the skateboards and I will say Ive had to send mine back a bunch of time theyre all like modular part engine can be replayed all can be replayed wheels come off that can be replace the fantastic battery can be replaced everything on this is built to be replaced and fixed this is not a disposable object so I like it this studio is a testament to my love or affinity for repairing instead of replacing or building instead of buying like this is this plumbing pipe implied with all healthy other wood screws as a little tool area just so I can build out and fix and repair this studio space by myself instead of throwing away crappy furniture and replacing it with equally crappy furniture I like to make things I like to fix things so why the diatribe about planned obsolescence okay my whats up my favorite pair of jeans from my favorite jeans store completely fell apart on me so I just beat the SH out of them and I sent them back and he fix them and not only doctor like fixing his products as part of his business and I love that did the CMS does Araki ones teen shop Im doing a whole like thing about planned obsolescence and why I like to fix things instead of replace things so my question for you is why do you bought why do you fix teens instead of just encouraging people to buy new ones we do both you got to be booked but when you fall in love with your jeans or your favorite your favorite thing in life and they tell story all your jeans tell a great story you dont wanna give up so quick so we fix who these those are God used to work here you know these is just an art piece now thats an option to display Wow all right where my pants at all holes are Pat how did you across filming cities are my favorite pant these are my favorite pants they completely sort of disintegrated budgets beat on them so much when layoffs which were here to experience aw but this is not like a paid advertisement or anything Erics just an old friend and Im just a dissipating the whole operation okay I forgot that part of the story the reason why we initially met I made a video about this but I was hit on my motorcycle the ambulance cut the pants off of me I sent him to shredded up pants it was sent me a new pair thats how friendships are born so we saw that I was like you in 2007 the book amazing all right you not a paid advertisement just a friend but if you find yourself in New York Citys SoHo come visit gene shop thats named the place gene shop across the street awesome people know these are my favorite 13 but

talked I know Im Way behind in these vlogs but I hope you havent given up on me I havent quit I havent stopped blogging I just needed a couple of days Thank You inspector I started this town I started this season of the blog I made a deal with myself that when when like my real life not live long life but like my life outside of uploading videos got to chaotic now just like hit the pause button on uploading videos and prioritize my life and thats what the last like 10 15 days have had been for me it all kind of started when Candace and I got in this big fight it was like a major fight then I like was uncomfortable uploading the videos that Candace and I made together before the fight is so weird so I was like you know Im just not going to think about that when we prioritize fixing this marriage crisis and then everythings cool with Candace and me I mean that totally cool and then like immediately after like settling that situation I started to travel and travel is always great for making vlogs and thats how I was able to make the Lufthansa first class airplane tea review yesterday featuring Wesley Snipes oh god their work being this good how cool is that that he cameoed in my vlog but I was in Germany for a minute and then we went to France I did attempt to vlog in France before that vlogging effort got totally derailed from there to VidCon and I was so psyched to vlog at big time not to sound cynical then I got to VidCon and I looked around and it was like I looked around at VidCon and it was just like literally thousands of craters all walking around like this talking to their camera which I love because it means blogging is huge but at the same time it sort of was like I was like you know Ive never experienced VidCon so Ive always been focused on that just like everybody else focused on making the best VidCon video I want a few of big Johns like like through my own eyes and set it through a camera and that made it special and then that brings us to

GOT A HUGE NEW TATTOO,2017-06-12T20:30:32Z,10.583333333333334,2467351,79295,Music okay thats it needle is in the arm does this hurt you as much as it hurts me Roger no Oh Music you Music Applause so youve seen youve seen that footage before Ive talked about Ive talked about in this vlog a number of times when I went to Afghanistan as a journalist I went there with my friend Scott Campbell whos this fantastic tattoo artist and he and I we linked up with these special forces guys these US Air Force pararescue jumpers and we set up a tattoo parlor in the middle of the warzone now theres one soldier in particular named Roger youve seen him on this vlog before and when we were there we tattooed Roger and he was the most kind of emotional about the process he himself when he got back he started tattooing he started giving people tattoos and hes now a pretty successful tattoo artist soldier we met in the war zone gave a tattoo to it was such an emotional experience for him that he is now a tattoo artist Music a lot of heat   thank you I go on the Brooklyn thats a surprise man if you have a good weekend morrow they said you promised to teach Rosa Blasi Im going to keep you out of love Marlon you can count on me Music so this year this is saved tattoo this is Scott Campbell the guy that I was in Afghanistan with the tattoo artists this is his tattoo shop and hes not here but look at this guy welcome please its good the reader you look like a tattoo artist today what is new uh oh yeah yeah Michelle did that the last night is meant for you Roger youre running out of canvas I am the chart spot Music the players Music now drive play that play yes we want to go yeah but you know just kind of treatment really do see because if you do this familiars this is Roger start that tattoo artists not Roger the soldier and what he and I are doing to sort of merging our experience together as human beings in Afghanistan and then now our strains together as artists is that fair oh yeah yeah its very articulate I mean its emotional for me to sit here and think about tattooing you because it wasnt for you and Scott and whatever you want to call serendipity in life I wouldnt be here doing this for you you know meeting you guys in Afghanistan like we did is what Im hearing Music punishing and Music its just unreal man the timing you know how things work out you know Im not a religious guy but I feel like Im a very spiritual guy and Ive been in the military the special operations for like 20 years and just the timing and the way this is all worked out is a pretty phenomenal it Music its its really heavy stuff I mean maybe I was just at a point in my career to where needing you guys affected me the way that it did but it definitely I was open to the change in the the risk of dive and ends so in any of that long very long Rodgers tattooing me here Music understand what does said you were kind of talking about traditional spot for something a date time stamp would be on the ridge Ive waited that symmetrical Music see Ive always wanted Roger to tattoo me and Ive always waited to the right excuse I dont really care what the tattoo is my feeling on tattoos in general is is its what they represent more than a sort of artistry thats why all mine are just really terrible lines its a pretty special experience for for me I hope for him too you know whats really interesting about that sometimes you can be what are we saving ourselves for you know Roger shaving me down tattooing it was kind of awkward to shame another man but its given us used to doll not that good or bad I mean I mean its obviously a good thing now you just initiate my army nor shave my whole body ah we need a privacy screen Im more than happy to shave your whole body all right on my wife beater on Im going to go ahead and get comfortable here now the idea was for Roger to do a small tattoo on me but we just kept making it ten percent bigger and ten percent bigger and ten percent figure were going pretty big okay thats it needle is in the arm Music beautifully I cant were having a great time its uh you know weve got to see each other over the years but I dont think anything really is intimate well I guess there are other things but this is very identified as were gonna get and so Im enjoying to be able to give back and do something personal for you with all the things youve done for me Music they could mean nothing or they can mean everything but whats really interesting is its bringing something very intangible tangible if not just for the ritual of it but for what youre gonna be left with you know for the rest of your long were almost done were done rods where are we the gun stop were on the just clean up a little bit because its what you do what I like it Im Casey Casey all right a little bit of Ross I like yeah I cant be here Im gonna clean up speech and all I asked for Roger before he started the tattoo was to kind of do what he wanted to do Roger Im wondering if you can explain to the audience what this is and what it means you know with my long military career I guess you know Ive always been very drawn to samurai culture and one of the things that the samurai would adorn themselves with were paintings within samurai culture they knew they would never have this proper burial and so they wanted to kind of like celebrate the beauty of their life while being alive and so they would adorn themselves in peonies and just kind of botanicals and so this is a peony that I drew up this uh Ive tattooed on people just the dearest human beings in my life it means a lot to me to be able to put it on you and Ive actually got it tattooed on me this is an outline as well so just to be cool and I didnt want any shading or any color I just wanted to line yep through there thanks Roger yeah oh man yeah this is so the one request I did have from Rogers that he had to sign it he had to sign my tattoo and this is it thats the peony in the master signature and thats the peony and then thats the signature youre stuck with me forever now Roger gladly like Im in a couple of other movies about my tattoos and how I feel about tattoos and the basic premise of those videos is that tattoos for me are about making permanent a moment or an experience in your life thats why like half of my tattoos are literally just dates or notes so I want to remember something and for the rest of my life but I see that mark on my body I want to think of that moment and this gigantic awesome samurai peony that Roger just gave me really represents like you know Rogers one of the most extraordinary human beings ever met in my entire life in the experience of knowing him the circumstances with which we met its a delicate art of my life and who I am and thats what this is about all right Roger I want to thank you again you are a brilliant artist sir

HOW TO VLOG LIKE CASEY NEISTAT by CASEY NEISTAT,2017-06-08T18:36:14Z,14.15,5794808,186261,Music C hey little sister tears what is up with this weather June 6th summer should be here already nothing just the same cold rainy    every day these guys are good Music though nice work thank you man if youre a if youre a regular viewer of this show you know just how much my happiness and good mood and just general positivity is tied to the weather youd also know that all winter long Ive been waiting for summer Music Music Music Im trying to illustrate a point here which is that it Reigns a disproportionate amount of days in New York City but as Im making charts and then looking at the data Im realizing it rains on average 11 to 15 of the days kind of making me feel like a little bit of a beat for complaining about it so much maybe I should have looked this up before I did this whole scene so with it pouring rain outside with it pouring rain outside today seems like an opportune day to make a video Ive wanted to make for a very long time called I wanted to explain to you the audience exactly how I make my Vlogs like what I see as the recipe for creating these videos first a quick history lesson I started vlogging in March of 2015 now before I started vlogging vlogging was typically individuals carrying around like point and shoot cameras that were sort of documenting their day into a camera it was a much smaller genre back then and it was pretty linear day begins here day ends there come with me throughout my day I found the genre fascinating I was obsessed with like Ben Brown I was obsessed with fun for Louie I was obsessed with BF for versus GF Charles Trippy was great I think what fascinated me the most about the whole genre was the idea of using your your life as a narrative for a daily series now when I made my HBO series this is a series I did with my big brother van it was on HBO in 2010 we made it in 2008 thats 10 years ago my brother and I used our lives as a backdrop for a TV show but it wasnt so daily it wasnt so episodic instead we kind of plucked interestingness out of our Lives shared that interestingness as tiny little stories strung those stories together and called that a TV show episode so on one end of the spectrum weve got your daily vloggers in 2014 2015 sharing every aspect of their daily lives into a camera and on the other end of the spectrum we got this TV show that I made a decade ago where I share little stories from my lives as short movies so I went to Belgium in 2015 this is a month before I started vlogging and I wanted to test out one thing what would happen if I sort of vlogged about my trip but instead of talking into a camera I used really precise cinematography what would happen movie like cinematography but it was just me going about my daily life going into my hotel room coming out of my hotel Music Music room and I love that video that video worked you should watch it its linked below and that got me super excited and thats when I made the decision that on on my birthday 2015 I would start daily vlogging it wouldnt be this all day long instead I wanted to figure out how to make something that felt a lot more like a movie every day so that was the thinking thats what went through my head prior to starting to Vlog so with that understanding here are the foundational principles that I apply to almost every episode of of this daily almost daily Vlog number one the most important thing is of course the story but what is the story heres a super basic breakdown of a story and every good story follows this rule that is the rule of a threea narrative youve got a beginning youve got a middle youve got an end setup conflict resolution Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pill of Water Act One Jack fell down and broke his crown act two Jill came tumbling after act three setup conflict resolution now in some episodes thats super super super literal for example my all time favorite episode that Ive ever made of this Vlog which is called my all time greatest is such a literal example of setup conflict resolution it just felt so good to make that theres a setup heres what happened there was a conflict oh my God whats the outcome going to be and then there was a resolution happy ending thats not always so literal in every episode but I strive for that in every episode because that is whats at the core of a well  told story and a story is what drives any video like this and that right there was sort of the promise or the deal that I made with myself was never an obligation to share with you the intimacies of every day of my life this isnt a journal but instead could I find every day in my life a three act narrative to share now a couple of the more granular aspects I always found it kind of hard to watch non stop shaky camera Vlogs it was disorienting it was always a little claustrophobic so so what I try to do is have an equal amount of handheld locked off shots locked off means on a tripod like this and then establishing shot the wide shots those establishing shots let you know where I am so it feels more like youre here with me these locked off shots let you the viewer forget about the camera for a second and focus on what Im saying and the environment that Im in and then the handheld shots like this enable you to sort of feel the spontaneity and the urgency that is whatever is taking place in my daily life Hardware as in what cameras I use I have a simple rule for when it comes to hardware and that is always use the very best camera you have at your disposal so right now Im shooting this on my big camera Im shooting in 4k with a nice wide lens this is a perfect shot Ive got a light right there Im trying to make myself look good this is the best I have right now but when Im out running in the morning and I want to film my runs the best I have is my cell phone I keep a point and shoot in my backpack in case I dont have this big camera because the point shoot is a little bit more Dynamic than just the cell phone so Im not beholden to any certain kind of Hardware or any certain quality of Hardware its what I have access to cinematography part two hold the camera steady no one wants to watch super shaky cinematography it hurts your brain its hard to see whats going on its not pleasurable for for you the viewer and its not easy for me the editor to put it together if its super shaky if its nonsensical it goes straight in the trash whats up Marlin I almost ched your pockets man Im making a movie Marlin about how to make how I make my Vlogs really yeah like its not so much a tutorial but its a little bit of like I dont know ask of it Ive never really shared right so you know what you should have done you should have S sat with me and um taught you sit with me and and teach me how to do it okay the next version of Casey ni stats vlogging Secrets will be with Marlin where going I teach him how to Vlog cinematography part three time lapses and and drones heres something very important no one gives a    about your stupid time lapses your stupid drone shots thats something I have to remind myself on a daily basis that kind of cinematography only works if its serving a greater purpose and for me it serves two purposes one is Transitional so youll notice sometimes like Im outside wrapping up a scene where Im doing something on my skateboard the next scene Im in my studio doing something completely different and in between there might be a a beautiful drone shot of the city or might be a beautiful time lapse of the city Im using it to get me from one scene or one aspect of the story to the next as that its an incredibly effective tool the other place where it works is to show the audience a broader sort of a broader image of where you are and whats taking place in time drones in particular are great for that Im at a hotel on a cool beach and it doesnt really work pointing my camera the Drone can give you context that otherwise Music Applause couldnt if that kind of ambitious beautiful cinematography doesnt have a relationship with the narrative even if its just a little relationship it feels out of place and it gets boring very very fast now there is a lot more depth and complexity to it than that things like where does being positive all the time start to just sound like total BS where people dont believe it things like when Im feeling down and I want to share with you the audience and Im struggling with something how do I do that in a way that you actually care cuz weve all got our own problems why should I give a sh about yours things like consistent narratives and you know if Im on a trip thats 5 days long how do I make a 5day episode Arc about essentially the same subject so theres a lot of depth to this but I hope that this serves as a good sort of introdu into some of the thinking that Ive had as I do this Vlog I want to end this first kind of instructional sharing video by saying this probably the most important thing to succeeding whether its in the Vlog game the YouTube game or in the creative space at all is this you have to have your own thing so if you follow this video perfectly and you make the most perfect Casey Vlogs you will have failed before youve begun they dont want to see your Casey Vlogs they want to see your your Vlogs they want to see what you can bring to the table my favorite thing in the world is seeing how YouTubers are able ble to iterate and build on other YouTubers Styles and sentiments and ideas until they make something thats uniquely theirs those are the YouTubers that really succeed so the most important rule is be original and that whole recipe that I just outlined that was what I thought I could uniquely bring to YouTube and help find success with it all right please let me know below if this is super interesting or absolutely fing Bor see Im outside now this is the beginning of act three sorry if you remember but it all so unnecessary I dont know if you remember but in all the episodes where I talk about having gone to Afghanistan as a journalist and connecting with these par rescue jumpers there was one guy that I met whos been in this Vlog before named Roger Sparks oh okay thats Casey thats me thats Roger right there thats the man thats the PJ and there he is again thats Roger there this is an awesome plaque that that these guys made for me amazing guys Roger was a part of this amazing campaign to restore coral reefs they made a big movie about it thats the movie screening Im going to tonight looks incredible going to show the support and to see this great movie Music is it the right place whats up man how you doing oh awesome Ro how you doing so you guys might remember Roger here this is Rogers big movie this is your big movie watch how humble he is its not a movie about me its about a cause about uh helping Special Operations veterans and helping the ocean most humble man on planet Earth its wonderful to see you Roger congratulations oh thank Applause you movie is about to Music start the ocean is really the Last Frontier um surreal combat that uh cant cannot really be articulated his extraordinary efforts under direct immediate danger to his own life resulted in Saving four American lives one host nation civilian and returning Four soldiers killed in action to their Applause families fantastic that movie was about taking former soldiers bringing them to help repair coral reefs by like scuba diving and that being therapy for the soldiers and then also a way to start to repair the damaged environment so its like helping the Earth and helping these former soldiers incredible story incredible story Roger is also an incredible guy all Im

comparing Music Hardware before I go outside for some practical tests of these boards I just want to go over some of the technical specifications looking at their websites theyre super super similar so the juice board says it goes 20 mph boosted board says it goes 22 mph this thing says it has a 7 m range boosted says it has a 6 to 7 mile range regenerative braking dual motors regenerative breaking dual motors honestly even the juice website looks like the boosted Board website but from like a side by side spec analysis they seem to be very or at least advertised as very very similar I did want to do a flex Music test all right this is the flex test on the 1 500 boosted board 100 bamboo deck look at that Flex good flex and this is the flex on the um its actually 449 is for the cheap one 599 is for the dual motor version of the juice so I I take back what I said this is a 599 board not a 499 board all right this is the flex test on the um bamboo and maple juice board its actually not that bad I mean it cant Flex as much it hits this battery and its it does feel more rigid but it flexes a lot more than I had expected it to so what Sam go outside now right yeah lets do it okay lets do it Im going to have Sam carry the extra board because well he offered to and youre cool with that right yeah its all right if youre wondering why were carrying the juice board its cuz like I want to ride it for the first time on camera and in New York City we got to make sure were somewhere we can like ride safely where theres not too many people were going to carry it to a safe less crowded part of the city test it there all right so now were deep deep on Manhattans West Side theres like some kind of thuggish looking dudes over there that are smoking pot Im not going to film them they look a little scary over here weve got the UPS fulfillment center this is a good place to test the boards those the guy smoking pot all right this is it this is the first powering up of the juice board great turned on fine no problem all right well Ill tell you this much its a lot A lot quieter than the boosted board start off with the speed test yeah acceleration test yeah uh very important detail here NYPD this is chalk it washes away with water this is not vandalism because this is temporary please dont show up my house or office or try to arrest me again okay thats going to be our starting line there Im on the juice board thats the boosted board ready yep 1 1 2 2 3 okay uh well this is the initial ride of the juice board and acceleration not great come Music on what that look like from your perspective I didnt even see you you were gone in half a second all right next test is going to be the highp speed the top speed test how do we even do this Im going to go as fast as I can Sams going to try and keep up now Im on the Juiced board Im on the cheap board the 449 board so thats been 10 seconds this is probably top speed come on man when it comes to top speed test again the um juice board was absolutely creamed by the boosted board now this next test this is going to be the breaking test how quickly they stop my chalk line which is right here which is washable chalk not vandalism remember that its not vandalism this chalk line right here were going to start all the way down there at that truck come full speed to the line here and then hit the brakes as soon as we hit this line and see how far past the line we go before we stop 3 2 1 go great all right so we did that test five times and quite frankly brakes on this arent that bad like boosted board definitely stopped so windy stop more aggressively and more effectively but its not like the acceleration test like I would say that stops in about 15 ft of less distance than this stops kind of amazing this kid just came up on a boosted board yo whats your name Casey hey how long have you been riding your boosted board I had it since day one try out this juice board just like take it up and down the street and let me know your honest thoughts compared to the boosted board all right cool all right so this is the uh unbiased stranger we met in the street whos a uh veteran boosted board Rider Music test I think that like whats the ni about the Boost Bo you can go on reverse this you cant really do that um anything I like getting on like those little edges when you turning the Boost is just like super smooth like this I feel like I kind of like went out of it like drifted a little bit the verdict here is that I would say that the boosted board is better but I would say its not a bad board its you dont think its bad no not at all okay thank you for your help yeah man no problem nice to meet you thank you sir I promise Sam Id buy him a smoothie if you help me with this video its a fair trade all right so the conclusion from the uh t in the real world is that its not as bad as I expected but its nowhere near as good as this but for 500 bucks youre getting a pretty good board this isnt garbage its not garbage I would not call it pretty good though in conclusion this thing works its fine I guess it is impressive that theyre able to do it for such a low price but just know one thing this is not a boosted board this is a cheap knockoff of a boosted board this this is a toy and if youre fine buying a toy then its a good value for a toy but its a little bit like wanting a high performance sports car like wanting a Ferrari boosted board being the Ferrari instead of getting a Ferrari you get a used old Hyundai used old Hyundai is fine might even get you from A to B but if you want a hyper if you want a Ferrari dont buy a Hyundai and then paint a dramatically similar logo to the Ferrari on the side and expect that cheap knock off to perform like a Music Ferrari also um I crashed my new spark drone into a tree and it fell 20 wait wait wait dont forget to subscribe to my channel youtubecom  samsher crashed onto the concrete and it didnt break thats youtubecom  samsher nice work

THIS IS WORTH $1 MILLION DOLLARS,2017-05-25T19:30:00Z,10.066666666666666,3278378,85283,I have a lot of fans in Japan yeah yeah should I have done this interview in Japanese Music Music thank you very much Music Music check out this framed picture of me heres another one but this is what my glasses and then its me and its a record this is remarkable such talent someone made this completely out of Legos theres work harder this is acrylic on wood really special really incredibly well done here but theres a holiday sweatshirt got my got my face on it this is a white sweater this is really cool look thats like all my electronics someone printed it onto a sweatshirt this is a super high quality of luminol skateboard and on that skateboard my face shirt that says my name on it jacket it says my name on it look at the back ego a persons sense of self esteem or self important narcissism excessive or erotic interest in oneself and one physical appearance alright I think to be an artist or a painter or a filmmaker creator of any type it means your ego is so big you think that the rest of the world cares about your perspective but even a youtuber who has such a big ego that he makes videos about his life every day because he thinks people care even my ego isnt big enough for all of these awesome paintings of me these are amazing works of art that people have made something but I cant put a picture of myself up and I cant wear a sweatshirt with my face on it Im just not comfortable with that so I had an idea Music today its hard to breathe with us on today and the other thing my nose is too big for this today in the USA is red nose day red nose day is a day where a whole bunch of money is raised and its raised to help underprivileged children and thats kids here in the USA in all 50 states and kids around the world who dont have what they need to live a happy and healthy and fulfilling life so heres an idea I linked below a Facebook fundraiser every dollar thats donated today before the end of the day on actually said the date wrong its every dollar donated today through June 15th 2017 every dollar thats donated will be doubled by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Im going to make a donation and heres the thing dont donate a dollar and what Im going to do is once the fundraiser is complete I will randomly contact people who have donated via Facebook to get in touch with them and see which of these artworks or t shirts or sculptures or skateboards or or little clay sculptures of me they might be interested in if youre not interested in any of this crazy KC paraphernalia which I would understand well then at least youre donating a dollar or some money the kids really need help I got to go now last year I wore it all day but it really is like my nose is too big for a red nose I gotta go dont late please be generous Music Harlan Harlan central island 431 man is an important quote there were 27 thousand runners over time so its good to talk

DJi SPARK vs DJi Mavic!!  EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS TINY DRONE,2017-05-24T15:46:21Z,8.05,4552971,98625,thats the DJI spark we got tiny it is look how tiny is also this is it this is the DJI spark I wish there the way I could show you just how small it is Music anything that doesnt do it justice you have to hold the senior hand it is fantastically small remember how small the Mavic was when you first saw it this thing is miniscule its tiny it is smaller than the old tiny iPhone this is my red jacket pocket phantom for spark look at this look at this could easily carry this around this is the 747 this is the space shuttle that flies on top of it all right now its time to get out of the studio and do an actual performance test of this early version of the spark there is one small problem with testing us though and that is that Im under investigation by the FAA and I cant fly in New York City anymore so I dont want to get in trouble and if youre responsible and you shouldnt do it either so I got to go somewhere where I can fly this thing safely boosted board is out of range Im going to need a better vehicle to get out of the city to shoot this video can I borrow swing do you have a car I can borrow that matches my jacket this one is that like the 458 Spyder has a slightly better reign is just a little bit quicker than the skateboard so Im headed out of the city now I just need Im going to go meet a friend who can help me with the tech aspect of this video review Music well mark it slowly with a deck review Im gonna help you out yeah all right lets go oh god I dont know how to lock okay Marquez just like everybody else on planet earth has never seen the tiny DJI spark before tiny like time you like Mavic is pretty matted thats smaller than your smallest cell phone that thats a bomb thats the smallest drone box thats an okay slide open Marcos right oh you did not lie did not why is that Wow all right some very important disclosures before I fly this thing for the first time number one this is not a paid review number two they were very specific this is a prototype this is not the final one the ones they ship is going to be more perfected than this number they dont actually have a controller ready yet so Im we can filling this with my cell phone and see this is not a complete review this is just a first look to see what this thing is like because this is unfinished to hardware and software lets fly it do it alright here we go take off oh why nothing is super super steady I mean its wobbling but the shock steady thats like saying foot you never get this close to any other drum Music the controls even just using a cell phone are really really responsive its just like flying a regular big Mavic or phantom but instead of having physical buttons youre using the touchscreen some other things it always use 1080 not 4k it has a two axis gimbal not a 3 axis gimbal which means it goes up down and it stabilizes the rotation axis got it like this but it doesnt do this right it doesnt turn brave man Im a trusting that its cable right yeah rock solid and theres a little bit of grief this is the scene in the test where Im going to be pitting the tiny spark again see slightly larger Mavic were going to use the Ferrari as the subject Music I think its early around five six hundred bucks its marketed for people to take tip photos of friends and stuff like that not like a hardcore little lesson of film tool but more of a fun tool exactly like its meant for people whove never own drum its unbelievably impressive Im not being paid to say that but I give it a fat thumbs up not being paid to say anything either but Ill have a more detailed comparison I yes and definitely is that a plug for your channel oh you should go check out go check out marques channel links alone thats it okay thats it but seriously DJ I thank you for continuing to push the boundaries of whats possible with drones this is insane sick yes lets go Music,96.27329192546583,fantastically,0.0,1.0,nujgBunvgBI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nujgBunvgBI

TINY CARBON FIBER HIGH POWERED ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD,2017-05-22T20:36:03Z,11.0,4817861,111494,I loved you call your brother I said hello Music good news bad news good news good news its another hot sweaty sticky balmy summer day here in New York City bad news cold front coming this afternoon good news that means they need to bring the red jacket backs of long No because either for everything well this morning in three minutes Candice and I have a parent teacher conference for Francine her first year of school is just about done and were going to go meet with the teachers to see how it went anything good I dont think theyre talking about our child because you so much better behaved that Bullivant is at home Horcruxes advanced shes in Britain back for others well just hear hold Jamess hand shes very pleased shes nothing like her mother bye honey brainiest Im thoughtful and empathetic were looking forward to Washington grow and exchanging jokes and riddles next year what a wonderful skin go ahead and work in this park today and instead of in the studio until I run out of battery because its a special day here Josie of all your vlog rates up artists in your care pet repairs monkeys in here thanks for the monkey shirt Sean greetings from the United States on camera Tyler thank you for sending me this letter and thank you for sending me this letter which I will open up off camera youre a very nice young man for doing that Applause teller thats not me KP asking you to do all of you that is uh theres not even a name in here Kelley whoever this guy is he seems very nice and extremely thoughtful but maybe a little forgetful because I dont know what his name is but you should go out with him portable and intelligent electric skateboard from SPECT you know before I open this skateboard one thank you for sending me wherever sent it to me too before you send me Electric skateboards I just want you to know how loyal I am to boost his board its not just because like Ive been there and theyre super nice to me if they make a fantastic product so this is the whole skateboard whoa whoa look a little it is read before first ride all right so I gather from when I read the manual have you stopped you dont have a controller its how you for that manual you dont have a controller its how you step on the skateboard that makes it go step on it this way you go forward you step on it anymore space Music Applause Applause a Ford model and electric better how to work here its supposed to be lies but its decided to fight my quote look at it in terms of my plug thats what I like about it so I want an electric skateboard that I can like bring on airplanes with me but I cant figure out how to get it to movie theres no controller going to your locker figure this out well I mean it says in here that if you step on it in a certain way its supposed to go and accelerate decelerate if you lean forward youre having about as much success as high end Marlon he says if you step on your front foot Hey howd you do that before the day of course of course Marlins gonna figure this thing out what did you do I dont know a good Nigel you look good I love it if you lean and after the sense the stand up straight and lean I dont think if your edges like that I think you got this book got a diploma like I think you have to be Marlon to ride this thing let me go all right Im not giving up Im going to read the manual here was just trying to figure out how to get my skateboard to work and I cant figure it out it was having problems man as you talk about the residuals over my gun right now I got 99 problems in my electric skateboard is one never burn it out Ive never got it okay from a concept perspective the idea that I could travel with an electric skateboard that according to your manual has an 11 mile range is incredibly enticing thats everything I want out of electric skateboard that Im not getting out of my boosted board so I do think theres a place for this little guy in the market its incredible it also feels well built and all that stuff with that though I am a man of moderate to average to medium intelligence and I read this twice Im also a lifelong skateboarder and a fairly competent guy when it comes to all things electronic I dont know what this means and then the last thing that Im going to    about is the app it seems like you have to be using the app to get the board to work okay maybe thats okay but I dont think thats okay secondly Im speaking from authority here I own a software development company you require all kinds of login credentials to ride my skateboard if youre making hardware dont demand a user name and password to ride a skateboard thats preposterous out of the box I just want to be able to ride this thing Im sure its expensive it seems like a lot of fun but it sends an hour on this I couldnt figure it out so Im going to end this review without actually riding this thing and my review so far is you got some work to do feel like such a jerk for not doing a positive review but I got to be on it PS this is not a paid endorsement are you the guy who sent me the inspector skateboard I have some questions for you all right well first of all when I open the box and I saw this thing Id never heard of it before and I dont know the last time I was so excited about a new toy okay so yes you address all of the shortcomings with the boosted boards is very challenging to travel with that big skateboard so I was really excited about the spectra but Im sitting here editing my video review of the spectra and its not I spent an hour and a half playing with your board and never figured out how to use it I couldnt make sense of your manual so the thing is were going to have tutorial video that could give you a really easy rundown on how to do it um but the app basically once you log in Facebook Twitter whatever you log in and then you have access to the remote I havent been this excited about aprox in a really long time Im going to try doing the acting and using the remote connection do we know as a typical board to have this little acceleration deceleration thing and then make up your mind hows that okay yeah my minds not made up the verdict is still out Im just frustrated and I wanted to share that frustration with you because Im really excited about this thing No Deal is enough honest review speed record definitely appreciated alright so hi Im seems like an awesome guy and like I said I want this thing to be successful I also want to be good so this is not a complete comprehensive review this is an incomplete unconfrontational Music okay everyone is asleep Im ready for the race tomorrow I have been before I am at five hours Im so bummed

SELLING DRUGS ON THE INTERNET,2017-05-17T17:03:50Z,7.3,1782581,62689,Laughter Music todays Vlog todays vlog Vlog is going to be a slow Vlog were going to kick things off with a new segment this new this new segment of the Vlog is going to be called Casey iats book club if Oprah had a book club then then I want to have a book club when I was growing up books were my friends when I didnt have friends I had books a book club is literally where I just talk about what books I like like and then maybe you read those books and then we can talk about them together thats a book club you see I dont think people read enough anymore and well I dont think thats a good thing reading is like its like leaving the house yes you can go your whole life without doing it but youre not really experiencing all life has to offer if you never leave the house books are the same so for this inaugural inaugural Casey I st book club the book Im going to feature is American Kingpin by Nick Bilton now I know Nick a little bit hes a very smart guy hes an excellent reporter I knew him when he was a reporter at the New York Times now he writes for Vanity Fair or something the thing about Nick is Nick wrote the book called hatching Twitter and Ive talked about this here on this show before because it was reading his book hatching Twitter which was about how twiter Twitter came to be that literally motivated me inspired me gave me the confidence to start my own technology company this is his new book and its about um its about the Silk Road which was a like drug uh website on the Deep Web that I didnt know about but apparently I was the exception a lot of people use silk road to buy an insane amount of drugs and guns and poison and human body parts and all kinds of stuff see the Silk Road was like a uh it like amazoncom but for cocaine and heroin and guns this book is about how this like 20 something year old nerd started this literally 1 billion drug and it at one point in time before this kid got busted this is all public like Im not spoil alerts like this happened in real life he was like he was trafficking more drugs on planet Earth than almost anybody else it made him like worth nearly 100 million it sold B billions of dollars worth of drugs thats what this is about this is a work of narrative non fiction meaning this is like a truthful story this is this is a completely true story its based on news reports FBI reports this guys personal Journal everything in here is factual but it reads like The Da Vinci Code it is unbelievably riveting it does that thing where at the end of every chapter it leaves you with just enough where youre like ah and you have to read the first paragraph of the next chapter and then before you know it is a downward spiral and you end up finishing this book which is took me 4 days to get through this and thats it for the first episode of the casy night book club I hope you enjoyed it Music oh clearly that guy didnt get the memo that today was a chill Vlog D hes taking his pants off so the reason why today is a chill a chill Vlog well one last night was Candaces party and we were out till like 100 in the morning so

they SENT ME 100 POUNDS OF RED GOO,2017-05-11T20:28:59Z,12.816666666666666,3453906,88069,so what is this with you in my own video or on video Music Im great how are you take your mom getting some free problem yeah they can hear free promo right here you got CeeLo that zombie gee thank you Music so packages keep showing up in my office as a result my office hes getting smaller and smaller just packages everywhere so today Im going to dedicate the whole show to opening all the packages now if its watching the open boxes for 10 famous doesnt sound interesting I understand come back tomorrow Ill have more of the regularly scheduled marginally more interesting programming that youve come to know and ladies in life Music so I have I have a dream that didnt come out right I have a watch something that I really wish I had that I dont think exists in the world I want to be able to take my cell phone plug it into any computer and have an icon show up on that computer I double click and the computer unlike a new computer interface opens up just running off of my cell phone on the computer I want that to work on my Samsung phones I want that to work on my on an iPhone does that make sense though so you dont need to travel with a computer you just travel with your cell phone you plug it into any computer and that computer then becomes your computer which you carry in your pocket I dont think this will ever exist because it would decimate the PC market that said this is a perfect segue to the first part of todays unboxing video which which is going to be about this apparatus that Samsung is also for what its worth I currently carry a black Galaxy s8 Im switching to a silver one because all I didnt know they made a silver one I think its better looking if youre a longtime viewer of this show you know that I always disclose when Im being paid to do something I am NOT being paid to make this video but I do work with Samsung and they put me in that commercial and if Im going to be totally honest with you I just tweeted a couple weeks ago that I was curious about this thing and next thing I know Kelsey you know Chelsea shes the girl everybody likes it sent me a keyboard a mouse the deck station in this ridiculous monitor so this is an absolutely bias review take everything I say with a grain of salt but uh okay lets just start it what this is supposed to be is a way to plug your well you plug well this apparatus here becomes the dock for your phone so you take this plug your phone in and then in the back here you can plug this into a monitor and a keyboard and then this is supposed to operate as a computer what we have here is your basic Logitech Bluetooth keyboard this is a bluetooth mouse calc yellow why you think I dont appreciate it this is a big enough monitor or what HDMI a lot of cable to power cable just like an evening just    like a woman   alright thanks for your tech support you turn it on ah power hey I changed screen resolution so now this whole computer system here is based on my phone how to pair aha thats the browser I have running these are all my apps oh youre a new TV video you add Jesse and Jeana oh shoot Applause okay so just to be clear this is what my phone playing on a monitor this is YouTube playing on a monitor off my phone control the computer and keyboard of Jesses new video all right Jesse I love you Im going to come watch Phoenix watching that later this is very very impressive so far Samsung alright so moment of truth here this is really important when it comes to this say I have all this setup at home I unplug it thats good thats how it should work except for now I cant access my phone it just said yeah now here we go ready I come home from work plug it in one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand see I just want to be able to plug it in have a boot up and go okay alright thats pretty its hard to say where this is super practical because you do have to have this and then you have to have all the cables and then you have to have wireless Bluetooth and keyboards its not as simple as that idea that I want where you just plug this into any computer when youre at a hotel youre at an airport or something like that you boot this up plug it in when all you have is this and it sort of acts as a computer alright I know that was a pretty abbreviated review but so far pretty impressed with this thing Samsung nicely done Music now there are a lot of packages here for mail time but Im going to go ahead and begin with the bigger packages because they take up the most space and I need my space back Oh a dry erase channel thank you whoever sent that to me just a quick we are redoing all the branding around beams so the old beam logo that looks like this

you Finnish people all right Casey yeah show me how its done boss check it out have the courage to turn yourself to the back otherwise its bad I know it feels a little scary but the best thing is to land on your back can you just climb down here and jump into those boxes like this Laughter Music hello oh yeah Im sorry I didnt know that Ill be right down oh I think Im supposed to be downstairs okay time to go today is my first day in Finland add a little bit of like a weird jet lag sort of blackout situation last night when I lay down and woke up 14 hours later I gotta I gotta pick up the pace Music I didnt mean to go up I I dont know how to use this elevator so after you dropped me off yesterday I went to sleep and then I woke up like an hour ago sorry I kept you waiting no problem so longer zoom lens these girls better let me close on running through the street no clothes can zoom into the 4k there this is like this is like a press thing Im these guys are all just firing questions at me about rapid fire right now okay what else was that it thats all the questions Music can I ask you a question yeah what are those are those hard to run in no no theyre very nice I think I live in higher but right now Im hi yes Im time I use so this talk this morning is phoom fest talk its sort of an industry talk its about like new media social media building online audience things like that love talking to these audience especially in like an international forum like this I dont know what the rest of the day holds Im hoping to go see a doctor because the whole skateboard fall yesterdays hasnt quite healed like I well still a lot of pain another that I dont know what to do I only have two days in Finland so I really want to take advantage but first I do my dog Music thats where Im going to be doing my talk Applause Music Applause Music Ill see you thank you Ill see you tomorrow in the morning how do you how do you think the talk button why it was really inspiring it was first time for me to hear your whole story great story Thanks I appreciate it I can bend it like this I can the motion feels fine Joe and I have feeling this sore yeah exactly did I do the right thing when I put it back really yeah because I wasnt sure it just looked horrible yeah it was completely sideways yeah and it went yeah so what do I do now just like there there if theres nothing usually we can do for that thank you Music I still dont know whats about to happen oh youre gonna love it no what are we doing Ive no idea lets find out I have no idea what were doing beautiful beautiful is there anything you want to say to the people like no I just have a question all right what are we doing yeah the idea is that were gonna have a cross court isnt there like a race car okay and your piece gonna be driving the car okay yeah a lot lucky you and I gonna be in it with you what kinda okay well youre not gonna be in it with me yeah the idea is that youre gonna be duct taped to the rules of the race card came up with this idea Music all right this is it there you know I tape me to the top of this car now duct tape and thats kind of crucial part of this whole like a strap or something you think duct tapes the best I think I think duct tape in this case its the best way to how fast youre gonna drive well as fast the 15 goes yeah Im really excited I dont know if you can tell they look on my face but yeah Im super super excited right I can tell from your eyes youre gonna be back ready by the way if you lean all over here I cant see it fine so this is the game and I cant really tell you to say if its too tight okay you need the blood circulation still thats probably a good idea also I think we need like before we go we need to make a test that like youre trying to get out yeah we go international Music ready to go Music Music dont stop for the roof this car for an hour now our intent    Im a little bit sore but I have a great time great time Music Music Music so what do I have for a recap its good the thing is like all those action scenes all those amazing shots is that was a lot of fun but its 720 right now and they strapped me on the roof of that thing at like 515 so its almost a little over two hours sitting on there and that really started to hurt my man parts hurt but it was a lot of fun Music Music so they just asked me that okay do you mind doing just one last fun thing with us one last fun thing with us before we break this party up are they sure so they want me to jump off this building right here onto a cardboard box dont know why but it seems I guess I

this PISSES ME OFF more than anything,2017-04-24T19:30:01Z,9.3,2453502,87164,Applause Music weekend tradition Starbucks with the kiddo the Hat the Hat was at her insistence Music so I was at this dinner last night and I ran into a friend of mine this woman there she told me that her son has been vlogging hes young that hes been vlogging and kids at school have been making fun of him because hes making YouTube videos and thats the thats the second time the second time Ive heard that from like a from a young person that TW I think he was 12 or 13 years old and he was making YouTube videos he also well his parents also told me that he was getting teas at school cuz he made YouTube videos God that just pisses me Music off I want to kick off todays episode with a message directly to you 12 year old kid whos getting teased at school because you make YouTube videos let me explain a truth bear with me here this is for everyone this is for everyone whos trying to do something that they believe in and some is discouraging them against okay ready this line here this line is you over here is now and here is when you succeed now theyre going to tease you now theyre going to tease you now because you dont have success just yet then youre going to succeed and theyll want to be you these are the two phases that will happen by the doubters and by the haters and in between theyre scared of you so when those kids at school are picking on you no its because theyre scared of you so they tease you cuz they know when you succeed theyre going to want to be you now you down here in between now and when you achieve success there there are two things two things that you should be doing and that is to persevere and be determined perseverance I will continue my Pursuit no matter the opposition you can tease me you can pick on me you can call me a loser you can be like my friends parents like back in high school when I had to drop out because I had a kid to take care of and they looked at me like I was a loser and they rolled their eyes at me and they didnt want their kids to hang out with me because I was the loser I didnt care I persevered I continued my Pursuit determination I will stop at nothing to achieve my goal you are determined and you will stop at nothing so to the kids in school are picking on the kids that want to make YouTube videos teasing somebody for doing something that theyre passionate about how dare you God get me all riled up at the start of the Vlog got some exciting stuff coming in this Applause episode tonights a big night

HALF NAKED WOMAN WANTED TO FIGHT CANDICE,2017-04-23T17:21:49Z,10.916666666666666,2664966,80070,Music I live I live all the way down there I ran here I run into David in the black who talked me into coming to play basketball and instead of finishing my run oh Im in right quarter oh but David still got the lead over there I showed this to this machine last week and people didnt understand how it worked just squeeze it and it says out the juice its really good maybe you notice maybe you havent Ive been shooting the vlogs on an entirely new camera set up for the last like four or five episodes Im getting a lot of questions about them I want to do a little tech segment I know a lot of people give me a hard time about tech segments and Im super insecure about it so if youre not interested in camera Tech Talk go ahead and skip to this exact time right here and thats when this segment will have concluded okay so Ive been shooting the vlog for the most part on this bad boy right here this is the latest and greatest from Panasonic or lumix its called the Lumix G H v I like it I like it a lot its almost right prior to that I was shooting on this thing in a 6500 by Sony this ones 2000 this one is like 1300 this ones nice and small and sleek this things pretty large and bulky which one takes a better image the sony which one has better focus the sony which one is better low light performance the sony which one do i like better the Lumix let me tell you why its simple i cant vlog without a front facing screen I cant do it this thing does not have a front facing screen so I love this camera but its got to sit on the shelf I need to be able to see my face when I vlog I really genuinely feel like the day of design and made this thing with youtubers in mind its got great 4k it also has a super powerful front facing screen its like the same kind of screen thats on my cell phone super good blacks gives you a really good image its got a slot there that holds two SD cards so it can shoot to both battery on this thing is good its like as good as the cannons were it does have full autofocus while youre recording its not Sony 6500 or Canon ATD good but its definitely good enough my favorite thing all time favorite thing is the fact that the the chip itself is stabilized so the recording mechanism inside of this camera is on a five axis gimbal or three axis gimbal or something and it keeps it really smooth also this is kinda stupid but I that the microphone input is right here like in its own special spot instead of being down here where all these other ports are like it is on every other camera I feel like instead of having engineers in some room design this that actually had people who use these devices sit down and design it the front facing screen I cannot say enough about okay now what sucks about it this has a tiny chip in it see that little little little little fella in there a chip size thats called a micro four thirds chip one inch aps c micro four thirds now chip size does mean a lot but like Ive been reminded for much of my life sizes and everything this thing does incredible things with that small chip the color reproduction the image itself I really like in bright sunlight its unbelievable but it falls apart when it gets dark outside low light on this thing is its pretty weak especially compared to the a 6500 focus when theres not a lot of light its just this thing is just worthless it has no idea what to grab focus on but thats okay because I do understand and I can empathize with hardware limitations hardware limitations are just the limitations of the actual hardware what I have no appreciation for our software limitations because what you can do with software is limitless and it should be perfect so this is probably my single biggest beef with this camera I never know when its recording look let me show you Im exaggerating but let me show you its recording right now see how you have this little blinky light right here thats recording give me something more than a tiny blinking light when I clamps down I want to know with confidence that its recording this light doesnt do it for me but then I accidentally touched this really unnecessary menu over here now I look down is it recording or is it not recording why is that red record light covered by this menu who designed this interface is terrible even if I stopped recording this stupid menu stays up so if I start recording yet its okay thats one beef number two this ones even more egregious say Im recording like I am right now see the blinky blink and then I want to use the tap to focus which is great tap right here cool now its focused on the nearest object wait did it stop recording is it still recording is it recording right now I dont know let me just check on the screen theres no notification how about on the blinking light there is none I have no idea if its recording right now lumix what were you thinking so in their defense that is just a software issue just that is a software issue that could be with the firmware update lumics get on it that is unacceptable next thing is about button layout when in movie mode which is the only mode Ill ever use it in when I press the shutter not the dedicated record button the shutter it starts recording that sounds insignificant its a big deal lumics thank you its great see this little button right here that says D is P as in display this little bastard right here alright that is what cycles through the information thats on the screen C display display display display this makes no sense the location is right there as in exactly where this thumb organically rests so while Im sorry on the fly Im constantly accidentally pressing this button and the screen turns off and sometimes Ill be recording and Im struggling enough to look for your tiny tiny invisible blinking red light and now is it recording I have no idea the blinking lights gone and then I press again the whole things off so those are my initial thoughts overall I really like it that will indeed be my new vlogging camera until something better comes along I think its expensive but I think if if youre looking for a very serious vlogging camera that I would say the Lumix is currently the best on the market despite the shortcomings I just outlined Music now hopefully I wont hit that stupid button so often okay earlier today I filmed a thing where I use the space machine full disclosure this is my friends startup and its my favorite thing ever its like a juice press you put the packets of juice in there it squeezes them delicious juice comes out then I saw that juice arrow the name of this was trending on Twitter because apparently you dont need this whole device you just you can just squeeze this packet of chopped vegetables and out comes the juice so I thought I would test it alright so this is the packet of chopped vegetables this is the extremely technologically advanced press that is required to squeeze the juice were gonna now did you see this its trying to go on Twitter right now were gonna see if you can actually extract the juice without this extremely advanced to Tesla iMac like machine ready alright but thats not that as much as comes out oh yeah honey keep going I had to squeeze for what you know Oh God Jonathan how many times have you seen over the top lets cut open the packet now come on imagine juice Im really getting tired Music yeah look inside its not inside our delicious good that is fiber brush vessel run right through give it this hows it taste its delicious thats great its great its really good its great and if you dont have a Jake at home just goodies reduce fun you still need the Machine of this I love it and I dont even like this stuff Music yeah wow thats powerful all that time shes ready for the heater theres a woman squatting out of the taxicab and the car Music that woman that woman definite that woman down there was just squatting out of a taxicab peeing on the side of the road and Candice said thats disgusting and then she wasnt afraid Music,140.33587786259542,technologically,0.0,1.0,NkfNLhgV6O8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkfNLhgV6O8

Hi-Speed Hoverboard & the NYPD,2017-04-14T20:43:44Z,13.3,5689424,132544,do you want me to put you in the vlog for your birthday todays Amalias 30th birthday happy birthday alright Music Applause Music see Candace drives Francine to school in the morning some days before my run Im a good husband Im a good husband and I go get the car for her you know mornings can be stressful in the household when you got a kid so anything I can do to help out count on me honey Music I think today is you know well first back by popular demand I think todays gonna be the day when I finally finally finally give a comprehensive review of the of the new one wheel plus yeah Ive been waiting for good weather Im waiting for X Billy nice outside one of those days where I want to shoot something outside and but first first realtalk sorry keep using that our Kelly song as the intro I know our Kelly is a bad bad man I just its such a good song alright real talk if youre not new to this vlog you know in season one even season two hours super consistent and uploading every single day almost always at the same time and since I started season 3 Ive been nothing but sporadic when I upload and I wanted to take a second to explain let me animate this see in vlogs season 1 and 2 the vlog really dictated a lot of my life maintaining the interestingness of the vlog the actual act of creating and then just the sheer amount of hours dictated my life for season three Im making sure my life dictates the law focusing on family is more important than focusing on making the episodes interesting my job is more important and spending time focusing on health goes above spending time editing the vlog now now the only way to do that and make sure the vlog doesnt suck is by being selective when I do it you know like we were with family in Texas the last couple of days it was all about family the baby was their own was there at Candaces parents were there that had to take precedent over the stress of creating a daily show somebody sent me this I dont I dont know what this is you know down at beam were working all kinds of things so were gonna start making shows and and movies and all kinds of stuff down there that means theyre gonna be more days and I dont make the vlog what matters is that these episodes are good and Id rather make them you know four or five times a week and have them be really good then make them seven days that we can have them suck and then the other thing its important is is sustainability its when I think back to why I stopped blogging the previous two seasons like I started to hate it and I think it was just the roulette like the fact that Id never had time to think it was just go go go go go which has its virtues but also after a year and a half it was just it was unsustainable so Im hoping this new sort of thesis this this this new approach to vlogging its something thats more sustainable I can tell you this much I love doing it again like the process now is so much more I know its more relaxing its more exciting its like yesterday on the plane when the baby was freaking out and Candice was freaking out and I was freaking out instead of also trying to make a video at during that stressful time instead I was like exciting about getting back to it today you know I looked at a lot of my youtube friends when they stop vlogging like Gina and Jessi BF versus gf those are my favorite YouTube channels some of my favorite vloggers you know they talked about the stress that it had on their personal life and other aspects of their life Im just trying to be responsible and trying to navigate that so Ill still see you almost every day Ill try to click upload amis every day but I hope this makes sense and Im gonna make exist the largest sometimes here at beam HQ we squeeze our own juice this happening Applause Music all right Amalia heres your birthday goose enjoy it thank you I got oh I got that seven go in there one I got last week oh it is good isnt that look at the house steady it is   mm hmm oh it feels fancy back here this is this is downstairs that beam but over there is where we built offices and little like its very professional here and then Jake and I are turning back here into just like a raw studio space so ceilings painted black were gonna put sound panels on them what else you doing down here okay putting a lighting grid in up here this gonna be filled with lights Lucas Mia light panels I dont know what a lighting grid is is this your personal Supper is this ours this is already gear yeah yeah this is what happens when you give Jake access with a company credit card stuff man we got this really cool follow focus okay this is our incisor I think this is really cool so ef s lenses right they have a motor in them for focus so what you can do is like a team Music so theres a store called supreme maybe youve heard of it they sell like skateboard clothing an erotic characterized the dreams but the fans the people who buy supreme clothing theyre called hype feet really getting to the gear and apparently today theres like the most insane seen outside of supreme oh my god this is the line for supreme yeah and thats the line for supreme and then thats supreme right there do you get anything good yeah yeah let me see let me see check it off how long did you wait in line two hours two hours pleasure to meet you rich who pays you when you got a deal with all this supreme pay you or the city do you get some free supreme t shirts no no you just got to keep the peace so tell let me ask you then what what is what is supreme culture supreme culture man is a fashion culture its about young young people doing things that they want to do and exploring everything man look you got little kids say you got that they all relate to supreme so much over other fashion because you see the designs the prints they real original man supreme and then the logo is strong man Supremes are strong logo it goes nowhere its number one Casey I think nice   thank you bro guy oh my gosh whats your name Im Chandler Im from services girl Chandler from San Francisco like your honestly like my hero like Im gonna cry right now like stay in school dont do drugs I want to drive the hate drug alright hey yeah alright good luck with all these kids Thanks take care Music Music New York City that have these street teams often they give away free stuff that I guess they just assume people are gonna want these guys here they give really free chocolate milk just one of the great perks of living here Im on the one wheel dramatic difference from the from the previous generation one wheel its is pretty incredible Music okay so theres definitely a learning curve here Im getting there Music not a lot of opportunities to test the off road capabilities of the wooden wheel here in New York City I really feel like they took care of all the shortcomings all the beefs that I had with the original version now this things like I mean its smooth is butter its crazier responsive its a lot faster I feel much more in control I dont know that Id become bull riding this in New York City traffic but I said the same thing about the booster I had my helmet I left my helmet blue test in traffic Music says the man not rich rich what are you thinking in one wheel its nice right its one day man Music I gotta say this things pretty pretty impressive one wheel you know I would say the question I get asked the most is should I get a one wheel or should I get a boosted board if I had an answer for it if you live in a city like I do boosted boards grace its wonderful on the road if you live in a place where theres any off road or trails or water or sand or dirt the one wheels fantastic for that so I could never ever say that one is better than the other but this one wheel is wildly impressed okay alright just give me go ahead and in the broad right there

Shame On You United Airlines,2017-04-11T19:13:33Z,9.716666666666667,7477474,175694,Music so yesterday yesterday I forgot to finish my I didnt upload yesterday see on Saturday on Saturday I dropped the family off at the airport I was supposed to go with them but we decided last minute that me spending 5 days with the in laws would probably be a terrible idea not a big fan of using your blinker are you Candace Im from Texas we dont use blinkers there they go goodbye family goodbye dropped the family off of the airport and then yesterday Sunday I had this big idea to shoot this amazing episode that started with me going on a significant run its Sunday Candace and the baby are out of town Im going go ahead and take advantage of this free time by going for a very serious run right now I got a little carried away with the run all right all right thats one one mile 2 miles three four miles 5 miles Music six thats 7 miles I mean it was like the first real warm spring summery day of the year I just I just kept running thats eight thats nine 10 11 miles just tying my shoe 12 miles all right mile 14 ran into these guys and this guy all right I mean like Forest Gump level kept running 15 16 miles 17 18 19 thats 20 all right Im going to call it there that was uh an even 21 miles great Sunday Run see and that thats where things kind of fell apart that is 21 Mi at an easy 8816 Pace I got back from the run and thats when I was like going to shoot an episode and do everything else get my day started but I took one of those hours you just kind of stand there and fall asleep standing up and then I thought why not just lie down for a second I havent slept more than 4 hours in the last week passed out still light out passed out and uh I just slept yeah till like 6 615 this morning so thats why thats why I missed an episode yesterday not cuz I was taking time off with the family like I said but because I went for an irresponsibly long run and then passed out and then slept like 14 18 hours like a hibernating grizzly bear and then here I am now its Monday all right Marlin I want to see that I want to see that hat lets see it look at this check this out woo you think this would look good than youy I think you should wear that every day man the bomb man twist it like this you know like yeah now you look like a boss good to see you Marlin thanks a lot nice hat Marlin nice hat maybe its cuz Im getting old you know people in the comments keep reminding me about how old I am heres the thing about old when people make fun of you and they tell you that youre youre stupid you can be like no Im not Im smart and then when people like call you ugly you can be like nuh my mom says Im super handsome but when people tell you youre old old is objective old is a number that you cannot hide from I am old Im 36 yeah and I guess that means that after a solid Sunday afternoon run that I just cant get out there and make a vlog cuz I have to sleep for 14 hours all right thats it now time to leave I now have a 30 to 35 minute cab ride to the airport Ill probably have about a half an hour of downtime there and then then like a 3 and 1 2 hour play thats what the rest of my afternoon looks like so how long of a ride to LaGuardia do you think sir its about 30 minutes 30 minutes yeah we step off the gas about 35 minutes you think we can make it without stopping for gas um I got 14 miles left well thats pushing it thats pushing it pushing it cuz Im going to be taking it right out of there Music goodbye New York City you will be missed hows the gas situation looking good looking good yeah looking good looking good good all right thank you and I am back at the airport thank you good luck finding gas flight boards in uh 45 having a little snack Lounge food wasnt bad it wasnt great but it wasnt bad Music interesting situation here so Im sure you saw it in the news but yesterday there was this video of a guy being ejected off of a United flight for they overbooked the flight they didnt have a seat for him they asked him to leave he refused they dragged him off the plane whenever anything like that happens I always ask myself what would I do in that situation especially today when Im actually flying on a United flight wish me Music luck seriously I dont know what to say this guy hes awesome thats what you wanted to say in the Vlog 6 million hes awesome nice to meet you Music so far so good I think were going to make it to Houston okay this is a quick like 306 hour trip Owen and Francine and Candace theyre already there so Im just meeting them

an explanation,2017-04-04T20:33:51Z,8.25,1800639,65517,I hope that makes sense eight and half miles into my run right now and my moms in town this weekend gave me a really hard time about these sunglasses she asked me to bring back the ones with the white just go ahead and comment below if I should stick with the purple or switch back to the white okay I would run all now hey so I made the pool thank you Monday morning big week this week Ive got two business trips one to New Jersey one to Boston nothing too crazy both are for for speaking engagements and I think were going to Texas although that might be next week nope nope Texas is this week they try not to travel as much for work lately like stay here Beach so lets get it done and thats been going yeah its been going well probably a lot for work can be tough on the family so thats also been going well keeping it clean this week yesterdays episode I I showed you we talked about the new beam HQ and I introduce you to Jake who just joined the team a lot of questions in the comments about whats he doing and what are we doing at beam I want to get into that because Im very excited that Jake is here hey hey dont how do we Jake how do we explain how do we explain what it is that youre that were doing together now thats a good question I feel like maybe we should go outside what do you think of it right so the company the beam the app we shut down with Kenan bought the company but the company is something much more than just that act and now were building out like a media wing to that company and thats where Jake referred so I was in Los Angeles lived there for a year and a half moved from New York to there and it was uh it wasnt for me it just wasnt my I wasnt my thing so when you know Casey came Colin was like hey were doing this amazing of a beam let me tell you about it of again of course so I moved out here last week got an apartment and yes okay let me break down for you exactly what exactly one is were trying to do okay trying to save time not being that the company here at the middle and the company is what may be me app when CNN bought being the company we shut down being the app because it wasnt doing very well so what theres a tech game intellectual property thankful resources no zu s oh and all the other company resources so even though the app is dead but even though the app is dead the company itself is still very valuable so you think its gonna be legible say that so now being that company in addition to being a tech team with intellectual property in all kinds of resources were not building a media arm to the company its going to have shows and were going to have our own YouTube channel and were going to have other stuff and this this over here this is where Jake fits in the meet on the on the media stuff it is big and the last and the last important thing is use one of my valuable sticker my channel and my channel these these sort of live in their own bubble over here and this is important because Im still going to be doing blogs and shows like this Nick still be doing is Vsauce we still have our channels this is what were trying to build together and this is this is still ours I hope that makes sense lets go back outside we wanted to shoot this scene outside but we needed a table so we could do that like funny cut we slap it Yomi okay we go find an apart lets just were in a playground were not just a park it so its a playground filled with children in a park were two grown men new playground filled with children with a video camera lets go Music were so right now we are in the throat of New York Citys Chinatown one of my favorite places have you ever been to game land no doesnt involve arcade you genuinely dont know what it it no is it the giant arcade yes okay I dunno I think Ive shown it before on the vlog but Chinatown ser or game land is like this old its an arcade in New York City that existed in the 80s but it just happens to still exist I proposed last time youre in there remember Ive just seen on the Internet oh youve never been never been there Music Hey whats up Wow dont believe the    what what games do you play in their sound Baltics thats actually a rhythm game is that we should check out yeah never in my life this is like a gigantic led thats what this is right LSD wall so we can win tickets and play what fun Applause Music and Music Wow healer and I remember saying male primes back but no shortage of packages a lot of packages but it has a rifle in it isnt it more so looks like a suitcase okay Ill see everybody else tomorrows episode where were going to be doing male time Applause Music,113.21212121212122,intellectual,0.0,1.0,vf9GpYiDqQ8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf9GpYiDqQ8
it's a BIG DEAL!!,2017-04-03T13:06:31Z,8.766666666666667,2222566,71381,Music so wet luckily I had on my foul weather gear waterproof pants waterproof jacket waterproof cell phone still wet though today Im going to be unboxing my new camera okay camera unboxing first I really like this hat thank you for sending it to me uh as I mentioned in an earlier Vlog about my new gear setup my main shooter now is this thing the Sony A6 6500 this is what I used to use this thing is much much smaller I also am constantly impressed with the image quality of this Jake and I shot a video for beam last week and we shot half of it on his gigantic red in 8k and we shot the other half on this little guy cut them together hard to distinguish one from the other but I want to get back to when I used to have this dorky camera sack on my hip at all times I used to call this my daily carry like my sidearm my old daily carry was a Canon g7x I still highly highly highly recommend this camera its Stellar its Dependable its tough its low light is incredible its not 4K the Sony RX100 Mark 5 very excited about this little guy now I used the previous version the image was Stellar the image was better than the um Canon but it wasnt that dependable and the focus sucked all right so this is a test of the Sony RX100 Mark 5 versus the Sony A7 R2 this image right here is coming off of a camera and lens combination thats about 5 000 and this is off this little po and shoot which is I dont remember how much this thing cost but its around 11 000 what do you think of the quality difference it looks good all right Im checking the focus on this thing ready Focus behind me focus in front of me kind of slow maybe Im doing it wrong okay focus over there focus on me this is how you Vlog youre filming something cool and then you switch it to your face and youre like hey that was really cool and when you say that part it should be in focus and its not and maybe I didnt set the autofocus right all right so I wouldnt I wouldnt judge this thing on this shot alone I will give it an exhaustive test um but Im very excited about it and uh until then it will live right right there on my hip you think you got everything you need yeah I did thank you very much whens the party um next week worldwide celebration though its going to be good thanks for the trip down memory lane I know good to see you hope those pictures work love you man peace look ready me Van van re Casey van Casey re then Casey smoking cigarettes and re that was an unannounced unexpected visit from my friend re short for Ariel res one of my oldest New York City friends hes having a huge party next week to to celebrate like the 10year anniversary of him starting his production company he was here to dig through all of my old photo archives for this like Bar Mitzvah wedding kind of slideshow theyre going to play during the party through that digging through the archives process we stumbled upon this gem let me let me set this video up this video is from 2007 this is a decade ago and my brother van and I were hired to shoot some videos in in Colorado I think Ive told you this story before and instead of doing that we like bought a van and a little mini bike and we tried to remake the movie Dumb and Dumber just when I think you couldnt possibly be any dumber and re who came with us re and I tried to remake that exact scene I apologize for the Low video quality in 2007 they did not have 4K Music where the hell did you get that from some kid in town traded him straight up to the van you know something Casey just when I thought you couldnt get any Dumber you go and do something like this and totally redeem yourselves were really doing it here you believe how young we were all right I have

context of whats going on so let me explain for my god hey guys this night this was a crazy idea that me and some of the people that I work with at Samsung pitched to the bosses and it was to have a night that just celebrated creators youtubers artists musicians like people who made things and that the boss that Samsung said okay which is crazy during it youre a tiara so we flew in like a hundred creators and we invited a lot more of not everybody could make it and the only people that were on the stage were creators the host was Francesca shes a shes a youtuber my friend Chantal is an artist she gave a performance and fell but now shes killing it hows she doing we had Tracy Morgan whos a comedian talk about a fact that he grew up in the ghetto and then rose up being very successful it was a night for creators about creators and it was completely done by creators Applause I stole some of this fridge for my friend Sam link to his videos below it was magic and I have to say it was one of the greatest nights of my entire career Music,123.75617792421745,presentation,1.0,1.0,l1lWWDr-yNQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1lWWDr-yNQ

Samsung Galaxy S8 Review,2017-03-29T16:46:42Z,7.216666666666667,4149688,114466,Gowan Music before I get into this review I want to disclose that this is not an unbiased review as in this is a biased review maybe youve seen the commercial that I star in watch me I mean I wasnt Im not being paid by Samsung to make this video Im just like work for them in the past in fact I had to beg them to give me this thing to make this video alright in general Im never I get it tech reviews but lets get started so as you can see the si is a fairly large phone when compared to the s7 and its really not that much bigger or wider and when you compare it to the iPhone 6 plus its a little taller but its more slender like look touchy touchy no well almost touchy touchy and its all about its all about holding them in your hand this is the key comparison here how they feel when youre holding them si iPhone 7 plus now one critique that I had of the s7 edge is that there was like a little too much edge like my fingers would always I kind of accidentally activate things and touch things because they touch the edge on the I mean s8 it really feels like they fix that like theres nothing awkward about holding on to the edge of this thing the side by side screen real estate comparison that is how much surface of the phone is dedicated to the screen as you can see the s8 here is all screen this has got a big fat chin a big fat chin and I gotta say when you hold this thing when you hold this thing in your hand its like the screen is sort of dripping off the edges it feels it truly feels it truly feels like youre just holding a screen in your hand and thats kind of amazing the s8 here feels a little bluer this feels a little warmer like this is more of a pink orange this is more of a blue I will say you can definitely see the pixels on the iPhone and on the s8 its nothing but pure butter like that is a clean clean text right there no sign of pixels nothing just razor razor sharp this is where you can really see the difference I need like a pointer look at this this huge chin all this wasted surface area and this is just an amazing image versus the iPhone I mean even even versus the older Samsung its just so much screen this is where the screen really makes the difference its just its just so much more screen for the phone sighs all right because this is like uh because this is an unreleased one I cant really go outside or film anywhere interesting with it so Im gonna go ahead and do a film recording test indoors with this thing all right this is gonna be the front facing like the selfie camera video camera test got an iPhone 7 here and I have this Galaxy s8 plus here ready on the lighting conditions very pretty dramatically here in my office funny I cant tell looking at the screen which ones better this is what the audio sounds like on the iPhone this is what the audio sounds like on the s8 let me light myself ready okay this is with extremely bright lighting in my face theres a little backlight action little my glasses action okay lets try the rear camera why do they bury on iPhone why do they bury the 4k settings in the setting menu instead of having them in the camera all right this this is the 4k camera test theyre both shooting in 4k trying to give you some camera movement I mean its really its so hard to tell youre looking at the screens as far as which has a wider lens very hard to tell it looks trying to frame them the same it looks about the same I think that the s8 has a slightly wider lens than the iPhone but it all sounds of just a massive screen so it could be the bigger screen again I would take this camera test with a grain of salt Im just filming in here I would love to film outside Im not allowed to lets simply look at the still photos okey dokey now Im going to test the selfie camera that is selfie stills again I really wish I had a prettier test subject but Im not allowed to show this thing to anybody so its just me me Im gonna test the flash on the camera alright thats kind of it that kind of concludes this actually this is like a hyper rushed first look at the Samsung s8 I dont know how much time with it they just they just gave me this thing and I gotta give it right back and while I do work with Samsung so take that for what its worth I was definitely not paid to make this video and I wasnt paid to say that like this things pretty amazing this is like its almost the cell phone Ive been waiting for since I was a little kid the cell phone been waiting for since I was a little kid is nothing but screen all the way like a pure dude is just holding a window to the universe in your hand and this is by far the closest thing to it just yet soon this will be my full time like real phone and thats what I can do like a super deep dive review especially on the video camera cuz thats my number one priority and this is another kind of terrible like super rush kind of like not that good tech review from Casey nice dad Music not sure if you can see that can you see out right there that little hole you know what that little hole is thats a headphone

experiment and I have to tell you it felt great and then when I think back to watch why I stopped like the frustration that I felt and you know what I explained when I when I ended the Vlog was that it had gotten like easy and what I meant by that is the creative challenge which is what I love the most had kind of faded and I spent a couple months thinking about sort of what that meant to me and I landed at a couple of places one it was like before I didnt see an end to the Vlog it was just like this thing that I was doing and that I dont know it it sort of felt like treading water versus swimming like to a destination and I realized that the impetus the reason why I originally started the Vlog 2 years ago was so I could share with an audience my company beam like what it meant to start up a company to maybe build an audience that might be excited about what I was doing and then you guys would actually use the product we were making um and that worked and it was awesome and you know like the first year pretty much of the Vlog so much of it was about my career Beyond YouTube and that was a big driving force and as beam started to like drift away as the company started to struggle it became less and less of this show and instead this just became like this heres my day heres what Im doing kind of thing and it became very routine but Ive spent the last Ive spent the last 4 months figuring out what this new company what this new project what this whole new thing is that Im building with CNN and I wanted to announce it on the YouTube channel but it it never felt right its not like were doing this were not like doing a show were not just building an app the company still called beam but the company that were building is much more like a lab like a laboratory where we we try different apps we build different software we make different shows were going to start a YouTube channel were going to its a whole bunch of stuff and the more I thought about like how am I going to share with my audience what exactly Im doing and then it was like  and it was like holy this is the exact same this is the exact same thought process that predicated me starting the Vlog in the first place so here I am exactly 2 years later starting another company and all of a sudden I feel like I have a purpose to do this again and thats like thats crazy exciting for me that makes me feel so good you know one criticism of the Vlog that I never understood was people were like Casey I feel like youre just doing the Vlog so you can tell us about your company and I didnt understand that as a criticism because that is the main reason why I started the Vlog and that is the reason that I most proud that is the aspect of the Vlog that Im most proud to share with you I love making videos I love sharing my life but I also have a really big career and something Im super passionate about Beyond YouTube and having a vlog as a way to share those other interests of mine is a huge its a huge source of motivation for me and then the what is that base its like 4 in the afternoon Miami how can the base be that let me try Music to Miami for my birthday was Candaces idea but it was a it

crazy out here Music I mean its like like 15° colder than it was yesterday hey Ive got a question um somebody sent this to Candace and me like a few months ago or many months ago this cute picture of Francine its like in this light box situation it goes like that has this pretty red cable we dont know who sent it to us but we love it if you sent it to us thank Music you m super windy out sorry about all the wind noise I have to go to this uh I got to whats up guys whats up you hey girl hey thank you where are you guys taking us exactly super eclectic you Reservoir Dogs Music this is a thats thats sopia this is like a CNN event what is this this is like a sales event it is a Sales Event its a national Turner Sales Event theres about 600 folks here um this is so dont know about Casey yet this is so much Im a surprise hes a surprise hes the grand finale I thought Anderson was the grand finale hes do you have any advice for me when it comes to my new relationship with CNN um I dont know uh H not super helpful Sav my money no so this is a this is a CNN thing its a big huge sales meeting conference they asked me to come and talk site to do it I havent met any of these people yet so this is a good way for me to get to know them they have food out there they have food right here oh when its done press this red button and then you can turn it off with this switch but just film me walking out of and make me look cool later Anderson wait they just called me Applause Music Applause wo a lot of uh a lot of interest in what cameras Im using in these current episodes everythings in 4k now I think everything looks better its crispier its cleaner the colors are better so let me get into it real quick all right so every episode I literally think every single episode of the Vlog was shot on this bad boy the Canon 80d before it I used the Canon 70D the last couple of days Ive been shot on this little guy this is the Sony a6500 and then these Studio formal shots are on an A7 s or A7 R2 main reason why I switch from Canon to Sony is 4K oh I was super uh reluctant to actually use this little guy I thought if I was going to use Sony go with the big guys a lot of vloggers like Louie and Ben Brown and people like that and Jesse Jesse uses this huge thing to Vlog with which the image on this is almost indistinguishable from the image on this when shooting in like good to average shooting conditions low light this thing still better altogether I do prefer the Sonys over the uh cannons with two major exceptions one is I do like like the native color profile of Canon better I I can color grade this and I still think this looks great but theres something about this that I like better and then two is the front facing screen its like its much harder to actually Vlog with this thing with it not having a front facing screen I mean youre just basically shooting blind the entire time which brings me to why Im talking about this today the single biggest problem with not having a front facing screen is when you think you think youre shooting with a super wide angle but its actually zoomed all the way in and youre just getting a close up shot of your nose I dont need a zoom lens to see this nose now with Canon thats not a big deal I would have and then I could see that it was all the way and I could just see I could correct the fact that it was zoomed all the way in Ive been struggling to come up with a solution Im not going to put an external screen on this like I need to be able to throw this thing around I think I figured out how to do it and this white pen contains the solution Music okay I know what youre thinking now at a glance you know if these white stripes are lined up here then its as wide as itll go if you look at the camera and its like that youre like oh its zoomed in bam like that and its as wide as itll go and you never need to check I hope that makes sense I know its wide right now because these white stripes are lined up I know its tight right now because the White Stripes are not lined up its all about the White Music Stripes its all about speed it you just have to commit to it as the Im fine by the way Im fine okay okay let me introduce all right this this is Kyle whats up this is Jack okay Kyle is the inventor and founder of one whee Jacks just a guy whos really good at riding one Wheels but you sent me the first one so I sort of owe you that was what like 2 years ago this is not mail time this is something else because Im pretty sure I know what this is it is what I think it is Holy good God you yeah so we need more speed so well I just want to know if its possible on my one wheel with a flat tire okay lid me helmets Music Music oh so clean so clean clean I just like to give a shout out to my sponsors thing is Music these guys are going but the reason why theyre here is because I ordered a new onewheel plus this is the latest and greatest they were in town so they personally delivered it for me I was going to do like a whole unboxing and testing video today but kind of feel like my hips sort of broke is there anything is there anything I should tell the audience about the one whee plus uh you can order one whe Plus at one whecom thats like a little too pitchy I dont know that Im going to put that in life is more than motion it is music more than rest it is peace more than work it is Duty more than labor it is love more than enjoyment it is Music blessing really glad to have met those guys I mean Kyle the CEO his background is as an engineer but just entrepreneurs that had a crazy idea

good one baller the carpet comes today Im so excited about the carpet howdy howdy is the carpet happening Music L yeah yeah wa it looks good right great you think I love it its quiet how you doing I do I mean you cannot imagine what a dump that basement used to be and now it is like a few carpet tiles away from being our new production facility last week uh last week I posted a video about um this fundraising charity effort that my friend Jerome started that I was psyched to be a part of to raise money for the people in East Africa affected by the horrible drought and famine thats taking place there right now now if youre a longtime viewer of this channel you know Im not one who shies away from you know to use this platform to sort of share causes that I believe in whether thats whether thats helping an individual or um or a broader cause like like what this initiative is about but I have to say in my life I could have never imagined I mean we raised and this was not my doing those guys Ben Stiller and Jerome those guys did a lot more of the work than I did I just made a video about it and I shared it we ra is almost 2 million 2 million to help people affected by this this horrible famine and the important thing is in addition to all of that money which will help people by doing this fundraiser not only did we raise the capital but we also brought a lot of attention to a cause that needed it huh these are my new house shoes these are shoes that you wear in the house some might call them slippers but these have good soles on them so I can actually wear them to Music Music how you doing good day for goodie d what is this um were in line for D what is this lineing for D youre waiting in line for cookie dough yes I am this whole block is just for cookie dough yep youre in line for cookie dough yeah hello everyone this whole line here is to come in there yes it is is it like this every day yes it is 10 yes it is how good is your cookie dough its very good apparently it is nice to meet you best of luck this place just sells ice cream cones filled up with cookie Music dough T is can I get a picture with both of yall absolutely oh this is great oh thank you for reminding me was obsessed with you of course its unreal together its unbelievable we just crushed 2 million right now but heres the thing Drome its not the 2 million its the awareness that comes along exactly and that was the go in the first place little discussion with case is that 2 million raised Turkish aines agreed to 200 tons of cargo in total y so we found a very special product called plump PE nuts basically if a kid eats one bar of it uh every day for six weeks then hes he moves from being almost dying to being being fine I bring one so we can taste it we didnt raise the 2 million to hand it over to the UN or any NOS its actually being all of the organization is being done with people that we know and the reason for that is to make sure that every penny of it goes to help people so to all the haters in the comments saying that all that cash was going to go to the government or Warlords or whatever there will never be cash handed over only the food stuffs the products and drones actually working with NOS on the ground there to help distribute this stuff so this is the Plumping nuts and we visited the factory yesterday they Bas in Rhode Island for baby its for people less than 5 years old we want to buy locally because locally you can buy rice locally you can buy flour locally you can buy water theres a lot of private companies that are selling huge trucks of water we are we are a drop in the ocean I think thats the most important thing to realize is that like we raised 2 million we had 80 000 people behind this whole thing and the impact we will make is this this small group of 880 000 people came together and did the maximum they could you know a lot of people are still telling me like I had 20 on my bank account I gave 15 like thats so beautiful you Music know youre doing good work man Ill see you soon Ill see you soon Dr love you I love you too Candaces office where are we going we are going to Dean and Mayas book party is there

for this congratulations on congratulations congratulations on your your movie and thank you for this chocolate that kind of concludes um Mail Time Music theres a huge controversy taking place on YouTube right now and its about YouTubes restricted mode if you dont know about this controversy theres some links below Phil the Franco does a great job of explaining the whole thing Gigi gorgeous gives uh a really smart video about why it is a big deal my best understanding of this whole restricted mode controversy thing is its just like YouTube once again screwed up communication they up communication with their community and the community gets all upset about it because they dont know whats going on and YouTube doesnt explain whats going on I know Ive spent time with the executive team at YouTube right from Susan the CEO all the way down wonderful wonderful people and theyre trying to do good things but theyre failing at something very very important which is making the YouTube Community the community the community of creators feel respected appreciated and and to keep us informed of whats going on with this platform that so many creators depend on for their livelihood and uh companies that have huge user bases like YouTube its very hard to communicate with everyone I empathize with the struggle what wed love to hear about are the initiatives by YouTube to help us creators stay informed and understanding of whats going on and how best to leverage this platform and and just in short better informing what our relationship with the plat looks like and what its going to look like into the future okay heres why this is a big deal Im zooming in heres why this is a big deal and why Im talking about it right now YouTube as a company has absolute ownership over this video creator community that exists on the entirety of the internet nobodys making great videos on Instagram or on Twitter or on Snapchat or on Facebook if its great original video content online its on YouTube but YouTube is vulnerable meaning that YouTube is threatened meaning that if the YouTube Community doesnt feel well taken care of and a competitor comes along with a product thats just as good but could give creators a bigger audience a better opportunity for creators I dont know what would keep creators with YouTube versus trying other platforms and I think were at a very interesting place right now in the world of technology because were going to start seeing other companies gun for that space that YouTube currently owns fdm y boat rolling up on me right here so I say this because I want to express my own frustration that YouTube at least outwardly from an Optics perspective YouTube doesnt do enough to make their Community feel like theyre prioritized and I know that the people at YouTube know this but their Monopoly on the space is not forever it is vulnerable someone else could come along and do what youre doing and do a better job of it and every time something like this takes place that upsets the community it jeopardizes the Loyalty that the community has with the platform I still love you YouTube I just dont understand why you dont communicate better with the Music creators eny enemy are you ready honey not scary its not scary yeah okay whoa ran into my leg I dont know how this thing works honey ready there it goes oh no is that funny all right lets put the little drone away for now want Daddy to hold you you want Daddy to hold you

WE HAVE 10 DAYS TO GET A MILLION DOLLAR$,2017-03-17T20:21:27Z,8.516666666666667,3846367,185466,this this is the story of what can happen when the power of social media is leveraged for something Music Applause Music Applause good I just wanted say thanks so this all started yesterday last night when I saw the tweet from Jerome Jeromes a good friend of mine hes like a big social media guy but hes someone whos really concentrated his efforts in social media towards helping others what Drome is talking about here is the current humanitarian crisis taking place in Somalia which isnt reported on that well here in the States but it it is a uh its a famine thats been brought on by a drought and a number of other geopolitical issues but its affecting over 6 million people in Somalia alone so he tweeted that video he directed it at Turkish Airlines specifically cuz theyre the only airline that flies to Somalia and and then it started to pick up traction and but uh my friend Jerome jar brought this to my attention that he thinks we can all help by getting an airplane filled with food and water to Somalia we cant let this happen we have to help these people use this hashtag get it trending get Turkish Airlines attention and and quickly this started to gain traction it started to become bigger than just Jerome here you are this is the origin story this is how this happen Okay Friday night at 800 pm thats when I was on on front of the computer and I saw horrible fing in in Somalia I Googled how to get a flight so toishan is the only Airlines going there I decided okay we have to do something we have to try to get this flight and fill it with food so I text Ben hey Ben do you see whats happening in Somalia millions of people are about to die from famine just like in 200 11 and this is Ben Stiller the famous actor uh huh the original one were launching the love Army now were going to publicly talk sh to provide a flight then were going to ask food companies and people to donate food and were literally going to fly food in water now its go time do you guys want to document it yes he just said yes and the next day he was here so that was an easy yes for sure and thats how all of this came together I didnt think youd actually do Laughter it bring up a little bit of light all right Jerome onea W yeah never won never one tell me whats going on give me the full give us the full update okay heres whats going on um about 5 days ago I saw an article online about whats going on in Somalia and I wasnt aware I think media barely talked about it and I saw there is there only one airline that goes there its Turkish Airlines and so I thought okay why dont we ask turkey shance if we can use that flight and fill it with food and bring bring some help there do you feel like youre bullying Turkish abolutely not I feel like we are getting them an opportunity to do something amazing you dont feel like youre shaming them into helping no were like do you want to help they can say yes or no so we have a call with them at 100 pm time minutes no no in 5 minutes sorry in 5 minutes we have a call with them thats where youre going to find out if theyre going to help with this campaign or not with with the head of communications and everything this still tell you do what you can watch it Music yesterday there Time game on it its ready hello hello hey how are you today hello yes okay J yes Im here with Chaka and W and Ben and everybody is here okay so this phone call here is the official call where hang hang on guys where theyre finding out from Turkish Airlines if they can actually use their Caro planes to bring food and Rel and supplies to Somalia um so yesterday we were told um that on so theres this big 60 ton cargo flight and then after that as long as we bring food you guys will make room right somehow no matter if it doesnt really matter if its a white body narrow body as long as you know we find Space okay okay thank you thank you bye bye bye thank you guys what just happened what happened we have a Caro flight 60 tons 60 tons cargo flight to fill with food for Monday 27 that will go from Istanbul to Somalia and then we have an extra 40 140 tons that we can uh use of this space for the next six months this is incredible all right if you didnt catch what just happened Turkish Airlines just agreed to fill up an entire cargo plane with 60 tons thats 120 000 lb of food and relief to go to Somalia they also just contributed another unless Im saying this wrong I think its another 140 tons that they would put in their other planes that like extra space to go to Somalia this thing just got real like I just I sat there I witnessed it there was an idea and then a tweet and then the Tweet turned into a movement which became something else that has now become action is this good yeah I I I thats fantastic very important to recognize here how big of a deal it is for Turkish Airlines to have done this uh this isnt a commercial or anything for Turkish Airlines they just stepped up and gave no idea what the cost could be that is a tremendous amount of resources to give an entire cargo plane and then plane after plane with extra cargo space to bring relief and for me personally look I retweeted it yesterday when I saw Jerome was doing this but right there when this had happened these guys did all the heavy lifting they did the hard work I offered to be a part of the fundraising so whats taking place now is theres a GoFundMe account thats linked below where theyre trying we are trying to raise all the money to pay for all the supplies and infrastructure to bring all that food to Somalia Ben Stiller is letting us use his charity the Stiller foundation so all donations are tax deductible and will be managed appropriately youll be able to see and track everything donate if you can I know theres like a lot of bad things going on in the world right now theres a lot of things locally of concern but its but its its hard to imagine a greater priority than you know millions of people starving to death and knowing that a couple bucks could impact that in a positive way and then also with some truth which is the fact that uh you know there are millions of people who are are starving and struggling because of uh this drought because of this famine not just in Somalia but in Ethiopia and Kenya South Sudan and Sudan and Uganda um these planes and all this effort and all this energy thats being made by this little campaign is a drop in the Hat but I think a very important first step is one of awareness which this seems like a very good first step towards but uh theres some links below if you want to understand more of whats happening there uh I also linked below the American Refugee committee which you can also give money to theyre doing work all over Eastern Africa Ill send this with like this cool video that Turkish Airlines sent us uh thank you everyone for watching thank you even more to people who contribute and thanks especially to Turkish Airlines for for for doing this as the only airline that connects Somalia to the world will be more than happy to deliver your love and assistance to Somalia on your behalf as a Turkish alons family were proud to be a part of this great cause thank you come on I just wanted to say thanks,165.44031311154598,communications,0.0,1.0,93dDP-O4VsI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93dDP-O4VsI

there that is massive but really good the cinematographer also shot Fight Club you do not talk about Fight Club there were a lot of ideas being thrown around for what this commercial should be about but the one thing that I cared about the most the one thing that I wanted to talk about during the Oscars was us was the YouTube community and my question for Samsung was like can we make a commercial that celebrates what we do what we all all do no matter how small you are no matter what you make videos about could we make a commercial that celebrates this entire community and play that commercial during the Oscars as if were like on stage celebrating this they were super into it and they were like lets do it and whats over here its J with banana ins side oh my God those look really good PBJ

okay so his dad is filming Casey right now right now its a commercial for Samsung and whos Casey uh a vlogger which were in night shoots are especially tricky I still feel like we have the what do you what do you do right now I think its going very well um a lot of moving Parts the trouble with repeating the same line over and over and over is that its really hard to say it naturally when youve said it for the 50th time and when youre trying to read a script thats not your I mean its my words but its like my words written down then its thats right you have to like take ownership over your own writing its well thats what movie stars are good Im not a movie star Maximus well thats about to change so heav imin all right how you doing good like time is passing its 1230 in the morning Im on New York Times its 330 in the morning but know tired Music Max I cant I cant show the commercial in this video cuz obviously it has to air on TV first heres the basic premise its literally like me and a tux standing in a parking lot and Im delivering like a monologue like a speech and the speech is about us is about this community and I literally am trying to introduce this community of creators of makers to the audience of the Academy Awards like literally the first line is allow me to introduce the rest of us cuz Im trying to introduce all of us creators to an audience that that views the Academy Award as sort of the total like all there is in film making I want them to know that theres us out there and then from there the commercial like Cuts away to other videos to stuff that we found on the internet to stuff that we actually shot using cell phones just to show like the diversity of the kind of content that that this community makes while Im like delivering this like really strong passionate like forceful monologue about what it is we Music do so were done thats a wrap thats a w thats a WP Paul thats a wrap I mean thats a wrap on the entire thing thats like 3 days of

doing the medical stuff that he does like he took his helmet off and he was feeling around to make sure that he didnt have you know brain matter or anything else coming out exciting country nearly lost his life to a bullet that pierced the bottom of his rescue helicopter fragmented flew through his helm and it pierced the skin just an inch from his left eye but more amazingly he climbed back in a helicopter the next day once again putting his life on the line to rescue injured soldiers from the battlefield Jimmy told me there is nothing more important than being there for his comrades Music

people the story about how you were shot in the head yeah its one of those things like that Ive been through and Ive experienced that if I hadnt been there and done that I wouldnt believe it well what happened was we were going in to go find some guys who needed some help and some bad guys shot ak 47s at her helicopter and got lucky with one of the rounds went through the floor split in a couple of pieces and one of those pieces went over my sunglasses and under my helmet through my my scalp there this isnt totally lucky shot so its like part of the bullet tip yeah a little fell I wouldnt worry about that little fella you clean up nice we were in Afghanistan we sort of snuck in as journalists but really what we were doing there was like tattooing we were embedded with you guys embedded with the pararescue team and we were actually just tattooing them we set up the only tattoo parlor ever in the war zone in Afghanistan your your tattoo I think was my favorite of the entire Scott did a

uses practical joke cards and hide in peoples ear and peoples gear and then youd like dig through your gear and thered be gay porn and it was like just about the funniest joke on the base but right after you were shot NBC or ABC News was there interviewing you youre on TV with Lester Holt and he was interviewing you about the most serious thing ever being shot and he went to show him your helmet and inside your helmet was a gay porn playing card Jimmy Jimmy I happen to have that Lester Holt footage to Brian good evening to you you want to get a sense of how intense the fighting has been in

sergeant Jimmy settle wrote next to it says it all almost got me and thats the date I knew a live birthday the bullet was struck the bottom the aircraft fragmented and then part of the piece went up here above my head but another part went right over my sunglasses and then right underneath my helmet here I did a little animation to sort of explain to people what a PJ is Music there an Air Force pararescueman or more commonly known as Cajuns they spend most of their time jumping out of helicopters Music rescuing injured servicemen personnel or anyone that needs rest Music and what makes them

PewDiePie vs. Free Speech,2017-02-14T21:40:45Z,4.083333333333333,3856179,123735,Music Applause YouTube drama there is a whole you know this theres a whole sect a whole category of YouTube creators and they just sort of talk about the drama that takes place among the top YouTube creators out there its a little bit like TMZ for YouTube YouTube drama is something I try my very best to avoid but something came up today that I think is is bigger than YouTube drama it feels like actual news the New York timescom the New York Times that is the newspaper of record top story Michael Flynn resigned as National Security adviser huge Earth shattering news just down to the right of that though hes the most popular on YouTube now Disney has cut off ties with PewDiePie and YouTube has distanced itself after he posted anti semitic imagery online Google News similar situation top stories about Michael Flynn second story about PewDiePie how this came together is that the Wall Street Journal actually did a story on PewDiePie and they found nine instances since August wherein PewDiePie made anti semitic jokes The Wall Street Journal even went so far as to edit their own video of PewDiePie which is Music Applause you with me so far PewDiePie made a bunch of bad anti semitic jokes about Nazis Wall Street Journal called him out on it but then because of that story on the Wall Street Journal because of that video by The Wall Street Journal Disney which owns maker the MCN that PewDiePie works for works with Disney severed ties with him moreover because PewDiePie is the biggest by far the biggest content creator on YouTube with was like 53 million subscribers and almost 15 billion views it shines a spotlight on the entire platform whether he wants it or not and whether YouTube wants it or not PewDiePie does represent this platform all right so what is what is my opinion on this what is my take on this well Id like to preface all of it by saying you know Ive met people PewDiePie I spent some time with the guy he and I chat via text every once in a while and in my very best judgment I dont think the guy has a hateful bone in his body I dont think hes interested in preaching hate um I dont think hes an anti semite and I dont think his intent was to spread hate what is it in Spider Man with great power comes great responsibility with great power comes great responsibility when you have 53 million subscribers it does come with a responsibility and that responsibility is to understand understand your audience and understand how your words are going to be interpreted so while you may be saying something as a joke your audience may not always interpret it like that and I think with an audience that size it could provoke something that could definitely skew the moral compass of a younger audience in a direction that really benefits no one literally as Im trying to finish this video right now news just broke here Ill read it to you YouTube cancels PewDiePies show pulls channel from ad program after his thats a thats a bigger deal um in conclusion uh PewDiePie I think itll be okay people have a tendency to forgive and forget and while ultimately Im not a fan of this kind of humor um there is nothing I appreciate or cherish more than free speech in any capacity uh but I think what this does underscore is that for uh for YouTubers just like everyone else in the world you can say whatever you want but at times there will be consequences for it Music is,153.3061224489796,responsibility,0.0,1.0,J1tGSkOJw7c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1tGSkOJw7c

BEST VLOGGING CAMERA Sony vs. Canon,2017-01-24T21:07:18Z,5.983333333333333,3844313,135069,Music W welcome to another tech review that doesnt make any sense I tried to write this without looking at it and then I tried to use this as a this is going to be a technology review I know not all of you like my tech reviews so if youre not into tech reviews or whatever just like Ill let you know when I post some non te review okay now that theyre gone last week I got really frustrated because my uh mega fancy camera lens broke I wasnt frustrated cuz it broke I break a lot of stuff I was frustrated because Canon refused to fix it even though I tried to pay for them to fix it and I threatened to finally switch from Canon to Sony something Ive resisted for a very long time my favorite my all time favorite my total favorite vlogging camera and this is is this year Canon 80d before the 80d was the 70D both great cameras the reason why I like them so much this flip out screen is everything when shooting Vlogs you can see what youre filming you can pick the focus thats why I always stuck with this camera check out how many of these things Ive got by the way this is my collection of Canon ads those are all of the adds that I bought while I was vlogging 11 canon adds those are all the lenses I went through those are all the microphones I burned through when youre shooting daily videos you just accidents happen you break these youre tough on these if you slow down to treat these like theyre precious you miss the shot I will say since Ive stopped daily vlogging Ive broken exactly zero cameras because like I can be more careful and responsible now all those cameras thats the price of turning out a new video every day 7 days a week for like 5 or 600 days straight in any event back to my technology review the Sony cameras in this box um this is it something else all right the Sony a7s Mark I wow nice camera strap battery plug battery is this charger I dont know what that is and thats it Music thats the uh things for the strap Sony why not just have like a fix thing that looks like that why would you have a the microphones going to pick that all right so just to quickly test this out Im trying to figure out the operating system its really different from the Canon that Im used to using Im going to take this outside and just do some like okay going out now very very next shot is going to be on the new Sony camera ready all right this is the new camera this is just terrible weather right now I dont know what it looks like cuz it doesnt have that front facing screen I was talking about the weather outside was just bad really bad this is the new camera Im shooting on it right now uh this is what it looks like compared to my Canon 5D markv which typically gets this exact shot uh all right here are some other shots from outside I wasnt happy to be outside all right here are some glorious Glamor Shots on my new Sony A7 the worst weather I could have possibly picked to do a little outdoor test these pants are waterproof by the way all right initial thoughts without even looking at the image I know this thing yields an incredible picture thats why so many YouTubers use it also the form factor of this like how small and metally and just awesome this is feels really robust I mean I like everything about the hardware but why would you not put a touchcreen on this literally to get this to focus you have to like tap tap tap tap tap tap why not just touch the screen like on so many of your competitors devices and on every cell phone ever made like why would you not do that what are you thinking and Sony a lot of YouTubers use this thing this is like the go to camera for vloggers these days why not just help you know the thing about being able to look at yourself in the monitor when you f vlogging is something that I would describe as like first person film making and what that means is both the narrative like the subject is first person its about the person creating it and then the the production Im also the person making the movie and when you cant see what youre shooting it sort of has this soulless quality to Music it inflammation Im super excited about this new camera its fun to have something outside of the sphere of what Ive been working with for the last decade I will be using it a lot the main reason why I got it is for videos like this that I shoot here in the studio to leverage its 4K and autofocus and general awesomeness so thats it I feel like um I feel like among all my tech reviews this ones like one of the less good ones thanks for watching n Applause,149.24791086350976,inflammation,0.0,1.0,B3t_Phob6Gs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3t_Phob6Gs

DJi Phantom 4 Pro+ vs. Inspire Pro vs. Mavic Pro in 4K,2017-01-19T17:28:49Z,7.216666666666667,4471307,98082,Music Music another another another drone review video you you Oh anyway its dark hello from East Farmingdale Long Island home of adventure land because Adventure land is so cinematic and I happen to be out here in Long Island this seemed like a perfect time to do a test of the brand new of the DJI phantom 4 pro quick caveat this video is not sponsored by DJI or any other companies this is just a tech review this is the latest and greatest from DJI it looks exactly like the Phantom 4 but it has more sensors and a much much better camera I just got it yesterday I did it unboxing crux of todays video is going to be pitting this consumer camera versus DJ eyes prosumer camera this is meant for sort of novice and hobbyists this is meant for semi professionals now for good form Im also gonna be flying the DJI Mavic DJI Matic is a much smaller consumer hobbyist drone also my favorite new tech of 2016 this thing is incredible but its image is limited which is why Im excited to try out this procure today obviously there are a lot of hardware differences across these drones here the Mavic is the most compact tiny controller that you need a phone for coolest part of the Phantom 4 Pro is that the screen is built in you dont need a phone for this sucker and then this is this like now the main thing how to determine is is this thing actually better than this thing or is it just slightly bigger cooler looking and harder to deal with to figure that out Ive recruited my brother who is slightly bigger cooler looking and much harder to deal with to pilot the bigger drone were both flying in full auto on the camera so no manual settings Music Applause Music thats some important considerations here the lighting conditions that were flying in that day were not optimal it was really flat and everything was kind of even looking this thing doesnt perform well low light thats not really represented here Music Applause Music Applause Music this really isnt like a one is better than the other situation there isnt like a winner and a loser here I mean theyre theyre all let me let me explain this this is a prime example of something I talk a lot about when it comes to camera gear called diminishing return let me explain Music yeah your drone analysis with the Mavic phantom 4 pro and the inspire 1 professional and theres three factors here youve got your youve got your value ease of use and the quality of the image the Mavic clearly has the best price the phantom moderately priced the inspire is expensive when it comes to which one is easiest to fly the Mavic is the easiest to fly no question the Phantom is pretty easy to fly and the inspire is well it takes a little bit more practice its hard to its not that easy which plans finally on the quality of the image image quality on the Mavic is fine image quality on the Phantom perfectly good image quality aspire is borderline professional so its hard to say which one is best it really depends on what youre looking for what the priority is so if youre watching this video at all thinking about buying a drone and then this is and you still dont know where you should land heres a heres a good way to think of it this Mavic I think yields an image that is closely liked and maybe what like a high end galaxy phone would look like or a an iPhone would look like really great quality people look after here that looks great but a professional but someone with a keen eye might the pro here is a big step up and I would liken the pro to something closer to like like maybe a low end SLR or super high end point shes like a really high quality image that when people look at that they might be like wow that looks professional and then the big guy my little brother took it home and I have the inspire I would like him to the camera that Im shooting this on right now this right here this is like a Canon 5d Mark 4 its a prosumer borderline professional camera that people will see and theyll say it look like that looks like a movie or a TV show that looks so pro so thats kind of it which ones my favorite this one its just so small thank you Ill be back soon with more technology reviews Music you Music,110.99307159353349,considerations,0.0,1.0,nsycuxfou6Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsycuxfou6Q

GETTING OLD AND STAYING YOUNG,2017-01-16T14:09:52Z,6.833333333333333,2498264,107608,402 in the morning Music Music so I am up at the crack of dawn this morning to go run a race the race isnt a big deal but this whole things a big deal for let me explain morning old tradition of mind always have a bagel before a race todays a big deal because how you sir in a lot of races but I havent run one in three years and today is me confronting that by running my first race in three years and my little brothers coming there for moral support and I paid for the bagels well thank you for the delicious bagels bye ladies Music Suns coming up race starts in uh Music weve arrived Im gonna go register for the race now I Music thought I could sign up today youre not allowed to sign up race day to register they told me no they told me to go home I found the race director and he says you let me run I dont get a time though or like a bib where you put the number on but whatever I get to run its official a little concerned about the temperature though its freezing everyone has on sweatpants and tights and this is what I brought to run in Music ready starts in ten minutes okay race starts in like four minutes you know what it is I mean I run every day and Ive run 50 races before that butterflies right now I think what it is like Im getting old Im 35 now and I can tell myself that Im in great shape and I feel young and all that but when you actually show up to something like this and theres a clock and a time its like an actual test of how well Im maintained its confronting that that I think makes me a little nervous wish me luck Applause Music Applause Music Applause see you ten miles Music super super happy with my performance in my first race out in three years you know the timing tip right Im too here on my on my phone I came at 103 which puts me here can you see this so I ran a little further at 102 miles a six minute 14 second pace I think it puts me around 20th place out of maybe like a thousand runners felt good though as you get older the price of maintaining your youth goes up and up and up and what that means is when youre like 15 16 18 years old you know wherever the hell you want you dont have to exercise youre skinny its easy in your 20s it gets a little harder you get fat in college you become even older and all it gets harder and harder the older you are the harder you have to work there was this guy in front of me during the race and gray hair gray mustache he was ahead of me the whole race we started together but he was ahead of me the whole race and I was chasing him down as best I could and I finally caught up to him at Mile 9 one mile left and I pulled up next to him and he turns mean he goes 60 Im 60 years old at 60 hes as fast as I am at 35 busting my ass hes as fast as I am if theres one truth that I know is that the source of the Fountain of Youth can be summed up with one word work Applause Music by the way the main reason why I brought my kid brother today I mean I like hanging out with the kid but the main reason why I brought him was so he could film me while I ran he missed the shot of me crossing the finish line because he was in the car getting warm thanks Tina Music,97.31707317073172,confronting,1.0,1.0,mWEor6Kgjto,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWEor6Kgjto

i'm not that happy,2017-01-12T13:00:23Z,8.566666666666666,4572732,143975,Ive missed these little chats I want to give a quick update on what Ive been up to but I also want to do more like more videos like this where Im just talking to you I am making some really really sick like proper videos like proper YouTube videos for this channel one of them is about running I shot it in South Africa with my friend Dan its really good this is the video here its like really next level cinematography kind of like big ambitious awesome movie coming soon pS running pro tip if you want to run 20 faster just put on your headphones and listen to the Tron soundtrack by Daft Punk guaranteed speed increase back when I was daily vlogging used to say that talking to the cameras a little bit like talking to a therapist I mean I dont know who you are I dont know who most of you are but just like a therapist you dont really talk back much and you give me really considerate feedback in the comments but anyway Ive missed these little chats and thats why I want to do more of these I dont know maybe Im just being like a little sentimental because my family still in South Africa playing with penguins yeah but I always have things I want to talk about like this shark video I saw yesterday and these videos serve as like a great platform for me to discuss the things that I care about another thing I want to get into today for todays video is about happiness on YouTube and all that first I want to give you like a two second update one I just got back from South Africa in Las Vegas and all kinds of other travel feels good to be back in New York City focus to the new company downstairs the thing Im doing with CNN its coming along really well were going to be hiring people soon building Studios making a bunch of videos Ill keep you updated as things progress but its starting to like turn from like a liquid of mystery into a gel of slightly less mystery its coming along though three lifes gotten kind of weird since I stopped daily vlogging I got so used to this lifestyle of like literally working 20 hours a day to crank out those videos I like dont know what to do with myself now cuz I have all this time I did build a gaming station here in the studio Ive been working on a gaming setup in there youve both done so 10 more on that soon and Ive been like crazy focused on Fitness which feels really great but mostly Ive just been enjoying like returning to being a human being but I do miss creating something every day so thats why Im gonna do more videos like like this but Id say the biggest update since I stopped blogging like the biggest thing is that I have all this free brain space like it kind of hard to explain but when youre making a video every single day you wake up thinking about whats todays video whats todays vlog episode gonna be and then throughout the day youre just trying to create it and then youre up all night trying to shape it together you fall asleep you wake up the next day just like Groundhog Day you start over again Music and that would out for like 600 straight days or something like that and being away from that for a month like Ive been able to really think about big things that I want to do and redirect my career it feels great and I hope these videos will serve as a little bit of a vessel for me to share that with you so yeah happiness theres this small youtuber called PewDiePie you poodiepee pewdiepie made a video like a couple days ago and it was about whats called forced positivity on YouTube and by the way Felix I like these kinds of videos I think theyre insightful and theyre smart and I encourage you to make them the video was about how a lot of daily vloggers have a sort of an aura of forced positivity or like a level of superficiality around their content and about how that can be dangerous because young people might perceive that as like if youre not happy all the time youre doing something wrong or or might make you feel less satisfied with your own life because youre not happy like the vloggers that you watch day in and day out now me as a former now retired daily vlogger and someone who gets like emails and tweets every day from people saying I appreciate your positivity I thought I should chime in on this kind of my thesis when I was daily vlogging was to like pluck the happy and fun and interesting aspects of my life out of the 24 hour a day that is my life and turned into a 10 minute video for you the audience and I chose that approach because I think much like a lot of you I enjoy videos that make me feel good versus ones that are overwhelmingly depressing no one wants to watch a video of someone groveling about how lame their life is but I do think that means that there is a big opportunity for viewers to see that as these sort of totality of my life like my life every second of my life is that happy and it isnt like no ones life is that happy I try really hard to live like the happiest most positive life I can but life is ebb and flow and my life has been no different especially throughout the vlog and I can remember when I was daily vlogging the hardest days for me to make videos were days when I was like having a fight with my wife or something miserable was happening and I would have to kind of push that out remember in particular trying to daily vlog when we were in Texas at Candaces grandfathers funeral I didnt blog the funeral but I was trying to make a video that day in shield you viewers from like that difficult part of my life and maybe that could be perceived as dishonest but I think I was always pretty clear in saying that the vlog was about the fun positive interesting aspects of my life and not about the whole picture that was my life and I think the important takeaway here is that whether you are a daily vlogger or someone who watches daily vloggers is to know that we are all human we all have struggles and just because you put your life the difference that vloggers me included have is that we have the opportunity to edit our lives and edit out the parts and leave in the really happy parts but know that they exist so I want to end this video by sharing with you what is my like really naive basic recipe for finding happiness in my own life and I will say that whatever Candis is down were bummed out or were fighting and I tell her this shes like Casey shut up Im not ten years old I dont need your stupid recipe for happiness but here goes whenever Im really down I just try to focus on whats really good I told you this is basic and what I mean by that is like what I look back at life and I see like those when I was with a really bad breakup I would focus on the fact that I had friends and people who loved and cared about me and I would take solace in that even much more serious stuff like 10 11 years ago when my dad had cancer that was one of the more difficult things I ever dealt with in my life but I would I remember thinking at least he also has a job that gives him healthcare and that was just like a little bit of something for me to focus on that was positive out of a really really situation thats kind of it its like today for example its freezing cold and snowing outside but its so cold I can keep my juices refrigerated without having to use any energy thats kind of positive just quick caveat this video is not at all intended to be a commentary on mental illness or depression or anything like that its more about vloggers like me and the kind of superficiality that vlogging can have Felix mentioned this in his video too but the depression and mental illness is is real and something to be taking very seriously I put a link below to some online resources to people who may be struggling

WORLDS LARGEST HOMEMADE DRONE,2016-12-21T22:14:51Z,11.183333333333334,3313257,109318,Music Applause Music spe no none of it was fake it was 100 unequivocally without any ask trick or any explanation real but there was a lot to it so I wanted to make a video and explain I got the selfie stick check out the name of this hotel its day one of production were headed to the uh location now theres Santas Village the Suns Up This is as sunny as it gets here and were like 10 minutes away from the first shot Id seen pictures and parts of it while it was being made by this right here this is the exact moment when I saw the Drone complete for the first time oh my God I thought you were going to come look at it were going to set it up for you and everything oh I stay until 2 in the morning making  like this ever existed before this is ridiculous you cant even fly this in North America a little bit about that drone that is a 16 motor hexa DEA copter thats hexa Deca copter it has 16 31 in carbon fiber propellers powered by 16 independent Motors it flies an entirely redundant battery system propeller system flight controls and motor controls the total diameter of that drone is 10 ft the Drone itself weighs 165 lb with me my snowboard although ring attached to it it came in closer to 365 lb it has 16 batteries and at 100 throttle has 1 50 lb of thrust the Drone has 4 00 amps of potential current at any given moment it takes about 400 amps of current to start an American V8 automobile engine so theoretically that drone could start up 10 V8s at the same time for Lift comparison that drone could lift 350 DJI Phantom 4 drones it had 81 KW of available power which is about 108 horsepower which is a little bit more than the average motorcycle it had enough power to power an average American home for 40 straight hours and probably the most interesting aspect of the entire drone was just the sheer amount of redundancy needed to safely lift a person into the air it had to be a large aircraft with 16 motors or more it had to have enough thrust on each of the axes to recover from a propeller or a motor controller or a motor failure this thing was a true commercial machine comparable engineering or manufacturing work to like a regular manned airplane or helicopter this thing was no joke this wasnt built in a garage this was a very very serious Music Applause machine that guy Justin his wife Elaine and Stratton in the truck there they built this thing and it took them the better part of the last year to do it todays either day three or day four we completely Chang locations like different town different everything we to drive here that right there thats a proper ski mountain so this is like our and we have like some pretty amazing locations here this morning Im very excited about this now there were some assertions online that I never actually flew or that it was CGI or the whole thing was computer generated well one have you ever seen anything computer generated thats that good I saw Star Wars yesterday and I could tell what was fake and what was real but but I get where the criticism comes from especially because theres never really a clear shot that shows me being pulled and then lifted into the air and then coming back down without a cut and that was done on purpose that was done with purpose and let me explain Music Applause Music you see I couldnt actually be pulled by the Drone and then fly into the air as like smoothly or this is the Drone this is me thats my snowboard I imagined it like this drone pulling me going off the Jump and I would soar like that the reality was very different if I was being pulled by the Drone like this like you saw in the video which is real and then Id gone off a jump like this heres what would have happened the minute I left the air I would have swung like this like a pendulum so the only way to fly was to have the Drone literally lift me very carefully lift me straight up and then once I was underneath it like this it could fly anywhere provided it kept me kind of dangling like this so thats why like before I go over that gigantic building you see me flying and then Im going over it you never see me lift off even in the one where Im jumping that snow bank if you look closely I dont actually ramp off the snow bank just in the Drone pilot just was very good at like lifting me like this before it it looked like I was launching off and then flew me away the other big question I saw a lot was about whether or not I was strapped in and the answer is yes I was completely rigged safely and professionally and two no I wasnt rigged in at all let me explain I think Im more excited about todays location than any location thus far this week its amazing right this is like a different planet in all the shots where Im just like being towed and Im like racing around through the streets and going up the ski mountain and Im just riding for all of those I wasnt strapped in at all like there was no safety there was I could just let go of the rope and the Drone would take off now when I was flying when I was actually being lifted it was the opposite I I did not want to be able to let go or rely on one freezing hand to lift my entire body weight up so for that I had like this wire that came out of my arm because it couldnt come off my waist or off my back like this it would just be impossible to ride so it had to come through that one hand so my other hand would be free to ride I feel great this really sucked but because there were like 16 rotors here they were sending so much wind down that when I stood like this the snowboard here acted almost like a fan blade with the wind coming down and literally like spun me like a top Applause that happened the first day they tried to fix it by like attaching a string to my foot going down so theres a guy on the ground that could keep me from spinning but the string looks stupid thats why I didnt use any of that footage in the end I figured out that as long as I was like holding the board like in a super gnarly grab where I look like a real snowboarder then the wind would flow through it so thats why in all the shots where Im flying Im holding the board Im grabbing the board and I look like a rad snowboard dude from the 80s but also that was the only way to keep the rotor wash from spinning me like a Applause top just like a super abbreviated backstory as to how this thing came to be this was like one of my crazy ideas that I pitched to Samsung like uh almost a year ago we were going to shoot it this summer in the Caribbean cuz I wanted to fly over an island riding on a surfboard didnt come to fruition cuz like so when they asked if I wanted to try to do it this winter I was like yes this is the holiday video and then things just kind of snowballed from there thats it that was the final shot 5 days of shooting done in the C and thats it man we did it all right thats it thats a wrap on the entire production and if there are still any doubts as to the authenticity of what we did Im going to be releasing the 360 video probably tomorrow or something you can like pause it and look around and try to figure out how we faked that too we didnt fake it thatll be posted soon all right any other outstanding questions as to how we did this ask below Ill try to answer them on Twitter or something uh okay cool good to see you again have a great holiday Music Music Applause Music I know it looked like it was I know it looked like it was just Jesse and me that made this whole movie but this is the actual this is the actual Team all right hit it here am I blocking everyone all right good work everybody thank you everyone

i miss vlogging,2016-12-08T18:35:08Z,8.2,3937605,187059,Music its been a while since my last Vlog its been like 12 or 18 days or like 6 months or something I wanted to give you a full update of everything that Ive been up to for starters Im still using caces closet to uh to shoot videos in uh um thank you still eating 1 pizza good and Im also still drinking that green juice and its still Music delicious still riding my booster board through traffic still flying my drone Music Im still riding my booster board while flying my drone Im still opening boxes Nike self lacing Hyper adapts oh my God and my marriage is still perfect Francine turn two to I got her a pair of Yeezys Ive been playing a lot of video games and Ive been spending a lot of time planning videos that are like Bigger Productions especially my holiday video which youre going to learn all about soon I havent done a production this complicated since well before I started vlogging on my way to the airport still doing this kind of a lot and Im still back at the airport to get Im back back at the airport so yeah not like a whole whole lot has changed but there were like a million more questions about exactly what Im up to with CNN so it is our pleasure to welcome you into Atlanta where the local time is 915 pm see Im flying down here to Atlanta cuz this is where CNNs headquarters is thats uh thats CNN headquarters right there so were here for a day and when I say we I mean the entire Beam Team is here in Atlanta with me cnnq Beam Team and this trip is just to meet some of the CNN staff like a lot of the tech people are here in Atlanta just wanted to come down here for a day say hello get to know them you guys look awesome so yeah in the video that I posted last week where I explained that I sold my company beam to CNN and Im going to be working for CNN now I gave zero explanation all I said is I dont know what were doing and thats completely true but there is a lot of context that I can share with you that I havent shared with you making a video every day on YouTube presented all kinds of opportunities and as I was assessing those opportunities like what do I want next for my own career I realized in order for me to go to the next level I needed to do things that were bigger than just me I needed more resources than I personally had access access to as the YouTube channel and the Vlog just exploded the opportunities became like I wanted something much bigger and now I had access to it one of the companies I met with was CNN and they were just as excited about working with me from a media perspective like a video TV YouTube Everything perspective as they were about what we could do from a technology perspective with the squad at beam and I should say at first I was like this is never but as the conversations progressed I real just how perfect of an opportunity this is exactly what Id been looking for beam and there were a lot of misconceptions about this but beam first of all beam is a company were a technology company were a software development company and were definitely more than just the one app that we launched last year and that app we had a really successful launch but the app like you know we didnt compete with Snapchat um thats why were shutting down the app now but theres a difference between the app and the company itself and CNN was very attracted to the company itself self and it was the app that demonstrated what we were capable of as a technology company one very important distinction here and theres a lot of misinformation about this online especially in other peoples YouTube videos who seem to just kind of be guessing all the intimacies of this deal this was expressly not an aqua hire this is not a situation where CNN hired all of the or some of the employees of my tech company so they could use this guy over here to work on their website and this guy to work on their mobile app and beam the company we are staying together we are not leaving offices were still going to be operating at a beam headquarters right here in downtown Manhattan in fact were going to be expanding and hiring more people to work out of this space right here not one team member left the company not one person was asked to leave the company not one person asked to leave the company we are staying together as the cohesive team we have always been focused on Building Technology and very in line with the mission that weve always subscribed to as a company the difference now is that were going to be in what Ive been doing in the media space that is YouTube and what I did in films and what I did in TV and my whole knowledge of the media space and then what weve done in the technology space were going to put them together and create a new company and were operating autonomously we are downtown CNNs Uptown we are downtown CNNs here in Atlanta we have total freedom to create whatever we want to create and now we have that freedom with the vast resources of CNN and look I know I didnt answer any specific spe as to how were going to do that and thats what I meant in last weeks video when I just kept saying I dont know what were doing cuz we havent defined the what and were going to take the next 3 five 6 months to really figure that out but thats the broader thing like that is what this whole acquisition that is what this entire thing is about the last thing that was like falsely reported everywhere I dont know where people get their facts on YouTube but um this YouTube channel is mine this is my channel to do whatever I want with CNN did not buy this channel from a business perspective from an AdSense perspective from a creative perspective this channel will be my channel to do whatever I want including Vlog if I decide I want to Vlog again or whatever and again I just think that speaks to the confidence that CNN has in us to build something they didnt want this they want whats next and that was a huge part of what was so exciting for me so I hope that makes sense I hope that adds a little a little color to what Im up to um Im excited I cannot remember the last time I was this excited for the future for whats to come next I will say I do I do miss vlogging um I miss like the get up and go I miss the grind of like make something every day I miss clicking that upload button I miss like your feedback and your comments like I miss all of that but I but on the flip side that like I love having my kind of sense of self back when you make a video for the world every day its like am I doing this for me or am I doing this for and the minute I stopped making videos every day I I kind of felt like I I kind of felt like I had my life back and that felt kind of special also not to be too like personal but at night when I used to sit by myself in my underwear in the dark editing my videos now I like sit in bed with Candace and we watch TV and stuff shes really cool I love hanging out with her all right thats it for this update um Im going be uploading a bunch of videos really soon Im doing something crazy for the holidays uh talk to you later

The Vietnam Notebook,2016-11-28T13:00:03Z,15.466666666666667,7286390,328467,Music the Vietnam no sir this is the story of an adventure I took with my kid back in 2012 Music Music Vietnam was is one of those places on our list place we always wanted people right yes to people this is our first morning it was that kind of tired where who was physically painful to get out of bed we were super jet lagged Music Music for the leg one of our attorney taking a train from Connecticut to New York and then a plane from New York to Tokyo Tokyo to Vietnam it was like a trap Music these information is not in my notebook were only 44 minutes behind and the grand scheme of things thats nothing also its 12 hours we had to you that doesnt really have much bearing am i screwing up you see every year towards the end of the summer right before we had to go back to school I would take Owen on a big father son trip Vietnam was our tenth year in a row Music this was our first trip 2002 in the Bahamas it was something I took a lot of pride in something that was important to me because as a kid its something I always wanted and as a parent it was a way of kind of alleviating the guilt I had from working so much but mainly I just love sharing new experiences with my boy I thought it was one two three days but its actually one two three days okay this is where you get a motorcycle Vietnam the idea behind this particular adventure was to get a motorcycle state going on the back and then drive through the vietnam countryside a couple of things i learned quickly a lot of scooters in vietnam not a lot of motorcycles i found the guy who said he could get us a motorcycle then we got there and it was a scooter so then we waited while they put together a motorcycle that they eventually gave to us thats the bike thats our bike right there that little blue thing so we start here yes going to the hobby I was sick Bobby so we come from here yep do my job to here and then to here first right on the bike there are no words that can describe the lawlessness that is driving in Ive ridden a motorcycle in New York City for years but riding in Hanoi was different it was it was chaos Music six hours about two hours in our motorcycle journey its much calmer now its cobber its not top eventually we escaped the city and landed someone that looked a lot more like what I had imagined Vietnam look this is snake one it snakes in there if some these snakes and snakes and bees and honey I guess they just let it ferment and that snake one this is just all bumblebees here what does it taste like thats why something coming Music oh and just had his fourth choco pie of the day look at your teeth calling us your teeth give me a smile those teeth let me see that I know I made it seem like this was an adventure me a story about riding a motorcycle through the jungles of Vietnam but its not this this is a nostalgia movie this is a movie about what my relationship was like with my kid four years ago see when I think of my time with my dad I only remember moments moments of he and I in the car together moments around holidays but I was one of four kids he had a full time job we never had solid blocks of time together and when I look back at my relationship with Owen all I remember are these huge chunks of time that we set aside just to be with each other were rearranging all the furniture in our sleeping quarters to optimize exposure to the fans it has its 99 degrees up here with 99 percent humidity careful dont knock down the curtains Music Music Music Music this is the bridge we just crossed I dont know that Id call it super safe seems fine no one has a little fan club over here the motorcycle trip was like four days it was fun it was hard it was fun the first day and a half Owen didnt have a seat hes sitting on the aluminum cage on the back of the bike as passenger on the motorcycle Owen seat which is this metal right here is not terribly comfortable so were going to appropriate this pad for additional personally I use an old inner tube to attach the cushion I think its pretty good comfy we werent going anywhere there was no mission no real finish line no destination it was entirely a journey of experience and along the way there were things that really stuck out and it was the weirdest things like I dont think either of us will ever forget the hot water heater in this house we stayed in okay this is where were staying describe to me the shower wiring situation see this is the shower here thats the hot water heater there raw wires there amazing situation here the bank I shower situation changer I Music literally have no idea how we ended up down below with two women and a baby Music oh and being in the middle downtown and town I can you couldnt see him either you could have to trust your father we eventually made it back to Hanoi the motorcycle adventure was over we did run out of gas on our way back we ran out of fuel but the trip wasnt over we spent the night exploring the city and then the next thing we thought 35 percent alcohol by volume so thats about as strong as vodka and it comes in a one gallon plastic jug it cost three dollars we didnt buy the booze but we did decide to spend our last couple days in Vietnam going on a boat trip carabao yet lets hope that now for whatever reason I dont have a lot of footage from this boat trip as you know that there was a mother American tourists on the boat with us and and well doing karaoke I got terrifically drunk off very inexpensive wine Music I spent most of the night peeking overboard while it was asleep and the next day on the boat didnt do much of anything Music that was kind of where our Vietnam adventure ended no my intention for this was to make a travel video instead though I found myself editing four year old footage and experiencing this time with my kid all over again do you remember our trip to Vietnam uh huh what do you remember that trip what do you think of when you think of that trap the cruise the biking team this trips like that now that youre now that youre old now there is nothing in life that highlights just how fast time passes like watching your kids grow up and to see this knowing what the next four years of parenting was I guess to look back if there was one thing I would have done differently it would have been to go on more of these adventures with my boy but thats the thing you cant change the past I am glad though that I can look back on this time I can look through these video clips and read this notebook

i'm ending the vlog,2016-11-19T18:16:38Z,10.416666666666666,8200298,329474,its not clickbait I really am ending the vlog yes Im starting a proper daily vlog Im psyched so this is the first vlog entry but let me start this morning back in New York City yeah I was a I was a youtuber before I was a vlogger and I was a filmmaker before I was a youtuber Im not gonna give any of that up its just this the last whatever 18 months 500 600 videos this experiment its over Music you know what I when I think back to why I started this vlog I spent so much of that time sitting here talking to you about this premise about this idea that I need to challenge myself creatively and Ive gotten lazy on this platform and it hadnt been posting and by issuing a mandate to post every single day I would challenge myself creatively in a way I had never done before and thats exactly what happened and I think for the first year of doing this I felt that fire under my ass I felt that challenge every single day I woke up every day thinking what can I do today to make the greatest video possible well then you see how famous you are now really you see this oh thats nice thats nice thats nice the most famous UPS Meru internet celebrity Marlon man you know whats gonna happen up here though right its gonna be Marlon and Casey yeah and I dont know I can probably like six months ago something like that it started to get easy I found a rhythm I found a system for approaching this daily video that was no longer a challenge and this vlog I feel like turned into the one thing that I didnt want it to be when I started which is just me making a little video about what my day was every single day the creative challenge faded away something easier took its place and then that easier thing was exasperated by wild success on YouTube since starting this blog have earned over five million subscribers Ive done over a billion views since starting this vlog and that success combined with kind of a creative complacency I think yielded something that I dont like something Im not proud of which is that like I know how to do this and do it in a way thats pretty easy and have it make me very successful on YouTube and make a great living via Adsense and and grow this reach but what it hasnt been doing is challenging me it hasnt been the creative fistfight that I want and need every single day and the more I wrestle with how to find that creative challenge the more I realize I will never find it as long as 16 hours out of my 24 hour day Im dedicated to to uploading this daily video I have to kill this before I can give birth to whats next Music Music its like my favorite metaphor which is like that Tarzan metaphor that I talk about its a couldnt be more appropriate this idea that like life or career my career is this huge jungle that Im trying to navigate my way through and the only way to get from one side of the jungle to the other the only way to get to where I want to be in my career is by swinging from vine to vine and grabbing onto that next opportunity that next vine to take me closer to where I want to be and the trouble with success is that it makes you very comfortable and look in September inside of 128 day window I did a hundred and fifty five million views and I earned one point 1 million subscribers thats a kind of YouTube success that is like I could have never imagined when I started and that makes you very comfortable that kind of success sends me good just keep doing what Im doing right now and this success will continue but that means holding on to that one vine in the jungle and not reaching for whats next and and the more I thought about like how am I going to progress my career how am I going to figure out what how is my career going to evolve how am I going to figure out whats next in my career the more I realize I have to first let go of this vine before I can grab on to whats next Music and when I think of risk I think of like I think of like my 19 year old self abandoning my job in Connecticut and running to New York City with nothing and taking a big chance on this dream to become a filmmaker but in success and look Im 35 years 35 years old and I make a great living doing what I love I think I found some degree of success in my life when you found success risk its a whole lot different because risk means jeopardizing what youve earned what you have and giving up this vlog is is certainly risk this is a tremendous risk but the thing that this vlog has yielded is opportunity by reaching almost 5 million people a day via this channel via this its presented me with just this tidal wave of opportunity and the more I look around at that opportunity and the more I think of what do I want out of my career do I want to be making vlogs when Im 40 years old and the answer is no like a career is always about progress its never arriving in one place and staying there Ive always approached everything with that mentality certainly when I think of the long game that is my career this was a big stepping stone but this was not the finish line and thats a really scary thing to admit to yourself especially when my channel is still growing but thats not enough of a reason to not embrace something new and thats exactly what Im doing and what Im doing next is a whole nother video that I will dive into and share the intimacys of with you but its time to embrace a new opportunity its time to push for something else because the success of this vlog has not satiated my appetite its only made me more hungry this is the most literal example of that platitude I love to share that is with each success comes a bigger more ambitious goal with the success of this vlog it has only made me hungrier and Im acting on that right now by moving on from this from this blog you can do it so what does that mean for this channel well first Im not giving up YouTube at all I will be uploading I will be uploading regularly I will continue to pump out videos but different kinds of videos the kinds of videos that take a little thinking more than a day to produce the kinds of videos that have to really envelop myself in before I can make thank you for coming along with me on this journey that has been the last year and a half thank you for letting me share my life and my perspectives and my ideas with you and thats kind of it stopping is not easy I thought about going to like two episodes a week or three episodes a week but then I realized I cant grab on to whats next unless I completely let go of this so the only way to truly move on is just to drop the mic so with that Music Applause Music whos gonna tell you when its Music whos gonna tell you things arent so Music the world

man Im just watching you right now its dope bro take care all right Casey all right this is the the famous uh Venice Beach you might recognize it from Grand Theft Auto Im here in California for work I have a shoot later today but its a shoot where Im like an actor Im like a character Im like in it Im not shooting it Im not directing it Im just in it and I cant talk about what it is but its something fun and awesome and cool that youll see soon enough but Ive got a little bit of time to kill and I thought this would be a good time to finally test out the go Pro Karma drone I didnt bring my mavic cuz I dropped it in the river but I have my Phantom 4 so Im going to test them head to head all right here we go ah there you go heres Jerome to help me test Dron good surprise to see you here what are you doing in Venice maam I was just I dont know something told me to be here today okay I got the Phantom 4 mhm and I got the karma the karmas a virgin its never been flown before wow I want to do the same exact shot with the Phantom 4 and then the same exact shot with the karma so we going to race by the way the Drone fridge youve seen already in todays Vlog was on the DJI not on the Music karma this fandom Ive flown a thousand times Im completely fluent with it the GoPro Ive only flown once and it was under the supervision of GoPro first time Im ever putting uh first time Im ever putting drone blades on the karma so that has a black part on the top and a silver oh you got it karma is the same process as on the DJI so far Im going to fly the DJI first because I just know how to do it and theres less question marks if youve never flown a DJI before the controllers pretty good it works really well do you know what like the rules are are we allowed to fly drones down here I have no idea probably nothing lets do this okay so here you be cameraman then okay all right the shot Im going to do is straight out to the beach over the Rocks over the Surfers and back Landing the Phantom took some practice but Im very very good at it like a like a boss yes without having really flown it this controller is incredible look at that no phone nothing big fat screen but if it doesnt work as well it doesnt matter but it is nice feel that pretty slow to boot up ah shoot cuz I havent done this before Im going to have to set it up okay here we go Karma ready to start wow okay incredible start stop button that was very fast and efficient nice work GoPro here we go Moment of Truth here ready for takeoff Dr lets do this Music takeoff was a breeze nice work GoPro um all right now Im going to turn shoot you know what are you not recording I wasnt recording I I dont see any okay take two Im actually rolling this time uh this is going to be my first landing ever with a GoPro Karma uhoh B violence not bad okay that was not using an automatic land feature that was just just me crash landing it but not oh wait look were missing a blade thats not good how did this get over here its hard this is not a conclusive review but so far very impressed heres what the footage looks like Music your Music AF your Music purely from an image quality perspective I do think the GoPro has a better picture than the Phantom 4 the DJI flies better its easier to control the software is better but but in a head to head just on image quality I give it to GoPro all around though I do think that the Phantom 4 is the superior Drome so I havent seen Jerome here in a long time and I convinced him to come with me but we went in the complete opposite direction of his house and now I have to drop him off somewhere so he can get an Uber like a thg you dont want anymore on the side of the road I cant drive him home Im going to miss my shoot so Im literally just having to kick him out and like Im sorry I feel like I terrible friend right now drum drum Im just going to leave you here with that woman thank you thank you for not leaving me alone good to see you my friend um I hope to see you again soon yes keep your hands off that girl Jerome you dont know her we walk together all right good luck getting home I hope you dont get kidnapped bye Jerome bye bye Music okay look at

what's the point of working?,2016-11-02T18:26:42Z,12.983333333333333,3488220,93459,Music its like 500 in the morning right now the city is still asleep except for that girl right there Im on my run but todays going to be a very very long day today ends like 25 hours from right now Music very full very full day today this is a very New York City scene right here produce being delivered in the back of the yellow taxi and busy isnt bad busy busy its good Im very excited for this super full day all right ready I gotta show this to you see see that right there see that you know what that is that is gray hair the last couple of months for me have been incredibly incredibly stressful theyre wrapping up soon but in the interim its just been like yesterday I didnt upload I posted nothing there was a day I made the entire day on the phone in meetings just like really uninteresting stuff I would rather post nothing than post something that Im not excited about so the end of the day I had nothing I had no episode it edited no video kind of I felt like I felt depressed like I felt sad like something was missing so like 10 oclock last night I was at the gym getting swole I was listening to a guy named Dan Ariely whos a behavioral economist he was talking about why we worked in his entire sort of thesis was predicated on the idea that we work because we want to not because we have to it made me think about my youtube channel and the fact that Ive made like 600 videos in the last couple of years and how much I and all the things I dont get to do in life because Im so focused on my work the vast majority of the work that I do including here on YouTube I get paid for but it definitely is not why I show up I get it out of this like longing or hunger for accomplishment or this idea of needing to complete something professor I was listening to he equates it to like climbing a mountain which is a perfectly its an appropriate analogy because I love climbing mountains look here is a picture of me and my homie Graham at at nearly 23 000 feet above sea level my brother van put that note in there right after we got back so why dont we climb mountains I dont get paid to climb mountains its not fun do I look too happy then Im not happy Im close to death right there we climb mountains for the same reason that we work its because as human beings you have this desire to do something to complete something whether that sense of completion is getting to the peak or clicking upload or just going home knowing you thats it Im anything conclusive to end this monologue with other than we interrupt this program to bring you a special report this sound was all screwed up for like that entire scene I just realized I was editing deep theres a little switch right here and if its at plus 20 it sounds terrible you need it up minus 10 so on my camera I permanently glued it down so I apologize for that horrible sound but it will never sound like that again now back to our show Music this is so awesome Music Music whoa Music sorry about that sound with this and shooting on a GoPro on the regular wind heading up to 50th Street down

college,2016-10-29T00:21:39Z,9.866666666666667,3163089,81038,you can give me a hard time for this in the comments if you want but I slept at the airport and Im still late for the airport Music it is 540 am Im at the dallas fort Worth Airport in Dallas Texas I have like 40 minutes before I have to get on the flight first flight out headed back to New York City Music Music this is our one minute flight and honestly I considered taking the 10 hour flight last night that would have been like five hours to our layover in three more hours but I realized something when you gotten me home an hour earlier this billion thats why I slept in the airport hotel I have food and granola for breakfast on this plane Music thank you thats good to be back in New York I guess its whether some bullsh just that thank you very much all right you see where Im going there yeah thank you very much Music I totally forgot today is free Halloween party at our house Im not invited into moms only Music I couldnt find the boosted board so I had to take a taxi its rainy out today Im not normally a big fan of taking taxis its so good to be back in this studio I missed the studio like youd miss a family member all right okay so I want to do some work today on the Vietnam movie everythings set up right how I love it what I left yesterday Im going to tackle it Im gonna get some work done Im gonna get that movie closer to completion Music Music Music I havent known one of these episodes right this right talk about something in a while so thats whats coming if youre not into this maybe come back tomorrow and Ill do more skateboarding or something so yesterday I was at a college huge College in Texas into this gigantic QA with like 800 people and there were a couple of questions that kept coming up and this is from a bunch of people that are all age you know 18 to 24 25 I think a lot of my audiences around that age and I wanted to sort of get into it a little bit Ive talked about these ideas before but theyre really ripe in my mind right now because of yesterday you think its okay that I wear this shirt even though it has a sharpie stain right so we spent some hour asking questions and we did another like 15 minutes for the audience asked question and some of the questions were like is my college education worth it how do I become successful on YouTube how do I make it as a filmmaker how do I make it on TV and journalism how do I theres a common thread and thats this big question which is just like Im here I want to be here how do I get there theres this desire to understand how to get from A to B then that makes perfect sense to me theres nothing scarier than starting your life out starting your career out and having no idea how to get to where you want to be then my answer loosely my answer is always a version of the same thing and that same story if you want to succeed if you want to truly succeed in a career especially a creative career there is no absolute predefined trajectory theres no recipe that will equal success if there were everybody would follow that recipe because this is the greatest job in the world so what that means is its on you you have to define that trajectory you have to define that path and some obvious questions are like why am I going to college if they cant teach me that or why am i working for somebody else if Im not gonna learn that and and theres a very real very sensible answer to that which is that every experience you have in life whether youre shoveling washing dishes or waiting tables or youre pumping gas or maybe working at McDonalds because there are muffins are delicious you have to take each one of those experiences as a tool or a building block and its the aggregate of all those experiences that you will be able to build your career youll be able to find your path the kind of success that youre looking for I learned so much about how to make a living as a filmmaker while I was washing dishes I didnt know it at the time and I think education especially a higher education like college is a really big building block is a really big tool you are doing nothing but consuming information youre filling up your tool box with all these tools youre going to use to build that career so if I had to wrap up this monologue with something that makes sense like with one singular idea its that until you get to a place where you want to be until you can understand the direction that it is you need to go in life to achieve what you want to do you have to take every experience no matter how terrible they are or how wonderful their you have to take each one of those as a tool that you will later leverage to build that career in the comments below please let me know you think about this staying here and if I should continue shooting back here at or if its too weird Im feeling really good about it I dont have a specific timeline as to what it will be done but I think sooner rather than later but it definitely will not be done by tomorrow if I can talk to Francine about about how her Halloween party went especially because I didnt see her yesterday I was traveling its still pouring rain outside but I really just cant take another taxi cab so this will be another electric skateboard ride in the pouring rain all right I did not realize it was raining out this much Im not worried about my safety Ill be fine but last time I was filming in skateboarding in the pouring rain I was using a GoPro this is my big camera my laptops in my bag all right expect a complete broken water damage gear report hey there this is your complete broken water damage gear report happy to say that the boosted board is a little bit soggy and the bearings are a little bit slower but it works great additionally the camera survived the water no problem even the microphone worked so my backpack is not waterproof that kept out the water so the broken water damage gear report is everythings cool later that night Candace and I went and checked out the new mall under the World Trade Center its called the oculus Music look at the size of that screen its like 500 feet long we are in the oculus we like we have a babysitter at home what do you think of this oculus place what are you most excited about look theres more
