# Youtube Speech Analysis Dashboard
A dashboard allowing you to analyze the speech patterns of your favorite YouTubers!


## Purpose

### The idea for this dashboard first came to me after viewing Data Time's YouTube video called "I analyzed all words on the Mr Beast Channel" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXeNZeLSsgY). Essentially, Data Time got access to all the transcripts of Mr Beast's published videos and did a textual analysis of them. I had the idea to broaden the scope of the insights that Data Time gathered from Mr Beast's channel to all YouTube channels with a user friendly interface.
