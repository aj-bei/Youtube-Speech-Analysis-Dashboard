Selfie Waves,2022-11-17T15:01:24Z,25.2,4950863,287665,Music hey Vsauce Michael here on July 1st of 2015 a longstanding ban was lifted visitors were finally allowed to take selfies at the White House this is the first legal selfie ever taken on a White House Tour but a year before the ban was lifted in February of 2014 I met with the president and secretly took an illegal selfie while on the toilet In The West Wing thanks Obama why am I admitting to this crime now well its time for the truth who took the first selfie really few people would call this a selfie but it is the oldest known selfportrait a depiction someone made of themself that includes Head and Shoulders it was sculpted more than three thousand years ago by Pharaoh akhenatens first Chief Royal sculptor A guy named Beck next to himself Beck sculpted his wife to Heart making this also a contender for oldest known asy but the roots of the selfie go back further than this we have been making things that resemble ourselves in whole or in part intentionally or not for as long as theres been cause and effect just looking into a pool of water creates a kind of selfie A Primitive ephemeral one that you cant preserve or send to anyone but it is undeniably an image of the self made by the self even the earliest life forms on Earth were capable to some degree of selfdiscrimination they could differentiate themselves from the environment around them they have inside them in some chemical form a crude preconscious sense of themselves I call things like that a first wave selfie first wave selfies are unintentional automatic or accidental resemblances something makes of itself in whole or in part like prehistoric human Footprints or the mental images animals have of their own bodies the first big leap in selfie history the second wave began with the first intentional depictions of oneself second wave selfies include everything from Chauvet caves 32 000 year old hand stencil prints to the paintings of Jan Von Ike and Judith leister but in the 19th century selfdepiction changed in another Major Way a technology emerged that allowed likenesses of the self to be made faster and with less skill that seemed more accurate less mediated and more indexical than ever before photography ushered in the third wave selfie in the fall of 1839 outside his familys lamp and chandelier store in Philadelphia thirtyyearold Robert Cornelius stood completely still for about 15 minutes in front of a camera he built using a modified opera glass and a sheet of silver plated copper the result was a significant image it could be found on his gravestone in Philadelphias Laurel Hill Cemetery the Smithsonian calls it the first selfie but they also dont in that same fall of 1839 a man named Henry Fitz Jr took a photograph of himself in Baltimore Smithsonian Magazine and pretty much everyone else has called corneliuss Selfie the first but in their archives the Smithsonian calls Fitz Juniors the first the reason for this confusion is that honestly we dont know which of these came first all we can be sure of is that neither of them is the first equally by r a Frenchman wrote of taking a photo of himself in 1837 two years before these but its been lost and other even earlier examples may have been lost as well because these are photographs people took of themselves its largely uncontroversial to call them selfies but you know theyre not like selfie selfies if youve seen my video is cereal soup you know what I just did there contrastive Focus reduplication thats when you repeat a word in order to focus on prototypical examples in contrast to edge cases for example we went on a date last night but you know it wasnt a date date in that statement Im contrasting what I did last night which might have been a date to a true date date which is obviously a date okay anyway the point is no one called these selfies when they were taken they were photographic selfportraits the word selfie wouldnt even exist for another 160 years after they were taken so at some point between this and this our relationship to selfdepiction changed and our vocabulary had to expand to discuss it what rough Beast emerged to make the coining of selfie necessary well lets keep going around 1846 Czech photographer MV lobethal took the earliest known selfie with a mirror this of course would become a classic selfie technique mirrors provided an easy early way to capture the self with a camera but in my opinion this mirror selfie from around 1900 is the most arresting I think you die at least three times once when your body stops living again usually sometime later when your name is spoken for the last time but now thanks to photography more and more of us are able to save ourselves from the third the last time and image of you is seen the identity of this woman is unknown that makes it the oldest known selfie taken by a person whose name we have forgotten this is the oldest known example of the classic outstretched arm selfie technique it was taken by Joseph Byron in 1909 images like these were a significant step toward the eventual fourth wave selfie the presence of a camera or arms or poles in the shot evidence of how it was made are Hallmarks of the modern day selfie stereotype for example a 2013 ad campaign for the cape times reimagined famous historical photographs as selfies and in every single one an arm connecting the subject to the camera was used five years after Byrons armed selfie Anastasia nikolivino Romanova the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and greatgranddaughter to Britains queen Victoria and Prince Albert took this photo of herself she was 13 years old at the time so many have claimed it to be the first selfie ever taken by a teenager but thats not true in 1852 61 years earlier British chemist William Henry Perkin took this photo of himself when he was just 14 however even though Anastasia wasnt the first teenager to take a selfie in another way she was unlike Perkins whose shot feels like a selfportrait she took pictures that feel much more like we today would call selfies the photos she took were personal she sent them to friends to share her mood and daily life here she is posing with fake novelty teeth in 1915 or 16 four years after taking this famous selfie her camera was confiscated and not long after Bolshevik revolutionaries executed her and her entire family together in a basement conclusive evidence of her death in 1918 wasnt uncovered until 2007 although her work was cut short she pioneered the use of Photography as a social behavior as a way to communicate not just commemorate she has been called the Kardashian of her day but despite her influence she was more of a trendsetter for hairstyles than photography she didnt usher in a worldwide shift in Behavior where young people everywhere started taking selfies camera manufacturers didnt rush to make selfportraiture easier and articles werent written about how great or how scary it was that young people were taking pictures of themselves though the modern day selfie still wasnt born it continued to gestate and kick within the womb one such kick was the use of sticks and pulls to activate a cameras shutter in 1925 newlyweds Arnold and Helen Hogg used a long Pole to take this picture in 1934 Helmer Larson used a fallen tree branch to snap this selfie with his wife naime in Sweden on Reddit Chooch 37 shared his grandfather using a selfie stick in the late 1940s heres one from 1957 and going back to 1920 heres Joseph Byron taking a handheld photograph with others I mentioned this image because a second camera captured how it was taken giving us an early depiction of what is now the recognizable human selfie pose now what I think makes this image so significant is that its another early Taste of the selfie as we know it today as Jins rushitz pointed out in exploring the selfie if you Google selfportrait you get a lot of selfportraits theres only one image that shows someone making a selfportrait Norman Rockwells famous triple selfportrait but if you Google selfie a lot of what you get arent selfies theyre pictures of people taking selfies four the selfie as we know it today the pose of taking one is just as if not more Salient than the actual result blogs and articles containing outrage over people taking selfies in inappropriate places or when they should be behaving differently rarely complain about the actual images they dislike the performance in 2015 Joanne paternapatania published a book of pictures of people taking selfies from which she had removed the environment giving us what feel like selfie poses preserved in specimen jars the idea that those taking photos can be a nuisance didnt begin with selfies far from it theres a long tradition of photographers especially tourists raising eyebrows for being annoying centering themselves over the location and being predictably heard like for example the Pisa pushers found in Italy the modern day selfie that was to come however makes a person look like a tourist everywhere they go not because everything suddenly became a landmark but because people have always loved looking at themselves and as cameras became smaller and easier to handle it was inevitable that people would start snapping more selfportraits Vivian Dorothy Meyer took really cool mirror selfies in the 1950s and 60s but she kept them to herself her selfies were unknown and unpublished during her lifetime a couple of years before her death she failed to make payments on a storage unit she rented and her Works were auctioned off six months after her death in 2009 a collector who had acquired them uploaded her images to Flickr and they went viral inspiring exhibitions a documentary a road in Paris was even named after her the popularization of instant cameras in the 60s and 70s made taking selfies physically and mentally easier you didnt need to know how to develop the film yourself or feel selfconscious turning in selfies to be developed but instant cameras with mirrors on the front didnt come around until decades later selfies still hadnt reached a Tipping Point in 1969 Michael Collins took the first reverse selfie a photograph that contains everyone but yourself Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are in this Lander right here and every human living or dead at that time is on this ball of Rock Only Collins himself behind the lens is absent in 1983 Hiroshi wada submitted a patent for a telescopic extender for supporting a compact camera an early selfie stick and two years prior Lester wisbrod started what was to become a personal tradition using his new auto focusing compact camera to snap selfies with famous people whiz broad was the pioneer of the celebrity selfie still though no one was using the word selfie selfies hadnt become a thing yet but then something happened in Japan in 1995 19 year old toshikawa haromi known as hero mix was nominated for the new Cosmos of Photography award by world renowned photographer Nobi Yoshi araki she submitted a portfolio of snapshots shed taken of her daily life and she won the grand prize there was already a unique culture of photo diary and photo booth use among young people in Japan but hero mixs sudden Fame amongst teenagers and the educated Elite made the practice a thing suddenly young people all over Japan wanted to be like her the New York Times called it hero mix syndrome increased demand for cameras that made selfportraiture and protoinstagramming easier LED camera manufacturers to speed up the release of features that served immediate frequent photography hero mix took a lot of photos tens of thousands and her work generated polarized reactions some critics adored her While others found it all baffled now by the time selfies were called selfies the same debate was started again but it was a about the behavior hero mix had brought into focus more than a decade before you know its hard to say who took the first selfie but in my opinion hero mix took the first selfie selfie her work hastened and christened the arrival of the fourth wave selfie the selfie as we know it today now if it hadnt been her it would have been someone else people love looking at themselves and it was becoming easier and easier to do so but hero mix popularized taking pictures of yourself as a social sharing activity more akin to speaking than remembering less a memory than a message nowhere is this more clear than in the story of the first camera phone picture on June 11 1997 while his wife was in labor Philippe Khan Jerry rigged together a makeshift system involving his star attack flip phone a Casio QV and a Toshiba laptop when his daughter was born he took a photo with the camera and used the laptop and phone connection to immediately email the image to more than 2 000 people social media is strongly associated with the fourth wave selfie but as weve seen it wasnt its origin instead social media was simply a mouth that showed up later and demanded to be fed them online we have no bodies we cant just walk in and be seen we have to upload images of our bodies for them to be there selfies are an easy solution because they dont require other peoples help but on top of that theres a sense in which a photo of yourself taken by someone else is that persons point of view its their story but a selfie well a selfies point of view doesnt belong to another person when I look at a selfie of you Im not a third Observer looking at you through someone elses eyes its just me looking at you selfies allow us to be online first hand not second hand in the same way that brown bears who migrated to the cold lands of the north evolved pale guard hairs and became polar bears as humans migrated into the cold lands of the screen they evolved selfies by 2006 everyone knew that something was happening the New York Times published an article that year about how young people were suddenly taking a lot of photos of themselves was it weird what did it mean not once in the article is the word selfie used but it could have been because sometime between 1995 and 2006 the word selfie was born selfie with a Y had been a word since the 1600s it meant selfcentered or selfish but selfie with an ie is new the earliest recorded usage of it is from a September 13 2002 post on Dr Carls selfserve science Forum Australian Nathan hope uploaded an image he took of how busted up his lip had gotten and he wrote sorry about the focus it was a selfie hope has been hailed as the inventor of the word selfie but says himself that he probably heard it somewhere else first which is likely the word selfie is a hypocrism a pet name an affectionate familiar cuter version of an existing word Australians are famous for doing this barbecue Barbie mosquito mozzie Australian Aussie selfportrait selfie they dont only use IE they love o s and Z too Australian English has given us probs Rando totes saws preggers and yes even doggo Myspace was an early incubator of thriving selfie colonies but in 2004 when Facebook launched as a serious social media platform for people at Elite universities there was a brief feeling that selfies were falling out of favor however when the iPhone 4 debuted with a frontfacing camera in 2010 the selfie was declared officially back in 2013 usage of the word selfie had jumped 17 000 percent in the last year and Oxford dictionaries declared it the word of the year everyone knew what a selfie was we started calling things that existed before the word selfies as well but that is an anachronym a word used out of place in time anachronyms can be words that have lingered around too long like when we say were dialing a number on a smartphone even though actual turning dials are no longer involved or when we call this tinfoil although its actually the cheaper and more durable aluminum foil that superseded it anachronyms can also be words from today like selfie that barge back into the past like calling these medieval Church singers the first boy band nailing down the definition of a selfie in the modern sense is tricky of course does a selfie need to be a photograph if not why if so do I need to be holding the camera does the use of a timer or a drone Im not even touching mean that its not a selfie or just a different kind of selfie are humans a selfie since God made us in His image because of questions like that I prefer what Ive been doing in this video just allow a selfie to mean anything that something has made that resembles itself or part of itself that covers a lot of stuff but can be broken down into four waves first wave selfies are unintentional the second wave began with the first deliberate depictions of oneself the third with photographys promise of recognizable selfdepictions that were significantly more accessible the fourth wave is when selfies became a thing a cultural phenomenon motivated by a desire not just to have images but to be images throughout the 20th century especially we found ourselves increasingly surrounded by images news and travels and products and stories the entire world outside our head could be seen like never before not in person but through images in the midst of this image world was the human animal an organism that got to look at images but wasnt one which was too bad because to be an image was to be something well selfies gave us that power they put it in our own hands photography allows more of us than ever before to delay the third death but the fourth wave selfie flattens the boundaries of time and space now we can be anywhere whenever does my face need to be depicted for it to be a selfie well in October of 2013 Kim Kardashian posted this image on Instagram within a month belfie had been added to the Urban Dictionary a belfie is a selfie of your butt but selfie selfie belfie guides and histories and even a belfie stick soon followed and this all raises a serious question about Society if a selfie of your butt is called a belfie shouldnt a selfie of your face be called a filthy and as always thanks for

the 70s did people used to look older Brandon McCarthy asked on Twitter and evidence poured in people shared photos of their parents in their early twenties their dad at 21 their mom at 18 or 19 their dad at 45 one user shared their husband at 27 and what his father looked like at 23 and theres pretty much an entire subculture around how old footballers looked decades ago 24 31 33 29 27 its not uncommon to think that theres something more grown up about the way people used to be to look back and think that people seemed older at a younger age than they do now lets call it retrospective aging it doesnt happen to everyone people do not and never have aged similarly and theres even the opposite observation that kids these days grow up too fast but its a popular question and subject of numerous memes so is it real or is it an illusion fueled by cherrypicked examples that feeds Rosy Nostalgia for a time when people were tough and didnt have it as easy as you kids have it now well as it turns out both humans today really are aging more slowly than their historic counterparts changes in lifestyle nutrition smoking habits Healthcare early life conditions and Skin Care particularly the use of sunscreen are a huge part of it by comparing measures of metabolic cardiovascular inflammatory kidney liver and lung function across time researchers at Yale and USC have found that we are in fact staying younger for longer than we used to so does that mean that 60 is the new 50 almost their results suggest that between the early 90s and the late 2000s 60 became the new 56 40 became the new 37 and a half and 20 became the new 19 oh also during the last century dentistry and Orthodontics have played a huge cosmetic role in the kinds of faces we see in parts of the world but interestingly when faces in magazines are measured from the 1930s to today the only significant change has been that across all ethnicities the media is now exposing us to larger lips also retroactive aging can occur over short time spans when I was a freshman the seniors in my high school seemed so old to me by the time I was a senior myself I looked in the mirror and at my peers and I was like we are them now but we dont seem as old as they did whats going on isnt just about bodies first of all the seniors I looked at when I was a freshman truly were older than me at that time they graduated and went away and later when I was a senior I saw myself as I was but in my minds eye I saw the earlier seniors as they appeared to me when I was younger retrospective aging seems to also be about perspective lets go back to this tweet this is George wimp playing Norm on the TV show Cheers now when cheers premiered went was indeed 34 but I looked it up and this image is actually from episode 24 of season 5 when Wint was 38 so were not comparing Apples to Apples here however this is an image of George went at 34 and Ashley Fairbanks made some alterations and a good point however heres the rub these alterations dont make Wint look more like a 34 year old they make him look more like a 34 year old today similarly giving the Golden Girls modern day hairstyles and makeup drops their apparent age a lot superficial Styles and mannerisms can often make not just a big difference but all the difference which supports the hypothesis that retrospective aging is often an illusion modes of selfexpression are always changing clothing hairstyles accessories makeup mannerisms language body language now modes can come back but never exactly the context is always a little bit different and from whats available or acceptable at any one time we each draw ways of appearing or being in the world and even if you dont care about how you look or think about how you act what options you even have are dictated by whats currently popular or normal or being pushed on people like you few of us stay at the stream drawing whats new all our lives for various reasons we often wander away with our catch perhaps its because we settle into an identity were comfortable with or fear the taboo of not dressing our age or simply run out of time to care but when were gone the stream keeps changing and we get older and continue to use the mannerisms and styles we grabbed a while back eventually to whatever those Styles initially evoked a new connotation is added old person not because the look or behavior is intrinsically for the elderly but because those who use it us became old ourselves if you want to look older what do you do well you can dress the way older people dress and the thing is thats often how they used to dress too we think people looked older in the past because they look the way old people do today Dale Irby a gym teacher at Prestonwood Elementary School in Dallas Texas posed for his first yearbook photo in 1973 the following year he accidentally wore the same outfit again he says he was embarrassed at first but his wife Kathy challenged him to do it again so he did and he never stopped what he gave us is a great exaggerated example of how what once connoted youth comes to be associated with old age the people we keep seeing a style on get older and older themselves until we think of the style itself as being for old people retrospective aging then is double pronged both real and illusory people in the past really did age faster than us because of differences in nutrition and lifestyle and medicine but much if not most can be chalked up to the fact that we think people like this are dressed like old people but thats an anachronism theyre dressed like old people from the future the old people they would become has anyone ever dressed like a young person from the future well it happened in 1941 at the reopening of the South Fork bridge in Canada a crowd came out to celebrate and photos were taken in 2010 the photos were digitized and placed online thats when this guy was noticed a time traveling hipster why a time traveler wouldnt bother to blend in and why with all of history to visit he chose the reopening of a bridge in the 40s no one knew the photo was confirmed to be undoctored and researchers put forward the idea that this man was not in fact a time traveler that his shirt wasnt an ironic screen print but simply bore the logo of the Montreal Maroons a nearby hockey team at the time they said his sunglasses and knit sweater were not unusual for the 40s nor was his portable camera the only thing that was unusual about him was how casual his attire was and theyre probably right but this all raises the exciting possibility that someone out there right now possibly even you is unknowingly dressed like people in the future will and your appearance in photos will someday freak them out you know it might be fun to start dressing even more casually or in some other odd way on the off chance that you happen to nail it and years from now you are worshiped as a time traveler oh that reminds me of todays sponsor

Justin or a josh pause right now if youd like to think about it according to research from Millsaps College in Miami University this is Mark or at least this is what we think people named Mark look like by asking people to make and rate digitally created faces researchers were able to put together prototypical faces for a number of different names this is apparently what we think a Josh looks like a bill a Justin a Dan a Brian a Tom and Andy the idea that names might conjure certain face shapes in our minds isnt that strange for example theres Wolfgang Kohlers famous finding that when asked which of these shapes is named buba and which is named Kiki people of all different ages and cultures and languages overwhelmingly assign Kiki to the spiky one and buba to the Blobby one and sure enough it certainly seems to work with names too which one of these men is Tim and which is Bob well almost unanimously people feel like this is Tim and this is Bob but are these men actually named Tim and Bob well theres the rub just because we associate certain names certain sounds with certain shapes doesnt mean were right theres no such thing as a biological name if a person still goes by the same name they were given as a baby long before anyone knew what they would look like as an adult well surely there wont be a connection but as it turns out there is believe it or not in a multiple choice setting people can guess a strangers name just by looking at their face more often than we would expect from luck alone its called the face name matching effect heres a stimulus from zwebners research this man is named Jacob Dan Joseph or Nathaniel by just randomly picking a name people should get this right 25 of the time but zwebner found that people picked the correct answer Dan nearly 40 percent of the time whats going on can names actually cause us to grow to look a certain way well apparently they can it has been called a Dorian Gray effect in Oscar Wildes The Picture of Dorian Gray a portrait of the protagonist ages and grotesquely reflects his evil Deeds while he himself remains young and pure looking in a similar way it seems that in some cases our own appearance can come to reflect the name we were given but I kind of think its really more of a reverse story and gray effect I mean in the book dorians reality affects the appearance of his portrait but the face name matching effect goes the other way a inanimate sign a name influences our actual physical appearance well anyway its not news that a persons name can lead others to have certain expectations of them and treat them accordingly its been found for example that multiracial faces given European names are rated as looking more European than the same faces are when presented with noneuropean names the expectations a name carries with it may create a selffulfilling prophecy whereby as a person grows up theyre motivated to fulfill those expectations carry themselves in ways people think someone with their name should and even like dislike accentuate hide use and avoid different parts of their face and body depending on whether or not those parts match their name its been found that faces and names that match are emotionally liked more than faces and names that dont analysis of voting data has shown that senatorial candidates earn 10 more votes when their names fit their faces very well then when they fit very poorly now with that in mind part of the effect could literally come from the fact that although parents dont know what their kid will look like as an adult the parents do know what they look like and without knowing it tend to prefer names that match their faces which are likely to resemble their childs face as well but not always if the dissonance is too great a person can always change their name either completely or by simply choosing a nickname if I had been just a little bit different I Michael could have always gone by Mike the fact that people can adjust their names to fit them of course merely strengthens the face name matching effect by studying whether the correct name could be guessed when different parts of a face were occluded researchers were able to develop heat maps showing which parts of the face different names are most characteristically associated with apparently looking like an an is all about the tip of the nose its the bridge of the nose for Arthurs and the philtrum or snot trough for Benjamins aurelis are recognized by their face spiders lets go back to old people how old is an old person 737 thats according to results published in the Journal of American geriatrics last year its the average age people gave when asked when does old age begin people under 65 on average said 71 and people over 65 on average said 77 women said old age began three years later than men did white people said it began eight years later than nonwhites did and people who felt healthy placed old age later in life than those who felt less healthy but how old do people want to be well that depends on how old they already are in America the only people who are the age they would like to be are 21 year olds well younger than 21 wish they were older and people older than 21 wish they were younger people who are 40 wish they were 30 people who are 60 wish they were 40 and people who are 90 wish they were 60 when people are asked if they could be one age forever the average American picks 36 which is actually how old I am right now funny enough heres something else thats funny old people are more likely to think they dream in black and white not because its part of the aging process but because they are veterans of the great black and white dream epidemic of the 20th century prior to the 1900s Aristotle Descartes Freud everyone who wrote about the topic reported that dreams contained color but as Humanity moved into the 20th century the number of people reporting color in their dreams dropped just as quickly as the popularity of new black and white movies and TV rows by the 60s as color TV and movies became more and more common reports of colored dreams started going back up and today people who grew up with black and white TV continue to report more black and white dreams than those who didnt and later studies across China found the same thing the frequency of black and white dreaming correlated strongly with how common black and white TV was in a persons area so did black and white movies and TV literally change our dreams well first of all its not clear whether dreams themselves actually changed or if people just started thinking differently about their dreams were trying but we still havent found a way to get direct access to dream content Erics switchgeible has pointed out that as far as we know dreams may not be in color or black and white or sepia or anything they may be primarily indeterminate in color as they happen and only later during recall do we confabulate details about color he Compares dreaming to reading is a novel in color or black and white as you read a story what do you see in your mind it might be the case that dreams vaporous as they are are something we simply have a terrible grip on and that movies and TV shows have given us the illusion of understanding them in fact switchable has speculated that smells and touch Sensations are rare in dreams today but future people with smelly touchyfeely VR shows might think that they dream with lots of textures and odors and find it strange maybe even frightening that few of us seem to but why would we think that dreams were like moving pictures and not normal Waking Life well no one knows it might be that motion pictures are just simply the closest thing we have to dreaming that isnt dreamy unlike still images paintings photographs tapestries Motion Pictures and dreams can contain movement and narrative and cause and effect and unlike stage plays or real life Motion Pictures and dreams are not made of anything that is even remotely similar to what they depict theyre both made of phantoms images are uncanny things a person in an image is Frozen in time but yet can seem to grow old our own image can depend on what we are called and theyre the closest thing we have to what our mind does when were away do you get the picture or does the picture get you and

Do Chairs Exist?,2021-09-14T13:30:21Z,37.9,11657045,575052,Hey Vsauce Michael here And here Michael here hey vsauce what is here … what is there what is there What REALLY exists Do waves exist or are there just things thatare wavy When does a piece of food I’ve eaten stopbeing food and become me Do chairs exist Ontology is the philosophy of existence And chairs are what philosophers call ORDINARYOBJECTS Ordinary objects are the plain old commonsense things we deal with every day spoons buckets rocks stuff like that Their existence is as obvious as possible but the more we try to sus out where theyare the more sus they become First of all sure this could all be a dream Maybe we’ve all been hallucinating chairsall these years Or this could part of the simulated realitypumped into our brains while our bodies are harvested for energy But underneath that skepticism there’s adeeper ONTOLOGICAL question that we need to answer first Regardless of whether this spoon is made ofreal atoms or simulated atoms is it really possible to be “made of” something Take a look at these two things As we all know two minus one is … TWO There ARE two things here An origami crane AND a piece of paper I’m kidding of course there’s reallyjust one the crane and the piece of paper are the same But watch this Where’d the crane go If the paper and the crane were truly identicalthey would share everything in common But clearly they don’t the paper can survivebeing unfolded the crane cannot Also I made the crane but I didn’t makethe paper And the paper was around before the crane For two things that are the same they sureare different This relationship is called CONSTITUTIONpaper constitutes the crane It’s a onetoone relationship but there’sanother kind of “being made of” going on here too This paper is made not of ONE other thingbut of sextillions of things fundamental subatomic particles electrons and quarksor strings or physical and virtual fields This manytoone relationship is called COMPOSITION Philosophers call whatever it is that matteris ultimately composed of SIMPLES a simple is a thing that unlike a piece of paperhas no parts No substructure Not even a top or bottom It could be the case that there are no simplesthat there’s just a neverending chain of smaller and smaller substructure Philosophers call such a reality a GUNKY universe If structure never ends in the other directionand everything turns out to be part of something bigger with no final complete composite that’swhat’s known as a JUNKY universe Point is believing ordinary objects existand are made up of smaller things is quite common It’s called ontological reductionism It’s the position that wholes are NOTHINGMORE than their parts But our cranes and our paper challenge that notionit seems like being MADE OF some things IS different than just BEING those things Let’’s agree on what it means to exist Let’s say that for something to exist issimply for there to be more than zero of it Pegasus exists if we mean “are there anywinged horses in works of fiction and mythology” And pegasus does not exist if we mean “arethere any physical fleshandblood winged horses that evolved on Earth through naturalselection” okay so if we can agree on that then of course chairsexist There’s this one right here I can see it and feel it and taste it yea It’s dry and  a little bit salty Dry and salty are what we call PROPERTIES Properties tell us what things are LIKE For example this slice of cheese is FLOPPY By noticing and sharing properties we canlet each other know what to expect from things And we all more or less agree on what thingsthere are We give names to stuff and if they catch onwe put them in dictionaries with the word “noun” next to them But are all of these nouns an inventory ofthe universe … or an inventory of things we MADE Let me put it this way do islands exist Well it’s in the dictionary and a quicklook around confirms that there are more than zero islands so yes Islands exist But what about incars An incar is a car that is IN a garage As a car leaves a garage an incar diminishesat the threshold until it collapses into nonexistence Later an extremely similar incar may emergeat the same threshold when the car returns Are there any cars in garages right now If so then incars exist You might be thinking “that’s not a thing you just made that up And it’s silly “being in a garage”is just a property that a car can have Stop trying to make incars a thing” Ok first of all I didn’t make it up EliHirsch did And second of all if you think incars aren’tthings wait till you hear about islands An incar might just be a relation betweena car and a garage but an island is just a relation between land and some water Now “island” might be a more useful conceptthan “incar” but does that make islands OBJECTIVELY more real than incars And what about trogs A trog is an object whose parts are a treeand whatever dog is nearest Here’s a picture of one Do you see the trog this is its tree partand this is its dog part You might be thinking come on how can THATbe a thing The tree and the dog aren’t even connected well so what These two pieces of fabric aren’t connectedand yet they’re a thing called a bikini Now sure if we cut down this tree and burnit for warmth we wouldn’t feel the need to apologize to what’s left of the trogfor destroying its tree part But maybe we should What if some extraterrestrials showed up andsaid they thought dogs and trees composed trogs — would they be wrong Could we convince the otherwise Ontological realists believe that we could That there really is a mindindependent answerto the question “what is there” People like Theodore Sider believe that theuniverse has “joints” and we can cut up reality up into objective real things by findingthem Ontological antirealists disagree Their position is that what we think thereis is just one way to cut up reality It’s a good one for us and our needs butit’s not objectively more true than any other So who’s right Hmm… well if these blocks composea tower … what do they compose now Just because we don’t have a name for  thisdoesn’t necessary mean that I haven’t accidentally built something Does it When DO two or more things compose somethingelse Peter Van Inwagen calls this the special compositionquestion In MATERIAL BEINGS he considers possible answersmaybe things compose something only when they’re in contact That’s a good thought but it doesn’texplain how a BIKINI can be a thing Or why two books are still just two bookswhen one is stacked on top of the other you know Maybe a certain degree of FIXATION is required Or a ‘melding’ … if a surgeon sewedus together and the skin healed with no seam and we shared the same blood supply … youknow even then it would seem wrong to say that we’d become some new kind of animal There’d still just me and you But like stuck together The philosophy of parts and wholes is calledmereology and Mereological Universalism is the belief thatthere’s an answer to the special composition question and the answer is this any assortment of stuff no matterhow strange or scattered across time and space composes a thing some pages compose these books but I dont just have two books here Oh no theres also a third thing lets call it a took because its parts are Two Books There is also something composed of my left earthe northern third of every brown trout in England and the Eiffel tower Just because it has no name and no one’sever talked about it before just shows a lack of intrest on our parts To a universalist eliminating some compositesbut not others is just too arbitrary We may as well accept them all Eliminativism is any belief that accepts somecomposites but eliminates others Peter Van Inwagen for example believes thatthere are no ordinary objects no chairs or shirts or shoes Right here there are just some simples — atoms or whatever— arragned showwise There isnt something else here called a shoe But he thinks that because people believethey themselves exist and he can’t see how something could believe it existed withoutexisting in the first place to even think that there must be people He goes further though to argue that ALLliving thigns exist While admiting he doesn’t have any “knockdown”agruments in their favor he mentions that because simples that are part of a livingorganism maintain the organism —  — while shedding some members and gainingothers all while remaining individuated from other organisms unlike say waves of waterat the moment of collision clearly simples in the act of a life must compose something That position is ORAGANICISM It’s been called the belief that peopleexist but that none of them wear clothes Mereological Nihilism is less generous It’s the belief that there aren’t anytrogs or incars OR dogs or trees Because nothing ever composes The nihilist doesn’t believe that thereis NOTHING here There are lots of simples but that’s it That might sound puzzling how can a bunchof fundamental particles arranged into atoms and molecules that are arranged like thisNOT be a chair That’s JUST IS what a chair is Good question Let’s call that deflationism the beliefthat this is all silly and that all of these positions are talking past each other theyall agree on what reality contains they all believe that there are simples here and thatthose simples are arranged in a chair shape Since that’s just what a chair IS theyall believe in chairs Those who say they don’t just being weirdand contrarian Deflationism has many supporters And it truly is the heart of our issue today But to address it we should first see whyit would be nice if all of these parts did not form a chair Let’s begin with overdetermination Ifchairs really do exist shouldn’t they be able to interact with us The thing is though everything this allegedchair can do can be described by referencing the behavior of simples here and any other simplesthat come along An account of the activities of every ATOM in this room leaves nothing for the chair to explain Composites are causally redundant Believing in chairs is like believing thatwhile yes the burning gas from my stove completely describes why the water in a pot boils there’sALSO a magical invisible substance called boilo that comes out of my stove that doesthe same thing as the flame at the same time and if there was no boilo the flame wouldwarm the water just the same but there is boilo Chairs are no more real than boilo Composites overdetermine what happens in the world They also lead to overCOUNTING For more on that let’s say hello to thisvideo’s sponsor Hi I’m Michael Stevens You may know me from such films as ”LadyGaga  Judas PARODY Key Of Awesome 42” and The Emoji Movie But today I’m here to talk to you aboutthe Curiosity Box This season subscribers will be receivingmany things including a shirt celebrating the Sherman line a kit to find out what bacteriais growing on you a puzzle that celebrates the average color of neptune and yes uranusand the first ever athome demonstration of impossible colors And right now if you subscribe with code BOGO we’llalso send you our entire summer box  completely free just pay shipping How many THINGS will you be receiving forone ridiculously low price You might think 15 8 things plus 7 things   But don’t forget that you’re ALSOgetting this entire collection and THIS entire collection That’s 17 things ORder now That’s a good deal but the ontology seemedwrong If I count some parts I shouldn’t alsocount the whole they compose But if you believe in composite objects youMUST do this right After all the composite exists So if this chair contains say 100 sextillionatoms then there are actually AT LEAST 100 sextillion and one things here all of theseatoms and also a chair That seems wrong but wait there’s more If I take a knife and scrape off a tiny partof this chair … is it still a chair I think most of us would say yes It would still be a chair even if I removeda tiny bit again And again A series of tiny innocuous removals is calleda SORITES SEQUENCE The trouble they cause is that while it seemswe must accept that each individual step doesn’t annihilate the chair clearly ENOUGH minuteremovals WILL eventually leave us with no chair Nothing at all in fact But how can that be How subtracting zero over and over again EVERgive a different result Clearly there must be a point at which atiny change DOES make a difference Different people might give different answersas to where that line is — but you know we could just stipulate the boundaries wecould define “chair” in some extreamly precise way If we did that if we defined the shape functionhistory and use that makes something a chair so precisely that the even the smallest deviationwould make or break its status as a chair … how could we know if it’d done it right If we called up God and said “hey dudewatch this see this chair Okay now we’re going to remove a singleatom from it Ta da It’s no longer a chair is it” Would God would be like “pwha Correct you guys nailed it That is exactly right It was a chair before and now in my infinitewisdom I can confirm that that single atom was what made the difference” Unless there’s some explanation for whya boundary should be drawn in a precise way instead of some other way our stipulationsare just arbitrary Ordinary objects may be unredeemably vague But being vague may actually be a feature of ordinaryobjects For example how many people is a crowd 10 people standing together in a huge emptypark might be more of a group but 10 people standing further apart in a tiny waiting roomwill feel way more CROWDED The fact that our terms depend on contextthat they’re PLASTIC make it seem less and less like they’re describing THINGSand more and more like they’re pragmatic That rather than telling what there is theytell us to expect Peter Unger has pointed out that there’sat least one kind of thing that CAN survive a sorities sequence without paradox stuff If you innocuously remove pieces from somethingthat is just “some stuff” you will still have some stuff after each step until youreach a clear and unambiguous boundary when the last piece is removed there will no longerbe any stuff This might show that there ARE composite objectsstuff As soon as we pretend that some stuff is aTHING though vagueness sets in Suddenly we’re talking about a thing thatcan lose parts but also can’t lose parts and unless contradictions can exist wordslike “chair” don’t really refer to any thing in the universe Sorites seqeunces lead to other problemstoo Like the PROBLEM OF THE MANY If removing a tiny number of atoms from this chair stillleaves me with a chair how many chairs are here I mean there’s this one And then there’s this one which is really similar to the first but doesnt have these atoms on top of it I don’t even have to remove atoms for thisto be a problem All I have to do try to define which atomshere are part of the chair and which aren’t At the atomic level there isn’t a definiteboundary Near the edge it will hard to tell whethera particular molecule is part of the moisture in the chair or part of the ambient humidity Instead of there being a single chair hereit seems like REALLY there are billions and billions of candidates for the chair Which one is the chair But now suppose that instead of removingpieces like in a sorities sequences or choosing pieces like in the problem of the many weinstead discard pieces and replace them with new similar pieces This is the set up to the famous SHIP OF THESEUSparadox Suppose I buy a boat and name it THESEUS Over time parts of the boat wear out andI replace them with brand new parts After say 10 years I might realize thatnot a single part of my boat was part of the boat on the day I bought it Do I now own a different boat Have I owned TWO boats But now suppose the someone has been followingme all these years and has been picking up each old part I throw out and storing themin a warehouse After I replaced all the original parts theytake them and join them back the way they way there were 10 years ago Which boat is THESEUS Both If we conclude that ordinary objects don’texist the problems of sorites the many theseus overdetermination and overcountingall evaporate If there are only simples and they never composeanything then which one is the ship of theseus is easy to answer neither Neither are the boat and nothing ever wasthe boat All that happened was that some simples gotmoved around The simples the scavenger has are the simplesI possessed when I bought the boat but there’s no mystery of persistence removing or exchanginga piece of stuff never left me with the same stuff There’s no mystery as to which of the billionsof chair candidates here is THE chair and the removal of no specific atoms will everstop it from being a chair because it there is no chair here and there never was There are only simples arranged chairwise The illusion that there ARE compositesthat can survive changes in parts is an artifact of our minds It’s a helpful one that allows us to trackcertain properties and ignore others but when taken seriously it obviously isn’treally how the universe works And that’s okay We shouldn’t be embarassed when we talkabout boats or chairs Our words for ordinary objects really do referto actual phenomena and therefore are more correct than believing that say the sunturned into a black hole yesterday Unlike the false statement that chairs existthere is NO evidence saying the sun turned into a black hole yesterday could even beINCORRECTLY describing Because of this Trenton Merricks calls thebelief in ordinary objects false but “nearly as good as true” This is all silly though right Of course there are chairs If you believe that there are some simplesarranged chairwise then you admit that there’s a chair Because that’s just what a chair IS It’s not some additional THING overandabovethese simples it just IS them Each is still an atom or electron or whateverbut TOGETHER they are a chair Not so fast there chairlover   What do you MEAN “a chair IS simples arrangedchairwise” the phrase “simples arranged chairwise”just picks out these simples There’s nothing else for that phrase torefer to There aren’t all of these simples and thenALSO some OTHER simples that are the simples arranged chairwise So do you mean that “chair” is a disguisedplural That it refers to lots of things like thephrase “these books” Because “these books” only commits usto the existence of this book and this book but not an additional singleobject that’s called a “these books” Likewise if “chair” just means this simpleand this simple and this simple then it points to a whole bunch of things and not one ofthem is a chair Sure “chairs” exist if by chair we meana word for all these simples But if by chair we mean an actual object inthe universe there just aren’t any my friend Except… maybe there is no chair overandabovethe simples but instead something happens when an assortment of simples are arrangedinto a chairshape Each member continues to be a single atomor whatever but COLLECTIVELY they all simultaneously BECOME one thing a chair Okay so then either there’s no chair herejust simples or somehow a miraculous contradiction has appeared many things and ALSO one thingthat despite both clearly differing in that respect are still identical It looks like chairs can’t be identicalto the parts they’re supposedly composed of but chairs also can’t be DIFFERENT fromtheir composite parts because there’s nothing else there and after counting and accountingfor their parts there’s nothing left for the existence of a chair to cause or explain To rescue chairs from nonexistence we needto find a way to show that a chair is independent of its atoms — and therefore distinct fromthem — but not SO distinct that it’s impossibly overandabove them We need to find a way to make chairs ONTOLOGICALLYINNOCENT To have our cake and not have it too Amie Thomasson does this in a very cleverway She points out that if I ask you “heyis there anything in the fridge” and you open it see that’s it empty and say “there’snothing in here” it would be weird if I came over looked inside found a single eyelashin the corner and said “ummm EXCUSE me What is this you said there was no THINGin the fridge but there was an eyelash and gosh dangit the whole things is actuallyFULL Of AIR” That would be weird because when I asked ifthere was anything in the fridge it was implied that I meant anything TO EAT By arguing that the empty fridge is not REALLYempty I was using the word “thing” in what Thomasson calls a “neutral sense” I used it to mean any and all entities thatcould possibly be described But you took me to be using “thing” inwhat she calls a “sortal” sense A sortal is a term that tells us what a thingis in way that allows us to count how many there are AND know when there is or isn’tone “Water” is not a sortal If I told you there was water in my basementand you asked “how many waters” I’d have to use a sortal to answer you For example “gallons of water” Thomasson argues that the neutral use of “thing”is meaningless when used to ask questions For example if I used thing in a neutral sense and asked how many orange things are in this video you would have no idea how I wanted you to carve it all up thus there would be no would be no single correct answer You might say uh one orange thing Your shirt But then I could say “what no theres my left sleeve my right sleeve the inside of the shirt the outside of the shirt Come on theres way more than one Unless we use a sortal net any search forwhat things there are will end in confusion Not because there are no things but becauseit hasn’t been made clear what conditions to apply when searching For Thomasson this means that what we finddepends on what APPLICATION CONDITIONS we use If I ask if there’s anything here that thecondition “smaller than a molecule” applies to you could note each such thing and giveme an inventory “Chair” would not be on the list But if I asked you if there were any mediumsizedrigidacordingto human strength things here “chair” would probably go on your listand no single atom would If an application condition is satisfied inthe wrold then the thing is descrbes exists So CHAIRS do exist If the application conditions for one thingare also sufficient for something else then if we find the first thing we have foundthe other because it’s existence is entailed ANLYTICALLY by the existence of the firstthing — that is by meaning and logic alone For example if I say that I live in a houseyou can conclude — without looking — that I live in a building There’s no paradox here I don’t livein a house AND a building — two distinct things that defy the laws of physics by beingcolocated Instead the conditions that apply to a houseare also sufficient for building So a single chair is not impossibly identicalto some collection of many Nor is it somehow overandabove its parts Instead atoms arranged chairwise merelylogically ENTAIL a chair The entailment connects things differentiatedby distinct application conditions When we ask which one is the ship of theseusa puzzle erupts because we’re being too neutral We need to say what we mean by “ship oftheseus” if we mean the original parts then this is it Do we mean the thing registered to me by theboat authorities well then it’s this one “But which is the REAL one” is an incompletepseudoquestion When it come to sorites sequences I thinkwe need to just stipulate where the boundary is I don’t think there’s an objective answerprovided by the universe or God as to exactly what is and isn’t a chair but that doesn’tHAVE to mean that there aren’t any chairs it can just mean that every single collectionof simples is it’s own unique object independent of our minds and that we get to decide whichwe will call chairs Vagueness comes from our minds and our languagebut there are no vague objects in the universe We don’t have to believe that our realityis simulated but I do think we have to believe that it’s stipulated it is a reality thatcontains not what intelligent machines have decided to give us but what we have decidedwe have There’s no fact of the matter as to whethercalling this a star is the TRUE way to carve up this stuff It’s a pretty useful way to do it and helpfulfor at least human purposes but “STAR” is a thing WE imposed on the world As Michael Jubien puts it “there are nothings but as a consequence there are as many things as we like” As for the problem of the many we can simplyjust admit that there really are billions of slightly different chairs here Some include a few boundary atoms that othersdon’t but since they all act and react pretty much in unison in our daily livesit doesn’t matter which exact material collection we mean when we say “this chair” However let’s go back to our cranes When we talked about holes we said that holesmight be ONTOLOGICALLY parasitic That their existence seems to require theexistence of something ELSE something that can HOST the hole Perhaps this crane is holey too Not a physical thing in its own right buta disturbance IN some paper There is no material crane here there isonly some paper that is arranged cranewise But once we start entertaining that notionwe realize that nearly EVERYTHING we see and feel all ordinary obejcts and even ourselves are ontological parasites Michael Jubien calls our tendency to thinkthat what is true of a “chair” is true of the material that is chairing OBJECT FIXATIONor PROPERTY REPRESSION Object fixation is useful and “nearly asgood as true” but when paradxoes loom we should remember that while chairs exist theyaren’t made out of matter and can’t be touched or or felt or tasted All I can do is taste some stuff while itchairs If it looks like a duck swims like a duckand quacks like a duck then it’s not a duck but it is arranged duckwise I think that the only concrete physical thingsin our universe are simples — or since our universe could be gunky — the materialworld only contains stuff And yes this stuff is chairing but theroad paved by the idea that that makes this stuff A chair leads to paradox To see how we could have made that mistakelet’s remember the famous Clintonian dictum that often “it depends on what the meaningof “is” is” There’s the “is” of predication whichtells us what some thing is like as in this cheese IS floppy And then there’s the “is” of identitywhich tells us what is the same as what for example 22 IS 4 To believe that chairs are made of matter— to be believe that YOU are made of matter — is to confuse these two ISes When a collection of properties are extremelythorough in telling us what to expect from some stuff we tend to just go ahead and NOUNthem collapse them into a single word and believe it doesn’t just describe some stuffbut REFERS to it I think we have an intuitive sense of thethoroughness of properties and this can be seen in how we order our adjectives “Big” can mean many things A big diamond and big house are very differentin size “Blue” tells me a bit more about whatto expect but CHEESEBURGER oooh that’s specific So specific in fact that we call it a noun This increasing thoroughness may be partlyresponsible for the fact that “big blue cheseburger” sounds fine but blue big cheeseburger”sounds kind of weird When we embrace the idea that cheseburgersare not physical objects but instead exist as an abstract set of properties like juicywarm soft and so on the specter of ontolgical paradox dissipates You and I are not physical objects either “Michaeling” is a bunch of differentproperties and most of them are very vague They include things like “knowing who Kevinis being more or less a certain height having a roughly continous relationship with thestuff that Mcihaeled yesterday and that that’s Michaeling today” and so Some of what it means to Michael does concerncomposition like the fact that I will still exist even if I shave off the stuff I callmy beard If I shaved off my beard there would stillbe some stuff Michaeling but it would be different stuff than before We’re able to lose parts and change andgrow because we aren’t made of matter we’re hosted by matter There’s no thing that is you and no thingthat is ME As Alan Watts would say the universe doesn’tcontain people the universe PEOPLES Chairs and tables and rocks and buckets and people are not made of atoms they are preformed by atoms We are disturbances in stuff and none of itis us This stuff right here is not me Its just meing We are not the universe seeing itself weARE the seeing

The Future Of Reasoning,2021-04-28T21:53:46Z,30.033333333333335,9286837,517765,The Future of Reasoning Hey Vsauce Michael here Where is your mind Is it in your head I mean that’s where your brain is — andyour brain remembers plans makes judgements solves problems … but you also rememberand plan with things like these and this And you solve problems and make judgementswith all sorts of other stuff too The more you think about it the more yourealize that while the brain is a wet lump of fat and protein no firmer than a globof tofu the MIND is something much larger it’s an everexpanding organ of tissue ANDwood and stone and steel And people Because of communication we can even makeOTHER PEOPLE extensions of our minds We can access their memories and perceptionsand knowledge by simply asking Or not I don’t need to learn how to fix a car ANDpractice medicine AND vulcanize rubber OR remember everything … other people are doingthat for me just as I do things for them We are a species of individuals that is alsoone big interdependent lumbering growth A frantic blur of flesh and concrete A ‘techno sapien’ powered by imaginationsand passions made real by a hallowed faculty we call REASON Reason it is said guides us to truer knowledgeand better decisions It’s allowed us to increase lifeexpectancysuffer less work together better and it’s bound to take us further and higher untilthe end of time Or is it The organ we USE to reason takes millionsof years to evolve but the fruits of reason grow rapidly and are ever accelerating In the next four decades we’re expectedto build the equivalent of another new york city every month More concrete was installed in the last twodecades outside the US than the US installed during the entire 20th century This growth means that quality of life aroundthe world is rising It means that electricity manufactured goodsfood comfort and transportation are all becoming more common and accessible But there are hints that reason and logicare struggling aginst the complexity of it all against our growing dependence on thethings we’ve built and their unintended consequences Nearly every part of life as we know it todayinvolves or relies on a process that releases molecules with lopsided electrical charges This property causes them to absorb and reemitthermal radiation pinging it around so that it escapes into space more slowly Having more warmer parcels of air means strongerweather events They can’t be pinned on any particular extremestorm but they make extreme storms in general more extreme and frequent What’s a stake isn’t just ‘bad weather’it’s disaster it’s more lives lost more property lost it’s more droughts morehunger more famine more people needing refuge and a even greater reliance on the very thingsthat caused the problems in the first place In total we release about 51 billion tonsof such gases every year and we need to release zero But how do you rethink … everything Who gets to direct the costs and tradeoffs How do you achieve collaboration between nearlyevery local and national government when what works in one place won’t work everywherewhen decisions effect jobs in one place and food in another When not just things need to be rethoughtbut also habits and traditions and values How do you achieve consensus when a problemisn’t obvious to the senses is far away in space and time requires solutions thataffect people in different ways and as a product of science always carries some uncertainty The philosopher Timothy Morton calls somethingso massively distributed in time and space and so viscous — so STICKY that it adheresto all that touch it a HYPEROBJECT Every civilizations that grows at the speedof reason must at some point face hyperobjects In fact the fact that we still haven’tfound evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth has been brought up as evidence thatsome sort of GREAT FILTER might exist that few civilizations manage to get past That a hyperobject like our impact on theplanet might be such a great filter is not a new idea What it’ll take to solve it is the topicof Bill Gate’s HOW TO AVOID A CLIMATE DISASTER And I decided to do this video in partnershipwith him and his team because the way we deal with hyperobjects reveals a lot about themind It’s easy — and common — to think thatwe would all be better off if everyone was just more rational But what if reasoning wasn’t built for whatwe’ve become Let’s begin by looking at behavioral inertia Behavioral inertia is the tendency to keepdoing what you’re already doing Status quo bias It can be a frustrating bias if you desirechange but its origin isn’t a flaw If an organism has managed to survive longenough to reproduce and provide and care for its offspring then the state of its worldwas sufficient for its genes to spread That’s all it takes to persist The types of organisms we see around us willnaturally be those that managed to persist and didn’t after reaching the point atwhich they could persist rock the boat too much Behavioral inertia can help slow down theaccumulation of unintended consequences and the loss of ideas that work but it can alsoslow down innovation and adaptation If the environmental impacts of our societywere more immediate and unignorable it wouldn’t be so tempting to apply this inertial brake But emissions are invisible and their consequencesaren’t immediate or local They impact future people and people far away Those who are different from us poorer thanus people we will never meet This may be one of the first challenges advancingcivilizations face weilding not just the power of technology and distributed cognitionbut also the responsibilities Extending not just the mind but also EMPATHYcould certainly be a great filter Our lower instincts may bias us but surelyREASON can help us navigate towards the future we want right Well what IS reason It’s a way of making inferences An inference is any new information extractedfrom the information you already have We make inferences all the time — everyliving thing does We don’t have measuringtape tentacles thatshoot from our eyes and what actually enters our brain is just a 2D image but our brainsnonetheless INFER depth by attending to cues like stereopsis occultation perspectiveparallax size… When this happens we accept it as reality We aren’t aware of the visual processingthat made it possible and don’t have to be If however we do consciously consider WHYa certain conclusion was reached then BOOM that’s REASONING Reasoning is the process of making inferencesnot automatically and instrinctively but by looking at facts and seeing what conclusionthey support When Eratosthenes calculated the circumferenceof the Earth to within a percentage or two of the value accepted today he didn’t doit by MEASURING the Earth and he didn’t just percieve it as selfevident he INFERREDit from what he knew about shadows and how long it took camels to move Stories like that make it easy to believethat reasoning evolved because it supercharged our abilities it clearly moves us towardstruer conclusions better decisions and knowledge no other species could infer Attempts to describe the rules of good orderlyreason became logic and mathematics concepts so general and abstract that while we werestill animals armed with them we were no longer beasts But that’s the rub isn’t it If reasoning is so great why are we the onlyspecies with such a sophisticated grasp of it And if its purpose is truth and good judgementwhy don’t we all agree on everything These questions make up what Hugo Mercierand Dan Sperber call the Enigma of Reason It’s tempting to think that disagreementshappen because while I’M being rational those who disagree with me are being irrational Urgh If only people would use reason and logic What’s happened to the world That’s a fair complaint if you’re arguingover logic puzzles but the world is not a logic puzzle this however is Paul is looking at Mary Mary is looking at Peter Paul is married Peter is unmarried Is a married person looking at an unmarriedperson Yes No Or not enough information to decide think about it The answer is YES You may have thought there’s no way to knowbecause we don’t know if Mary is married But she either is or she isn’t And if she IS then she a married personis looking at Peter an unmarried person If she ISN’T then Paul a married personis looking at her an unmarried person No matter what Mary’s deal is the answerwill be YES When people get this puzzle wrong and thecorrect answer is explained to them they almost always immedaitely see why it’s rightand change their mind Life is not usually like that Now take a look at this logical syllogism All elephants are awesome Michael is an elephant Therefore Michael is awesome This conclusion is logically valid But it’s not SOUND The conclusion follows from these assumptionsbut are these assumptions true No I am NOT an elephant Also this premise … is subjective What does it MEAN to be awesome Can you measure it with an awesomeometer So you can see why when analyzing somethinglike our impact on the planet logic can only be a partial tool If some people have more to lose than otherswho gets to decide which are fair Still though it would seem that reasoningshould be able help out here If each of us would just attend to ONLY thefacts surely we’d all recognize the same reasonable approach Problem is that’s not how reasoning works Since the scientific study of human reasoningbegan about a hundred years ago it’s been found again and again that we’re not onlyBAD at reasoning lazy and biased but almost seem PROGRAMMED to be bad Like the flaws are intentional… In an episode of Mind Field I once used amagician to pull off a little experiment He asked people to look at two faces and choosewhich of the two they would prefer to work with placing their preferences in one pileand those they rejected into another Then the pile of people they picked wereshown again and each person was asked to provide a REASON for why they chose that person But with a little slight of hand the magicianmanaged to sneak in some of the faces they had just rejected Amazingly the majority of people didn’teven notice the trick Not only that they were able to effortlesslyexplain the reasons behind their choice — a choice they never actually made Remembering faces you’ve only seen brieflyisn’t the easiest thing to do but other studies have shown that even if the task involvesanswering questions about one’s political beliefs — things we would seemingly havea firmer grasp on — still nearly half of participants will fail to notice that answersthey gave have been reversed when they’re later asked to explain them Point is we seem practically BUILT to givereasons for whatever we think we must and NOT the reasons we actually used to reacha conclusion What if we don’t even USE reasons to formour beliefs Let’s talk about INTUITIONS Our brains have evolved over millions of yearsto react to the world around us in brilliant ways with little to no input from us For example when you notice that someoneis upset you’ve don’t consciously think “ok so their eyebrows and oriented likethat their speaking is curt their posture … hmmmm … ah ha those are reasons toconclude that they are upset” Instead the belief that they may be upsetwas just apparent You intuited it You ‘know’ it without exactly know HOWyou exactly you came to know it The mood recognizing parts of your brain operatein a way that is opaque to your awareness BUT if someone asks you why you think they’reupset you can nonetheless produce all sorts of reasons — some may have been the onesyour brain actually attended to But they’re all just guesses Instead of using reasoning to COME to conclusionswe use conclusions to come to reasons To be fair we CAN go the other way We love puzzles and when we don’t have astrong intuition either way we can sit down and mull over various reason to think onething or another Our love of puzzles suggests that reasoninghas a survival value Organisms that found it pleasurable wouldbe more likely to use it But when we reason alone even when we haveno motivation to reach any particular conclusion we STILL exhibit deep biases that seem lesslike mistakes and more like features For example it’s been shown that betweentwo otherwise similar products people will prefer to buy the one with more features — evenif they don’t want those features never plan to use them and think they’re allpointless and over complicated Why Well it might be that we find such decisionseasier to justify … to OTHERS We won’t feel embarrassed if someone criticizesus for getting fewer features After decades of findings like this HugoMercier and Dan Sperber began to hypothesize that reasoning to help us make better decisionsbut instead to help us make social decisions Humans inhabit a cognitive niche on this planet We aren’t strong or sharp or hidden or venomousinstead our advantage comes from cognition reasoning and cooperation We can plan hunt build traps and engagein coordinated strategies that can be tested and modified on the fly not by millenniaof evolution Reasons allow us to so those things It’s hard to convince people that your intuitionsare true But if you can give REASONS for them itsa whole heck of a lot easier to convince other people that you’re right Reason also allows us to justify ourselvesin the eyes of others To explain who we are and express the kindsof reasons we like what other people can expect from us and what we will likely expectfrom them This social theory of reasoning helps explainwhy two people can earnestly and rationally arrive at different views They each have their own unique brain andvalues and dispositions and experiences and THAT’S what drove their thinking The reasons they give may or may not be theREAL reasons they came to their conclusions but it’s the best anyone can do The social theory also explains why peopletend to give such weak reasons for their beliefs at first or when their intended audience doesn’tneed much convincing It would be a waste of time and cognitivereasources to construct grand slam reasons for everything I said and did and thoughtwhen it wasn’t necessary Instead I can offload some of the work toother people If I say “I want to have lunch at ABC Burgers”my friend might say “ah no thanks I had burgers yesterday” and I might reply back“oh well that’s no problem they also have hot dogs and great salads” But if my friend said “ah no thanks I’mtrying to spend less money eating out this month” I might reply “oh well ABC Burgersis really cheap and Ive got a coupon” What’s going on there is that I’m providingreasons only as my interlocutor presses for them If they press harder and harder my reasonswill become better and better until either I win them over or we come to some differentmore harmonious decision So when people appear to be lazy reasonersor to have bad reasons or none at all it’s usually just the case that they’re usingreason as it evolved to function socially It starts off weak improving if others pushit and always tailoring its work to an intended audience the social theory of reasons can even explainthe existence of biases that otherwise make little sense For example it would seem that in comingto conclusions about the world it would behoove an organism to pay particular attention toinformation that went against what it believed That way they would be able to adjust theirbeliefs making them truer more general and more complete To a certain extent that IS what happens… but not always When someone “does their own research”they often come to the very conclusion they wanted after all When a person strongly believes that our impacton the planet isn’t a problem they tend to gravitate towards reasons it might notbe and see such reasons in all kinds of data This is called the CONFIRMATION BIAS ourtendency to look for prefer and interpret information so that it confirms what we alreadythink It frustrates our ability to accept new inconvienentdata and is a problem for the intellectualist view of reason If reason is for finding truth and makingbetter decisions why would it have this major weakness Because the social theory says reasoningis a GROUP ACTIVITY If I think that option A is true and the bestand you think option B is true and the best if we both researched BOTH options and siftedthrough reasons in support of BOTH options we would both have twice the work to do thanwe would if instead I simply came up with reason for why I was right and you attendedto reasons for why YOU were right The confirmation bias at least HALVES thecognitive work that must be done Now sometimes a lone reasoner will have abad idea Or a decent idea with some bad parts The reasons they have to justify and arguefor it will be suffiencent for them and those who intuitively agree but may be weak But subjected to deliberation put forth intothe machine of collective thought it can be evaulated and judged not by one mind ora group of minds thinking alike but by something special … the crowd Humans have long known of the WISDOM OF THECROWDS the phenomenon by which a collection of many people can process information intoa conclusion better than any one person could do alone It’s why we don’t trust big decisionsto a single person no matter how educated or powerful they are Instead we ask a group of to deliberate To reason together In this way the biases and errors of eachis smoothed out and the decision wiser In a famous example it’s been repeatedlyshown that if you ask a bunch of people to guess how many jelly beans are in a jar you’llfind that the average of all of their answers is CLOSER TO THE REAL NUMBER than any oneindividual was alone Even the smartest individual What happens is that although some peoplemay guess a number way too big that mistake is balanced out by the fact that others willinevitably guess a number way too small All together their disagreement evens outinto spectacular accuracy We have now arrived at the problem Reasoning evolved to be used socially wheremany different perspectives had to all deliberate towards a common conclusion Such contexts are becoming less and less common And it is becoming easier and easier to simplybe a lone reasoner justifying only a particular viewpoint without doing the harder work ofdeliberating and acting The internet gives voices to more perspectivesthan ever before in our history but it also makes it easy to disengage from accountabilityand find places where everyone believes what you do Furthermore because of technology we confrontmore issues more rapidly than ever before that we’re expected to have opinions about And the growing complexity and specializationof the modern world makes it difficult for each of us to have wellinformed preparedreasons for the acceleraeting accretion of intutions we must form in response we look for lone reasoners whocan defend our intuitions for us They reasons they give don’t need to begood just good ENOUGH that we can feel like justification exists In the past unconvincing reasons had to bepainted on sandwich boards But now the democritization of communicationmeans that even unpopular unconvincing nonsensical ideas can be presented with the same trustinducingtypefaces and professional look as common ones Those who disagree may challenge the reasonsyou’ve been given show them to be contradictory and produce betters ones for THEIR side butto what end It’s all preparation for a debate that nevercomes You play a very small role in deciding howsociety is run Even if a good faith discussion between arepresentative slice of America came to a resolution if nothing can come of it whynot just throw shade and sick burns or revel in the pleasure of reasoning by treating everythinglike a big giant puzzle Its easy to think that it doesn’t matterbecause after all those in charge the brilliant scientists and powerful billionaires willsurely come to our rescue Some giant TECHNOSALVATION is surely on thehorizon Perhaps it is But everything we know about reason suggetsthat those implementing it should be held accountable by as many different perspectivesas possible Leaders could lead deliberations and be electedfor their ability to moderate social reasoning but that’s boring Why lead when you could follow look at whatsome people believe and generate reasons for why they’re right and they’ll love it Of course the hard work — the REAL work— the work that truly elevates us on this planet is not in telling poeple that they’reright but in trying to convince others and in so doing use reason as it evolved to beused The future of reason may in fact be the pastof reason In practice what does all this look like Some researchers have gone so far as to recommendnational deliberation days where citizens celebrate by literally joining small groupsand talking through their opinions and comparing reasons Tests of such strategies have shown that areturn to the small targeted discussions our reasoning abilities evolved to excel inleaves all participants with a greater understanding of not just what they believe and why butabout decisions that could actually be made and actions that could be taken Others have gone even further recommendingthat the true future of reason at its best is the construction of a lottocracy A form of government where decisions are madenot by elected leaders but by people literally chosen at random We decide the fate of a person this way whynot the fate of the people What IF decisions were made not by politiciansalone but at least occasionally by groups of actual citizens representing differencesin thought not just geography who were brought together and paid for their time to learnfrom experts and then deliberate on an assigned issue until a conclusion was reached or atthe least a recommendation Instead of being motivated by reelectionmoney attention and power individuals chosen at random would have only their consciousto guide them Special interests and corporations wouldn’tbe able to cozy up to those likely to be elected — if any one of us could some day servethey’d have cozy up to and protect … all of us Instead of the learning and deliberation beingdone by people you never meet with offices in buildings you can’t access graduallyover time more and more of your very own neighbors would have had the honor People chosen at random would obviously lackthe same celebrity status and mandate that elected leaders cultivate and achieve — andiconic figures we relate to aren’t bad — but our understanding of reasoning is making itmore and more clear that we evolved not to be leave thinking up to a few great mindsbut to the authorty of THE great mind The lumbering organ of thought that is everyoneand everything This is in fact how democracy first workedlotteries were used to fill many political positions in Anceint Athens Aristotle explained that “the appointment of magistrates by lot isthought to be democratic and the election of them is oligrchic” where an oligrachy is government by only asmall number of people Regardless of HOW reason is brought back toits social roots if we can build more and better areanas for deliberation and use themto apply reason properly to hyperobjects like the impact of emissions on the planet we’llhave taught one heck of a lesson to people a hundred a thousand years into the future I like to think that although widening participationwill be difficult it might provide us all with a kind of existential security The impact of emission on our planet is notgoing to be the last hyperproblem we face If we can do a good job with it maybe farin the future when our civilization has advanced to the point at which people can be quantumlyrerecreated or something they’ll look back at our time and say hey let’s bringthem all back to life We could use the cooperative abilities theyhad then Ultimately the old saying that “historyis the great teacher” isn’t a bad guide We will all some day be teachers ourselvesbecause some day we will all be history too we will some day be the ancients And we can choose what that will mean And as always thanks for

Illusions of Time,2021-01-08T20:38:36Z,31.133333333333333,17941968,834033,hey vsauce michael here when something becomes part of the past can it ever truly be experienced again obviously my beard will grow back but it wont be the same beard and it wont be on the same person it will be on a slightly older different michael but of course the bearded michael of the past isnt completely gone no he still exists in our minds as a memory and in the form of records of the past like images and video hi im the slightly older different michael you heard about i am 130 days older than that guy wow 130 days you know it really doesnt seem like it was that long ago just as an optical illusion is a distortion of our sense of sight a temporal illusion is a distortion of our sense of time some seem small like how a minute spent waiting in line can seem to take forever but an entire day with friends can just fly by some seem deeper like the uncanny feeling we get from recordings that make people from long ago seem more real than usual or the strange way time seems to sneak by for example the songs i liked as a kid wannabe mbop semicharmed life are as old to kids born today as the literal oldies were when i was born how could that be true am i really that old now i mean i shouldnt be surprised i know how time works but yet i dont far from being just mistakes these illusions are the edges of another dimension of spacetime not one given to us by physics not one given at all but one made by our minds lets begin with the different ways there are to feel time actually sitting down and consciously tuning into the passage of time as it happens is called feeling time prospectively you cant do that to time thats already happened except you can if i were to ask you without looking to guess how long you have been watching this video youd probably be able to come up with a guess you were reasonably confident in well you arrived at that guess by feeling time retrospectively by measuring it as it appears in your memory now with that in mind we are ready to approach our first illusion the holiday paradox a four hour delay at the airport before your holiday can feel unbearably long while its happening but once you arrive an exciting day at your destination can seem to fly by those feelings are all prospective timing a week later retrospectively the delay often feels like a blip in your mind and the day of sightseeing feels like a much longer bigger part of your life these are the long short and short long patterns of felt time which one you feel depends on whether what you are doing is empty or full an empty activity is monotonous unstimulating unimportant to you whereas a full activity is packed with sensations novelty significance context change and challenge now i experienced this during my three days in isolation while i was there time dragged very very slowly a fear i have right now is that its just friday and theres still a lot of time left but now years later its hard to believe that i spent three full days in that room jeez seems like something i barely did well its believed that perspective time feels fast when an activity is full because youre not busy thinking about time if youre not attending to it youre busy with something else well you wont notice how much time has passed but to understand retrospective illusions lets ask a different question does time speed up as we get older many of you may feel the same way looking back my childhood feels like it lasted so long but my 20s went by faster and my 30s are going by even faster than that a popular explanation is the proportion theory it suggests that time seems to speed up as we age because each new unit of time that we live is smaller relative to all the time that came before the year you lived as a nineyearold was 10 of your entire existence up to that point but when youre 30 another year is just 3 percent more life studies have found little evidence that weeks months or even years are retrospectively remembered as passing faster by those who are older but decades yes and while its true that the older we get the faster we tend to think the last 10 years went by that only appears to be the case until about the age of 50 after that the speed of decades appears to plateau a leading explanation is that how long a duration feels depends on how many things in it can be recalled in my normal life lots of different things happen every three days but during the three days i was in isolation so little happened that i have few distinct memories from it my mind sees that emptiness and perceives that it was brief so perhaps a decline in new experiences and rapid novelty as we age means fewer events our brains decide to commit to memory so then looking back because there are fewer distinct memories from more recent decades we assume they were shorter you know reflecting on all of this its striking just how many moments are forgettable john koenig the author of the dictionary of obscure sorrows calls the awareness of how few days are memorable olika over time our specific daily perceptions of what happened conglomerate into generalized ideas about how things were themes moods the big picture what was perceptual becomes conceptual and concepts are good they lower cognitive load by wringing out details leaving us with the broader lighter just but they can also obscure reality which brings us to our second distortion chronological illusions the world of our experience is not made of distinct entities its a continuity of fuzzy overlapping blobs and we impose concepts on it for example is a hot dog a sandwich is cereal soup how many holes does a straw have those arent questions about reality there are questions about words we made up periodization is the chopping up of time into contrived pieces like the stone age the renaissance the 80s the 90s but heres the thing when did the 80s or 90s really happen i mean mathematically they refer to years that have eights or nines in the tens place but conceptually well its not like on january 1st 1980 people woke up and were like whoa whoa whoa guys its the 80s quick everyone change your clothes concepts say too much and too little facts that expose their imperfections are perennial favorites on social media i made an entire video about them in fact but what hasnt been discussed yet is the mechanisms by which we allow them to do their dirty work lets dig in and see what we can find if i asked you to lay down on the floor of a windowless clockless room and get up after you thought a minute had passed youd probably do a pretty good job but if i asked you to get up after you thought 10 years had passed thatd be hard we lack an ability to sense and grasp long periods of time also we cant remember everything that happens so instead of comprehending historys correct scale and structure i believe that our minds often just use how we think about past events to place them relative to each other in time one way we do this is through what i call the conceptual comparison heuristic a technique whereby we use the similarity of elements in our conceptions of things to judge their temporal distance if our concepts of two things suggest wildly different times its natural to assume that a lot of things happened between them and if a lot happened the duration separating them must be large alternatively if our concepts arent too different the time between them must be bearer of events and so it feels brief its not a bad strategy but tyrannosaurus died out 66 million years ago and when trexes began roaming the earth stegosaurus had already been extinct for more than 80 million years to a trex the stegosaurus was even more ancient than we think trexes are heres another example when we think of marilyn monroe we think of a young woman old hollywood midcentury glamour americana black and white when we think of the queen of england we think of an old woman in color in england and news headlines because those conceptions are quite different we mentally place each woman in a different time so it can come as a surprise to learn that they were both born in the same year similarly it can be surprising to learn that anne frank and martin luther king jr were also born in the same year and if they were alive today they would both be younger than the queen of england when harriet tubman was born thomas jefferson was alive and when she died ronald reagan was alive this is surprising to many of us because our concepts of these people are anchored to them as adults but harriet tubman was a fouryearold when thomas jefferson died and when she died ronald reagan was a twoyearold far from just being amusing chronological illusions can often have teeth america can feel like an idea fixed long before any of us by the overwhelming bulk of events that came before but barbara walters has been alive for more than a third of americas entire history and if you were 25 you have already lived through and been a part of more than 10 of americas history chronological illusions may also be caused by what i call the construal level heuristic a technique whereby we place things in time based on whether we construe them concretely or abstractly in social psychology construal level theory describes how abstract and concrete thinking relate to psychological distance that is how distant something seems as opposed to how distant it actually is now unsurprisingly its been found that people tend to think about things that are psychologically distant more abstractly but studies have also found that if people are asked to think about an event abstractly theyll consider it more distant than if asked to construe it concretely this may explain why things can turn out to be longer ago or more recent than we thought if an event recedes especially quickly from relevance or is suddenly replaced in our daily thoughts by other more urgent events unconnected to it our minds may shift its construal to a higher level making it feel further back in time than it really is conversely if attending to the low level details of an event continues to be important our construal level heuristic will make it feel closer in time than it really is our third illusion of time comes from the fact that time is always moving forward because of that the psychological distances we feel towards things should also always be changing but not all of them do the belief that your place in time is stable is what i call the chronostatic illusion tim urban pointed out that it is now the case that jurassic park forest gump the lion king were all released closer to the moon landing than today as a person who remembers the lion king being brand new and remembers feeling at that time that the moon landing was old this is all very weird the lion king seems so much more recent than the moon landing ever did to me the conceptual comparison heuristic places them far apart my concept of the 90s will probably always stray from my concept of the present a little less than it should because the 90s and now have something in common that the 90s and the 60s never did or will me also my construal level of the lion king may resist becoming abstract because the lion king continues to evolve and happen the mechanisms i use to place things in time have sunk hooks into the lion king creating a sort of chronostatic cling that fools me into believing its more near the music that was new when i was young has also been tethered in my mind to the idea of new stuff only us kids get even as it has actually been drifting away as far away as the stuff i used to think was far a chronostatic illusion is spectacularly broken when you realize that you have become as old as your parents were when you were born it doesnt always seem quite right they came first and as such should always be older but suddenly youre aware of a way in which they arent your age gap with people in the past is not static your parents keep getting older right along with you but the people they were dont this can lead to empathetic realizations they werent any wiser or more folded into the world then than you are now considering the temporal perspectives of other people leads us to a fourth distortion the chronocentric illusion the belief that our own relationship to time is the best or only frame of reference or that its more important and more real than any other my grandparents used to tell me about how when they were kids they didnt have television and i always thought that sounded so weird i mean obviously i knew it was true but like what the heck did they do with their free time it wasnt relatable at all people back then must have been so different not real in the same way i was but i remember a time before the internet before mobile phones and it wasnt that weird the internet and cell phones are still in my mind an additional thing we now have but for my daughter they will be what weve always had and when i tell her about a time when no one had the internet and didnt even know they needed it it will likely sound to her just like the old stories i heard about growing up with no tv and thats bizarre my grandparents childhood was weird it was the olden days mine was totally normal protagonist syndrome is the belief that you are the main character of the universe recognizing that you arent is what john koenig famously called saunder the realization that other people like that stranger over there you will never see again have full lives just as important and consuming to them as yours is to you id like to add to protagonist syndrome the concept of above syndrome abovo means from the egg from the very beginning in literature it describes a story that begins at the start ab ovo as opposed to in the middle in medius res ab ovo syndrome is the belief that the movie of the universe began when you began that the times of your life are the plot and contain the climax and that everything before you was just backstory everything after merely sequels when you realize that thats not true that you were not born ab ovo but in medius res that youll die before the credits and that everyone who has ever lived was a fully fleshed out protagonist in their own minds that feeling is what i call chrono saunder saunder not just for people over there but for people over then overcoming the chronocentric illusion isnt always easy it doesnt help that people from the past are finished unlike us who still have choices to make they tell the same story over and over again theyre also separated by barriers made of their own evidence the world wasnt actually black and white in the past and it didnt suddenly become vertical in the present obviously we all know that but the arbitrary technical properties of a times recording media can influence our perception of the past nonetheless if silent films didnt look so much different from what could be done just a few decades later would it be nearly as surprising to learn that charlie chaplin lived long enough to watch star wars when i was in high school i saw 2001s pipe dream for the first time and it blew my mind my friends and i honestly believed that it was a real thing someone had built but recently i looked it up on youtube and i was like this is clearly a computer animation what the heck was wrong with us and what do you know the top comment was exactly that sentiment our perception of the past is constantly evolving as technology does and thats significant we dont just think about the past we also think about the past the material properties of an artifact can influence our relationship with what came before and push it further away faded yellowy color sepia sd pixelated video technological features can make the past seem like it was never as real as the present but some kinds of evidence collapsed that chronocentric divide one way they can do it right now is by being demotic ordinary personal candid such recordings are much more similar to the media we exchange with each other right now in the present this footage of people goofing around in a 7eleven in 1987 has more than 6 million views not just because of nostalgia but because its like visiting past people in their natural habitat at a time zoo this isnt some pageant with timeless ambitions its a view out the window of a time machine they dont know is there another way evidence can corrode chronocentric illusions is by containing a convention more normal than we expect people in old photos look like serious robots because back then you had to stay in the same pose for a long time to get a picture taken but also a longstanding trope in the world of images up to that point was that smiling or looking goofy wasnt a sign of happiness but of drunkenness or stupidity but every so often this image pops up online and people vehemently debate whether its actually old or not sure its black and white but the expression seems too normal to really be on a person from the past it is however actually an honest to gosh picture taken in the early 1900s one of the earliest known photographs of a human smiling in fact the juxtaposition of an expression someone today might make with a medium that suggests a technology of the past creates an opportunity for chronosaunder the subject is both dead and undead gone but not as unrelatably far as we may have thought the past was finally the chronocentric divide can fade when we find the past captured in a medium that was rare at the time but more common now this is footage taken by an early hd camera of new york city in 1993 its pretty cool but theres something almost uncanny about it watching it isnt exactly like time traveling back to 1993 but it looks more like video taken today than many of us expect its like peering through a telescope we can see them but they cant see us they appear closer more actual than usual we lean in to get grasps of what it was like thats part of the allure of time travel as lp hartley said the past is a foreign country they do things differently there but it hasnt always been that way time travel wasnt a common feature of fiction until the 19th century not because people hadnt thought of it before they had but the past and future werent rich with interesting destinations in the same way they are to us now in the year 1008 it wasnt an insult to call someone 1000 and late one thousand years ago the culture and technology around you was unlikely to be foreign to your parents or grandparents or greatgrandparents and outside of an act of god or gods you didnt expect them to be foreign to your children or their children either one thousand years ago there were no 80s parties because the 980s werent interestingly different premodern societies viewed the present as a continuation of the past changes were interpreted as temporary disturbances of the natural state but today we see the present as something special change is significant enough and rapid enough now that we would imagine ourselves quite differently had we been born 10 years earlier or later zachary sarah schiffman points out we failed to realize that people before the 18th century did not see themselves this way instead of having a history they regarded themselves as having an unchanging nature or essence whose full realization might be impeded or impelled but not otherwise shaped by events nostalgia existed but for moments and places gone simply because they were prior to or away from here and now not because they were fundamentally different and categorically irretrievable as the discovery of antiquities and new worlds and new species accelerated as the invention of new technologies and new ways of recording accelerated the present became less and less like the past reinhardt caselk has argued that between 1750 and 1850 the acceleration of history reached a speed at which static or cyclical views of time had to be replaced with our modern view which understands the past to be essentially different from the present it used to be that things passed now there is a past as technological and social change accelerate the window of time within which things can be trusted to remain stable shrinks in such a world to stand still is scary hartman rosa observed the premodern experience of being excluded is replaced in modernity by the constantly present fearinducing possibility of becoming excluded in the sense of getting left behind things change faster and faster and we keep keeping up because we are afraid to die whoever lives twice as fast can realize twice as many worldly possibilities and thus as it were live two lives in the span of one whoever becomes infinitely fast no longer needs to fear death the annihilator of options acceleration becomes a secular substitute for eternity to achieve this salvation we try to make things faster and easier to save time but one of the greatest hoodwinks we ever pulled on ourselves was not noticing that the things we do to save time leave us with less of it and more alone in it no technological change is only technological the car allowed people to travel more quickly and whenever they wanted but once available it meant people could live further from where they worked so cities and towns changed personal associations changed roads divided neighborhoods created new opportunities while ending others jobs and industries and cultural forms of expression and a whole different society sprang into existence simply because we found a way to move faster likewise smartphones and the internet made information access and communication easier and faster but thats not all they did along with them came new social conventions new communities new levels of exposure to ideas and conflict a new understanding of what it meant to be available thats a lot to have to adapt to they even redefined what now is made of digital spaces are filled with not just whats being said but also what has been said and its all right there not tucked into a library across town or on a tiny plaque on a statue covered in bird poop its in our hands and outside of time things used to acquire signs of age veneers that tucked them appropriately into their place in time now theyre automatically updated to always look like now digital spaces are so packed with timeless messages between bygone people that we dont even ask is anyone here anymore instead we ask is anyone now in order to adapt to all of this we have to consume information in an increasingly dehumanized decontextualized and decentralized way each next bit is often unrelated to the last our participation is not acknowledged or assumed and its all fed to us by machines we dont know and didnt build that only put it in our eyes and ears the sheer weight of all of this accreting information and its growing accessibility is aweinspiring it may even be our purpose i mean what else produces such detailed records purposefully or not we record save collect organize and preserve events like nothing else in the universe ive said before that if humans were to go extinct the sun would still shine the universe would keep expanding jupiter would continue being gassy but the universe would lose its best autobiographer but the technologies of this project have yet to address our bodies enter the tv paradox remember the short long and long short patterns of time well a new pattern has been emerging and growing in frequency short short it was first observed in people watching tv alone they reported feeling like time flew by quickly oh wow have i really been watching for four hours but later they didnt remember their tv session as a major moment of significant import or duration they didnt attend the passing of time during it they didnt feel bored or like time dragged but they also didnt accumulate a lot of new significant memoryworthy experiences rapid stimulating streams of experience provide a fullness that makes time fly by but fractured decentralized oneway experiences feel unconnected to ourselves and our larger life histories retrospectively they dont fill up a lot of space they burn our time on both ends it feels shorter during and after interestingly short short has not been found when people engage with content they have connections with for example things they own memorabilia of made friendships through attended conventions about so the pace of life may be taking your life from you but standing could give you your life back in the future we will surely find other ways to overcome the negative side effects of the faster experiences we crave the development of digital media that engage the other senses more linked as they are with longterm memory or that build contexts for us could help so could surgical solutions like removing the parts of the brain that make us not like doom scrolling probably first any anxieties will be recognized as a condition treatable with medication now this is all to say that we live in a transitional period the conquest of space made the world smaller and now the conquest of time has made our

The Odd Number Rule,2020-07-29T20:26:40Z,22.116666666666667,10261875,488781,hey vsauce michael here why though why are any of us here whats the purpose what does it all mean well sometimes if we listen closely enough when we ask why we can hear an answer and its another question why why what our journey begins here checking the rulebook but you wont find anything in there it says a dog cant play hes right aint no rule said the dog cant play basketball is that true is there really no rule against a dog playing middle school basketball vsauce magic 8 ball is there really no rule against a dog playing basketball the answer is yes or is it we have begun the actor who played airbud buddy the dog passed away in 1998 at the age of nine now take a look at this lets talk about world war one on june 28 1914 franz ferdinand the heir to the throne of austriahungary and his wife sophie were assassinated in sarajevo while riding in a car the cars license plate was a iii iii118 they were killed by gavrilo princip who said during his trial that he wanted the unification of all hugo slavs free from austria the event sparked a series of escalations in europe the july crisis which ultimately caused world war one a war that ended on armistice day november 11 1918 pretty odd huh a spooky coincidence if you will but look odd things happen all the time oddness is all around us especially in the form of odd numbers the grip they have on our reality is revealed when we release our grip notice anything strange under the influence of gravity things move in an odd way if something starts moving because of gravity after say one second it will have traveled some distance now interestingly during the next second the distance it will travel will be three times as far as it moved during the first second during the third second it will travel five times as far then seven times then nine times eleven thirteen fifteen we used seconds but it doesnt matter what time interval you use you will always find this pattern the odd number rule hiding right there within the very phenomenon that keeps us on earth are the odd numbers more like god numbers right is the odd number rule the face of the universe looking back at us well here is something that galileo wrote philosophy is written in this grand book i mean the universe which stands continuously open to our gaze but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language in which it is written it is written in the language of mathematics and its characters are triangles circles and other geometric figures without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it without these one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth before this pattern in the grand book of the universe was read and appreciated people wondered why things fell maybe stuff just has a desire to be in its own proper place right rocks with the earth fire with the air that makes sense right it was fun to imagine causes and write our own stories but underneath our desire for explanations a story was already being told one that is written in the language of mathematics measure and relation now many of these stories are being told all around us all the time one on top of each other but if we can look past those disturbances each isolated event is narrating a quiet simple story not of why the universe is but of what the universe is galileo recognized what this pattern spelled mathematically it spells hello i am speeding up at a constant rate and that was huge all this time for millennia we had been wondering about the causes of gravity its cosmic purpose why it existed but now here was someone saying yeah yeah cool but like what does it do it makes things fall great well what does that mean what does it mean to fall fall how now the human mind alone couldnt answer that but the universe was telling us we just had to speak its language and read it this is i am gaining velocity at a constant rate spelled with odd numbers how well whats an odd number the concept of oddness comes from the observation that sometimes when you have a bunch of things everything you have can be paired up but sometimes that cant happen now when its possible when you can pair everything up that you have it is said that the number of things you have is even if you cant do that then the number of things you have is odd now what this means is that the number of objects in an even group is equal to 2 times n where n is just the number of whole pairs that you have so n is any whole number n could be for example 50 giving us the even number of 100 which is also the number of legs centipedes have or is it centa 100 peed feet having 100 legs is right there in the name but its only approximate centipedes have been observed to have anywhere from 30 to 345 legs now 100 falls pretty nicely in that range but every pair of legs on a centipede is attached to a body segment which means that in order to have 100 legs a centipede would need to have 50 body segments but not a single species of centipede has an even number of body segments 50 segments is nowhere to be found in the library of centipede genomes so while centipedes on average have a number of legs quite close to 100 they never naturally have exactly 100 point is 2n is the mathematical way to spell even if i add just one more thing the amount i have is no longer even its odd if i add yet another thing ive added another pair and has gone up by one and the number is even again this means that an even number plus just one more will always be odd now that we know how to mathematically spell odd and even we can move on to moving if you and me hugged well that would be wonderful we would both get so much out of it but if during the hug you suddenly ran away from me while yelling im leaving you at a velocity of two meters per second well i would be devastated but i would know that deep down you still cared for me because you told me your velocity and if i know your velocity i can know just how far away you are from me at all times all i have to do is take your velocity and multiply it by the number of seconds that have elapsed since you left now take a look at what a graph of your velocity would look like here we have velocity in meters away from me per second and we have time in seconds since the hug ended now if your velocity is two meters per second and that persists then heres a graph of your velocity but look at this after a number of seconds have elapsed like after one second the distance you are away is just the rate times the time elapsed two times one well that also happens to be the area of the rectangle bounded by a line coming up from the time your velocity graph and our axes well thats pretty convenient after two seconds you are two times two four meters away from me which is also the area of this shape weve created after three seconds you are three times two one two three four five six meters away its always the area well thats pretty convenient but lets change up the story what if we hugged and it was great i mean just almost not even a hug like something new is being invented here but then during that you suddenly leave you run away from me and while you run you yell i am leaving you at an everchanging velocity well i would say you know what that is a lot less helpful now lets say that this changing velocity you have that i dont know happens to be an acceleration of two meters per second per second what does that mean well that means that your velocity is getting bigger by two meters per second for every second that you run it would look like this on a graph you begin hugging me with no velocity and then one second later your velocity is two meters per second larger so two larger than zero is two thats your velocity after one second after two seconds your velocity is two larger still so four and then six your velocity graph would look something like this but now heres a question if youre moving like this is the distance you are away from me at any given time still just the area of the shape bounded its harder to see that because you dont maintain any single velocity for any amount of time your velocity is always changing so we dont have nice rectangles but we can see that it is true by putting ourselves in my shoes abandoned alone i dont even know your emotion i dont even know how youre accelerating its very scary but i can decide to take matters into my own hands and measure your velocity as often as i like lets say that i measure it just once i measure it after lets say two seconds all right wonderful now the question i want to answer is how far away you are after three seconds all right so i have this measurement i know that you were traveling at four meters per second well i mean look if youre going four meters per second for one second then thats a rectangle like this and its got an area of four um but youre not four meters away are you youre a lot further than that because you werent traveling four meters per second for this entire second you were at all times actually traveling a bit faster and im totally forgetting all the distance you covered before my measurement which is not zero okay so clearly i need to measure your velocity more frequently so lets say that i measure your velocity twice during the three seconds im curious about lets say i measure it after one second and then after two seconds well now i can imagine rectangles here this one is two by one so it has an area of two this one is four by one so it has an area of four two plus four is six but youre a lot more than six meters away as well because you werent traveling two meters per second this entire time you were actually speeding up covering more and more distance im totally forgetting all the distance you covered over here basically this method will always leave me short but the more frequently i check your velocity the better things get take a look at this oh yeah oh wow as you can see the more frequently i check your velocity the closer my calculation gets to being based off of what you really did your actual motion but also the more frequently i check your velocity the closer the combined area of all of my rectangles gets to simply being equal to the actual area bounded by your velocity curve which means that the area under your velocity curve even when your curve is like this is still totally the distance you are away from me now lets take this knowledge and apply it to the odd number rule before people knew how things fell there were some pretty good guesses for example if the reason things fall is that they have within them a desire to be in their own proper place uh in this example the table well then maybe the closer this object gets to the table the more excited it is to be there and the faster it goes in which case its velocity would change over time like this getting steeper and steeper and steeper but galileo didnt think that he believed that when objects fell their velocities increased at a constant rate so graphed like this their velocity would just follow a straight line lets draw a straight line beautiful now lets divide this graph up into strips of equal time perfect all right now as we know the areas of the shapes we have bounded here are the distances traveled during their respective time intervals so whats the area of our first shape here a little triangle well we dont know what it is we dont have any um actual markings here on our axes but thats fine it doesnt really matter well just call this one so in the first second or the first time interval our object traveled a distance of one unit of space perfect now how far did our object travel during the second time interval well that distance will be equal to that area well what is this area well one thing we can do to make this easier is to divide the shape like this now we have two shapes a triangle and a rectangle this triangle has the exact same area as our initial triangle thats because they are congruent triangles they both have the same base length and because this velocity line has a constant slope it rises the same amount per time elapsed all the time so their heights are the same and theyre both right triangles their areas are the same so the area of this space is the area of that triangle plus the area of this rectangle what is the area of this rectangle well one thing we can do is divide the rectangle in half with a diagonal like this and look what weve created this triangle has the exact same area as our initial triangle it has the same height it has the same base theyre both right angles and look the same goes for this one its a right triangle its base is the same as this space its height is the same as this ones height gosh this is just the area of the initial triangle but twice so we have two of them and we have two of them one time okay perfect now lets move on to finding the area of that shape once again i can divide this shape like that and now i have a triangle which as we know has the same area as our initial triangle right here so we have that area one and then we also have look at that two rectangles which as we know we can divide in half like this giving us now four triangles equal in area to the initial one so what weve done is weve taken the initial area and we have doubled it uh well once and then twice so two times now as we continue doing this we find that were always adding one more of our original areas and then were always doubling that original area one more time here weve doubled it one two three times doubled three times well look at this pattern right here we can think of one as being equal to two times zero plus one cant we well these numbers are whole numbers and theyre just going up by one zero one two three this is all of the general form two n plus 1 that is how you mathematically spell odd so the odd number rule is not some kind of magical coincidence its just what happens when an objects velocity increases at a constant rate the answer was right there in front of us all along written in the mathematical language of the universe the universe also contains colorado one of its best rectangles or is it lets find out after a quick word from our sponsor us hi im michael stevens are you a person well then get out of here go poop or something i only

like a rectangle a shape with four sides that all meet at the same angle but colorado doesnt have four sides it has 697 making it not a rectangle but instead a hexa hecta india contact heptagon and this was all by mistake the united states congress initially defined colorado as a geospherical rectangle the space bounded by two lines of latitude and two lines of longitude in the 19th century surveyors set out to demarcate its shape to actually mark it on the ground and they did a phenomenal job with the tools that they had but mistakes were made some were large enough that you can spot them on many common maps of the state in 1925 the us supreme court ruled that the borders as surveyed were the correct ones and would legally stand as the official recognized edges of the state not the originally intended theoretically pure geospherical rectangle thus ending the shaping of colorado that began with lines drawn by the compromise of 1850 18 we have arrived article 18 section 5 paragraph 0 of the washington interscholastic activities association 199697 constitution the set of rules airbud would have been subject to at the time and place of the movie states that in order to participate in an interscholastic athletic activity like basketball a student must be a quote regular member of the school defined as someone enrolled half time or more the section does refer to rcw 28a 225010 a list of approved exceptions but not one of these was considered in the case of airbud had they been it would have been discovered quite quickly that airbud the dog qualified under absolutely none of them there is no rule that specifically states a dog cannot play basketball but there are and were rules that said that this dog airbud should not have been allowed to play

How Many Holes Does a Human Have?,2020-02-17T15:02:34Z,21.45,14319266,658619,Music hey Vsauce Michael here come on in if you keep going you will eventually emerge out my other end and for this reason it has been said that the human body is like a doughnut yeah you are just a bunch of meat packed around a central Hulk or are you humans have more than one hole right I mean weve got nostrils and ears the whole sweetpea out of the holes were born from nipples our pores yes there are subatomic gaps between the molecules were made out of where dont we have holes well that is the rub literally if you cut a clove of garlic in half and then rub that fresh raw end on your foot about an hour later you will start to taste garlic in your mouth thats because the molecules that give garlic its taste are small enough and have just the right properties to permeate skin cells in your foot enter your bloodstream and reach your mouth but you are even holier than that every second day and night about 60 billion neutrinos from the Sun pass through just your thumbnail so clearly at small enough scales how many holes does a human have becomes a meaningless question ultimately the human body isnt a solid thing that can even have holes its just a loose constellation of atoms and molecules but if we accept a minimum hole size the answer becomes pretty interesting and a good choice for this minimum is about twenty to sixty millionths of a meter about the width of a human hair a magic spaceship 60 microns wide could fly into your pores like they were giant holes like craters but it couldnt continue on through the vasculature at the other end or diffuse through cells or slip between molecules and that is significant it highlights the fact that not all holes are equal a 60 micron wide ship or string could be threaded into your mouth and come out somewhere else but it couldnt do that by entering a pore or hair follicle this makes the GI tract what engineers call a throughhole where as pores urethras nipples ears hair follicles birth canals and the sinuses are blind holes they can be entered but eventually dead end usually at narrow capillaries permeable only by things smaller than a single blood cell and the determination to not be stopped the eyeball can be squeezed under but youll eventually be stopped by the conjunctiva the sinuses are nice big rooms and our skulls but the only way out is the same Ostia you came in through as for the ear well the ear is a blast to go inside but if youre 60 microns wide the airtight eardrum will block further passage its a blind hole now altogether counting all of your pores and hair follicles youve got millions of blind holes all over your body but are they actually holes thats a real humdinger because you know what a hole is what what a hole really is its a word a colloquial fuzzy imprecise lexeme that refers to a host of disparate utterly unreconciled things that eludes a single precise mathematical definition in fact holes might not even exist I mean think about it if I eat a whole doughnut have I eaten the whole like is the hole inside me or could I eat a doughnut without eating its hole could I go to a store and buy Swiss cheese but leave the holes at the store clearly holes are at best ontologically parasitic their existence depends upon the existence of something else that they can inhabit or be a disturbance in of course the philosophy of holes rarely matters in your daytoday life you can call something a hole and context will do its work and people will know what youre talking about but take a look at this does this have a hole in it well yeah right obviously right here theres a hole I can put my hand in it it can store things its got a hole but now imagine that I could mold it like it was made out of clay and I molded it down into the shape of a drinking glass you could see how that could happen right well does a drinking glass have a hole in it if this does then this should  right I mean I didnt pinch the hole shut or glue anything together all right sure fine I mean I can accept that a drinking glass technically has a hole in it but now imagine that I took this glass and I molded it out and I widened its opening until I had a shape like this a bowl now does a bowl have a hole in it now were really stretching the use of the word hole I mean if someone said their ball had a hole in it I would think that it had a hole somewhere else and it was leaking but sure lets call this a hole its not a very prototypical one but I think you see where Im going with this if I didnt molded the bowl and flattened its sides all the way out until I had a plate a shape like this well does a plate have a hole in it not really so if a plate doesnt have a hole in it but this shape did and I continuously molded from here to the glass to the bowl to the plate and I never glued anything shut whered the hole go clearly blind holes are pretty unique they can be removed without closing or pinching anything shut compare that to the through hole of a doughnut there is no way to remove a Donuts through hole or add a new through hole without gluing stuff together squishing things together that used to not be together or ripping pieces apart poking a hole through and breaking it that is extremely significant but lets go back to the body before we get ahead of ourselves the mouth is an entrance to both blind and through holes a 60 micron wide traveler could enter it meander down the esophagus and keep going until they were well dumped out but turn down the trachea and they would dead end in the lungs now the area of the throat behind the mouth is called the pharynx its a pretty chill place except not really its actually quite warm it plays a role in warming and moistening and filtering the air that we breathe before it enters the lungs including the air we inhale through our nostrils now each nostril leads into a separate nasal vestibule thats the tunnel that you can explore when you pick your nose eventually those tunnels meet and sniffed air enters the nasal cavity a hollow air filled room in your face protruding from the walls of the nasal cavity are mucusy fins called the nasal Concha or turbinates that warm and moist in the air that passes around them from there the air flows via the pharynx down the trachea so your nostrils and your mouth are connected a string could go into your mouth or nose and come out your butt the nasal cavity is quite the hub I mean your ear holes would almost lead into it but the eardrum blocks the way if it didnt there would be clear passage from the outside into the middle ear and then down the eustachian tube into the nasal cavity via an opening about here the eustachian tube controls air pressure in the middle ear behind the eardrum and is normally collapsed shut but if the outside pressure is dramatically different than the air pressure in the middle ear swallowing and yawning can get it open equalizing the pressure thats what happens when you pop your ears its cool but its not a throughhole and thats what were looking for and as it turns out there are four more four more orifices that lead from the outside into this place your nasal cavity and they are the lacrimal punctum there is one near each of your eyelids theyre tiny openings about a third of a millimeter wide into which tears the fluid constantly moistening and protecting your eyeball drain once inside the lacrimal punctum ASA lacrimal ducts tear ducts into your nasal cavity which is why when youre making a lot of tear fluid and have to blow your nose thats not snot thats mainly tears the point is a 60 micron wide string could be pushed into any of your four lacrimal punctum threaded through your tear ducts into your nasal cavity into the pharynx and then pushed all the way out your butt pretty cool that gives us eight external openings that dont deadend but how many through holes is that I mean how many holes does a straw have this clearly has two holes but how many does this have is it one hole that Forks is it two that combined gosh maybe its three well what about this how many holes does this thing have or this topology can help us answer every single one of those questions here I have two essentially identical pieces of material Music now they are no longer identical or are they geometrically sure their shapes are now different but what didnt change about them well that is what topology studies topology is concerned with the properties that persist so long as something isnt ripped apart the famous joke that a topologist doesnt know the difference between a doughnut and a coffee cup is based on the fact that a coffee cup can be gently continuously molded into a doughnut by simply stretching and squashing no cutting gluing ripping or sewing required topologists call these gentle continuous transformations homeomorphisms and the cutting and ripping and gluing that they disallow are exactly the kinds of actions required to make new holes or remove old ones so since a coffee cup and a doughnut are homeomorphic they must have the same number of through holes and they do one we can now more precisely describe the difference we saw earlier between blind holes and through holes and understand why we are separately counting them now blind holes can be erased through a homeomorphism as such topologists dont even really consider them theyre just geometric disturbances topological holes on the other hand cannot be massage it away and unlike a blind hole where what qualifies and what doesnt is a matter of opinion the number of through holes a surface like your body and three dimensions has can be clearly defined if we are having a hard time counting through holes all we need to do is find something with an easy to count arrangement of through holes that it is homeomorphic with but first lets play around with some topological puzzles here is a to hold donut with an infinitely long unbreakable unmovable rod through one of its holes without cutting or separating any part of the shape can you figure out how to manipulate it such that the rod goes through both holes pause the video if you want to think about it remember this shape it looks like it might have three holes right its got a hole there a second hole there and a third hole here but if I flatten it you can see that it only has two holes it has one there and one there if the rod is threaded through the shape such that one wire is in front and I choose one of the other wires to be the middle of the doughnut for example this one then the rod passes through just one of the two holes but if I choose the wire in the front to be the middle of the donut well then the rod is seen to be passing through two holes likewise if you continuously deform our original to hold donut into the three tube thing and pick this tube to be the new middle tada the rod is now going through two holes no cutting or gluing required one more puzzle without cutting or breaking can you unlock this shapes intertwined loops well pause if you want to figure it out yourself heres a solution simply inflate the bulb of the shape until you can skate a leg of each loop around until theyre untangled and tada freedom alright lets define homeomorphism a little better we said it was a rubber sheet or clay like molding procedure with no cutting or breaking or gluing and thats a good introduction but honestly you can cut all you want during a homeomorphism so long as you glue everything back together the way it was in the end more precisely a homeomorphism is a bijective and by continuous function its a function because it is a list of ordered pairs where each point starts is paired with where it goes requiring that it be a by jek ssin means that it must be a special kind of function where there is a onetoone correspondence between points in one object and in the other no two points can map to the same location and no point can get magically turned into multiple new points basically material cannot be added or subtracted by continuous means that any cuts made must be later mended perfectly with points going back amongst the same neighboring points they had before in a homeomorphism if parts are scooched over everything else must flow with the scootch as if all the points are kind of sticky there is no smooth sliding along abrupt fissures the precise test for whether a function is by continuous is pretty cool now first I consider a point in one arrangement now where the function takes that point is its image okay now I choose some neighborhood around the image with a radius larger than zero and I consider all of the points within it if the function is continuous in this direction I should be able to find a neighborhood around the preimage the input point that only contains points that map inside the images neighborhood in this case I can but in this case weve got an original point and where it went but given a neighborhood around where it went every neighborhood around the original no matter how small will always contain some stuff that didnt make it over which means points got separated but not put back so the function is not continuous by continuity means that a function must be continuous in both directions okay now that we can homey amorphous lets start using it to count holes remember this shape it wasnt immediately obvious earlier how to count its holes but it is easy if we can use a homeomorphism to turn it into something with an easy to count number of holes which we can both of these shapes are homeomorphic they both have two holes to see why simply drag in mold and flow the opening of one of these shapes holes into the tunnel of the other and there we go since we didnt cut or glue the number of holes hasnt changed so this thing just like this thing always had two holes okay what about a straw well short informally it can often make sense depending on the context to differentiate between two openings in a straw the one you put in your drink and the one you put in your mouth but that does not mean it has two holes it only has one a straw is homeomorphic to a torus both openings are part of the same single hole but this process is a homeomorphism and thus does not create any new holes you can also see that openings arent holes by stretching one of the straws openings until it becomes the outer part of a doughnut there really was only ever just one hole but enough about straws lets get back to the body we found eight external openings orifices interconnected by tunnels but openings arent holes theyre parts of holes and we can count those holes as it turns out at a scale of 60 microns the human body has seven through holes the human body is not a doughnut it is a seven hold doughnut this shape can be molded and stretched into you first we choose a hole to be the GI tract the mouth anus tunnel now into this we roll half of the other orifices okay now weve got something that looks pretty dang human seven holes with eight external orifices that meet in a common space the nasal cavity if we squish all the matter in towards the tunnels will notice that our seven hold torus is topologically equivalent to four pairs of pants sewn together at the waists your body isnt a doughnut its a bodysuit for a spider okay now to finish lets make two of the legs the nostrils and four of them the tear ducts one the mouth and inflate the material into the form of a head now lets inflate the boundary of the final tube into the shape of a body with its opening in the rear and weve done it Music the human body is a seven hold doughnut or is it for every piercing you have thats one more hole in your body well two more if the piercing goes through a through hole like I dont know if you had a thin piercing into your face that went through a tear duct and came back out or if something like a bullet pierced into your chest through your esophagus and came out the other side that would mathematically count as two new holes and theres more some people have supernumerary lacrimal punctum on their eyes each additional punctum they have over four total adds an additional hole to the standard seven and remember the sinuses and the Ostia connecting them into the nasal cavity well theyre just blind holes depressions but as many as half of us may have at least one accessory ostium an extra hole connecting a sinus to the nasal cavity well now were talking about a through hole you can enter one opening and exit via another now these may not be external orifices but for every accessory Ostia you have thats another topological hole you need to add to your bodies total the thing is though most of us have no idea how many accessory Ostia we have unless youve had serious sinus problems or have had extensive scans of your nasal region that have been studied from multiple angles so to answer this videos question the human body has millions of blind holes like at least five million and at Birth seven through holes it would be better if there was a clear answer that applied to all of us for our entire lives or if finding out how many you had right now was easier but youll have to speelunk in your sinuses to know for sure and thats beautiful isnt it we can rigorously define the properties of holes in all sorts of dimensions and we can study that temperatures at the bottom of craters on Pluto but few of us will ever truly know the whole truth of our own bodies and as always thanks for watching Music

thisto people before  Hundreds of times And they were all okay They were all okay Yeaheverything worked out okay  All right Im ready Okay perfect Michael The protocol for fear conditioning  involves my being electrically shocked and startled  by the sound of a human scream  in connection to visuals I see on a screen  Bioelectric sensors  monitor my bodys physiological reactions  For example my perspiration an indirect measure of fear  that you cant consciously control Is this how you run thisat Caltech  Yes this is the exact laughs Exactly the same way  Minus the restraintsof course Oh the Oh okay Yeah Everything elseis solid fear conditioning  As your usual Yes Absolutely All right Im gameLets help science Michael The goal of this procedure  is to condition me to be scared of something  Ive never feared before  a mundane harmless geometric shape  something normal people dont find threatening at all  electricity cracklesrecorded scream Aaaah electricity cracklesrecorded scream Little bit more scaredof the square right now electricity cracklesrecorded scream Michael A clear pattern emerges  My senses are being assaulted  only when the purple square is onscreen electricity cracklesrecorded scream breathing heavily  But am I actually being conditioned  to fear a purple square electricity cracklesrecorded scream All right Michaelyoure all done  Hoo How was it Well it felt likeI was one of Pavlovs dogs I couldnt helpwhat I was doing and I was being trained to do itin response to something and that something was an otherwise very unassuminggeometric shape Exactly With Pavlovs dogshe had a bell and foodsomething positive at the end But in fear conditioningwe have something aversiveand negative at the end Michael And it worked  Once my brain associated the purple square  with being shocked  my physiological response to the square  went up and stayed up  The mere appearance of a simple geometric shape  made me scared enough to break a sweat The results show that youphysiologically really ramped up to that purple squarespecifically You quickly learned to be afraidon a physical level You showed fear I came in here todaynormal old Michael but Im leavingas a brandnew Michael who is afraidof purple squares The human braincan learn to be afraidof almost anything Michael To better understand how this works  we need to look at whats going on neurologically What happens in the brainduring fear conditioning Well what we knowis that over evolution over millions of years weve developed thesedefensive circuits in our brain And the amygdala sits onthe front of the memory systems of the hippocampus And the amygdala seemsto play an important role in determiningwhat the danger is of something in the world It tells us whatwe should be remembering what we should be learningthat is important to survival Michael Our brain actually has two amygdalae  one in each hemisphere  The function of the amygdalae  is at the center of fear research  which covers human behavior ranging from the risk averse  to high risktakers   like free soloist Alex Honnold Ancient humanswho avoided danger and survived long enoughto reproduce became our ancestors They populated the worldwith creatures like us organisms that instinctivelyavoid and are averse to potentially dangeroussensations Things like pain and being sick suffocationthe need to breathe We dont think those feel good and you dont have to learnto not like them Even a newbornis distressed by them which makes theminnate aversions Fear is the anticipationof these innate aversions  When the purple square was paired with electric shocks  my amygdala quickly made that association  and began consciously and unconsciously  arousing fear in me whenever I saw it For this reason I want us tothink of sensations as flies and our amygdala asa meaty little spider spinning a web of fear thunder crackling Michael The web is prestocked with our innate aversions  Whenever an experience is associated with an innate aversion  its like a fly landing on the web  This alerts the amygdala spider  which weaves a powerful connection  between that experience and the innate aversion  its associated with  In my case that innate aversion was pain  which probably isnt the scariest thing for everyone  because well some people have a high pain tolerance  Others can learn to suppress  their fear of pain  And of course some people enjoy pain  But the point is now that new experience  will stay trapped  in your web of fear  a new member of the library of things that scare you  To find the scariest thing we must wander through  the darkest recesses of the web Everything caught inyour web of fear is somehow connectedto death Avoiding itsurviving is after allwhat makes fear useful Its why we are still heretoday as a species So if death is atthe very center ofall of our webs of fear does that make deaththe scariest thing Michael Well although many people say death is their 1 fear  not everyone is afraid of it  Many acts of courage require caring more about others  than your own life  Some older people say theyre ready to die  And what about those who commit suicide  Sadly for them something else was scarier  than ending their own life So death isnt exactlythe answer were looking for The scariest thing willbe something else on allof our webs that is panicinducingeven to those who want to die projector whirring car rattling DangnabbitWouldnt ya know itIve run out of gas Guess Im just gonnahave to walk down thisdesolate foreboding road in search of a gas station Luckily this is just a movie My rational mindknows that Im safe and it will use that to inhibitmy amygdalas fear response laughsWhat a great way to make a horror film scarierright Take away one ofthe rational minds shields and the amygdalas fear responsewont be as inhibited What were about to seereally could happen and perhapswill Michael Of course we dont just learn fears  from firsthand experiences  Throughout our history we have used images and words  to teach fears to one another  to prepare the next generation for various dangers narrator These high school boy and girls  are having a hop at the local soda fountain  innocent of a new and deadly menace  lurking behind closed doors  Marijuana The burning weed  with its roots in hell Why do humanshave to tell storiesto share fears from generation to generationand person to person Language is virtual reality So when youtell someone a story youre not just describinga crocodile for example the language in the storyhas a kind of emotional impacton the listener So when I tell you somescary story about crocodiles the amygdala is being activatedby the words and the scenarios allowing the imaginationto sort of play with these ideas and scenariosso youre concocting imagery So it has a double whammy And youre gettinga very good sense that you should stay awayfrom this kind of thingin the future As a species were verydependent and vulnerablecompared to other animals We dont havesharp teeth and big clawsand were not really fast it takes us years and yearsto be selfsufficient So whats happening duringthose years of development is that were gettingall this information aboutthe environment through stories And part of thatis to know what to be afraid ofand what to not be afraid of projector whirring echoingHello Hey hellobird cawing Whoo Okay being aloneis kind of scary right But you know whatIm actually not aloneI am always connected  ominous motif plays  No reception Of course I mean what is thisa horror movie Yes it is And you know whatIm actually gettinga little bit scared right now A new fear by the wayhas developed in justthe last few decades You see a while agono one had a cell phone No one was ever connectedthrough the internet constantly But now many of usmost of us are And so thats the new normal and whats abnormal nowis not being connected not having your phone Psychologistsgive that fear a name its a real thingthats being studied and its called nomophobia Anyway the point is the scariest thing possiblehmm what could it be Well an important ingredientmight be fly buzzing  our innate aversion to isolation Why are we afraidof being alone Human beings are social animals We need each other to survive So if were alone it lessensour chances of survival And theres beena lot of research now that shows that when peopleisolate socially it actually leads to thingslike increased heart problems increased cancer riskphysical issues mortality It is very much directly tiedto the sense of survivaland avoidance of death What I find interestingabout isolation is I think it helps us capture a lot of tertiaryandbeyondfears that dont seem to bedirectly connected to death but are in a waythrough isolation For instancethe fear of public speaking Yes Well that tapsinto your fear of rejection and when you feel likepeople dont like youyou feel alone And so putting yourselfout there having that possible fearof rejection when youre speaking in public and not knowing how peopleare gonna perceive you thats very scaryfor a lot of people Which doesntnecessarily mean that you will directly die However it connectsto our innate aversionto isolation which through evolutionwe have learned is a bad thingthat can lead to death  And so were afraid of itavoid it Absolutely In the very first episodeof Mind Field I spent 72 hoursin an isolation chamber  For three days I had no contact with the outside world  I had no clock or window and the lights never went out The scariest part thoughwasnt being alone  I could handle that The worst part was being separatedfrom the natural cyclesof the Earth I was so accustomed to  Night and day Time  The disorientation and helplessness caused by that  made me distressed and may have been a reason why while in the roomall of my dreams also took placein the same room  I soon became unable to tell the difference  between when I was dreaming and when I was awake  I was terrified Extreme isolation like thatis not normal or healthy but we all respond differently There are people who loveliving by themselves in the middle of nowhere And with sufficient forewarningof the effects I think I could havehandled it better So just being all alone probably isntthe scariest thing So then what is projector whirring Ah You know whatwould make this scarier Perfect wolf howling fly buzzing Lets talk aboutfear of the dark Children and adultsand myself oftendont like the dark  No Why The sensory deprivation It leads you to feel likeyoure out of control like you dont knowwhats gonna be happening And at the same time predators tend tocome out at night so when we think backto caveman days they tend to attacklater on in the daywhen you cant see them And so theres a naturalinclination for usto fear the dark because we dont knowwhats lurking out there and theres a lot of thingsthat can come and hurt us My wife is pregnantright now I mean its pretty darkinside my wife Is my kid scared of the darkin there  Nope Nope Why Its comforting for themAnd in fact if a baby is colickythey cant be soothed if you put them in a dark roomthey calm down In factthis fear of darkness doesnt really come outfor most children until about the age of two Thats when I thinkthey start to developcertain cognitive and neural memories and maps about things that mightbe scary about the dark For example your parentstend not to be in bed with younecessarily Theyre goneSo these are the peoplewho were protecting you Well its darkyoure going to bed and they go to their roomand youre by yourself So to answer the questionWhats the scariest thingpossible the darkness isnt necessarilythe best one causeif a newborn walked in well I dont knowhow theyre walkingbut just go with me a newborn walks inits not gonna be likeAah Its dark Theyll just be likeHmm Right Hmm its kinda nice And you know who elseisnt scared of the darkA blind person Exactly So darknessIm crossing that off my list Not universal  projector whirring wolf howling Michael So if messing with our sense of sight isnt scary enough  what about our sense of hearing woman screaming OkayIm pretty scared right now But I could be more scared man screaming manically evil laughter chorus of screaming cackling Why is it so easyto condition a fearusing sound Sound has a specificneural pathway in the brain which goes fromthe auditory cortex thalamus straightinto the amygdala Now the funny thingabout sound is our visual systemallows us to see a threat and prepare for itbut sounds dont The rustle of some leaves the footsteps in the distance evokes anxiety it evokes a situation whichwe dont know how to respond because weve not seena threat yet we dont knowwhat it is  Much less information Yes thunder crashing  animal growls owl hoots Sound is a very immediateprocessing within the brain So a loud soundcreates a startlefor anybody immediately  staccato chord plays But also some of theseeerie sounds that youll hear they makethe hair on the backof your neck stand up its basically hijackingyour fear system very directly ethereal noise echoing Chchch ahahah  chchch ahahah Patrick Brice The first time I heard the chchch ahahah chchch fromthe Friday the 13th movies  that stuck with me forever  gasping man groans  thunder crashing  bucolic music playing Sean Cunningham  Music tells you how youre supposed to feel  slashing violins playing screaming And I believethat we are hardwiredto respond to music  In dramatic musical writing  you can use all kinds of different devices  ethereal sounds  Must be my imagination  to create fear  slashing violins play  screams Here I amwalking through the woods And here I amwalking through the woods with scary music  violin playing suspenseful motif Michael But if one note is scary  introduces dissonant harmonies  two notes can be even scarier  especially if theyre dissonant Dr Asma There are certain intervals  two notes that are clashing with each other  that universally bother people They put you in a kind of almostfightorflight situation Michael Musical intervals that fall  outside of conventional harmonies  may trigger our innate aversion to things that are different  or abnormal dissonance continues  This interval known as the Devils Tritone  is so dissonant that composers purposefully use it  to make listeners uncomfortable  from TV themes like The Twilight Zone  guitars play dissonant harmony  to hard rock like the start  of Jimi Hendrixs Purple Haze  guitar playing tritone motif raven cawing  But music doesnt always have to start out scary The right contextcan make even the happiest song absolutely terrifying dissonant version ofPop Goes the Weasel playing music continuesgirl humming along evil laughter Once a songhas been conditionedto elicit fear the effect can beextremely strongand longlasting For example the theme songfrom The ExorcistTubular Bells  Terrifying right Go listen to it its scary  But just a few months before the movie came out  it was a charttopping pop hit that audiences loved  because it was lighthearted and fun Oh strawberry Very good But heres the problemwith sound Not everyone has beenconditioned to be afraidof the same sounds or music and not everyone can hearwhat about the deaf Clearly the scariest thingpossible to everyone  will not be a sound   girl laughs evilly Take a look at these paintings We have a flirty little clown an abstract pieceand a landscape Now these paintingsmay seem a little bit strange but I wouldnt sayIm freaked out by them and I doubt you would either But now let me give youa bit more story the context behind these items This picture was paintedby John Wayne Gacy a serial killerwho tortured raped and killed 33 teenager boysand young men This was paintedby Chares Manson the infamous cult leaderwho convinced his followers to commit a series of ninehorrific murders in Los Angeles And this landscapewas painted by Adolf Hitler Your thoughts about these itemshave probably changed a bit Psychologists callthis phenomenon the Law of Contagion Its our tendencyto imbue objects with the qualities of the peopletheyre associated with Now before and afteryou heard the story the items were still madeof the same molecules and atoms but our minds use context to quickly endow themwith new powers Now these paintingscannot hurt you but the fact that the contextallows your amygdala spider to connect themto other fears and ultimately throughyour innate aversions to death means they take ona whole new meaning  The right story and context  can make almost any object person or place scary In fact let meask you a question What is this behind me Ah you know what This old camperisnt actually that scary Ahh nuts All right thingsare different now and Im starting to feel yep an automatic processis already happening to my body My amygdala nowassociates this trailerwith death and danger What Im feeling is actuallythe same thing that happens when you feel frisson Thats when youre greatly movedby something profound  Whats happening is that my amygdala  is telling my hypothalamus  to tell my adrenal glands  to start pumping adrenaline into my bloodstream  This makes my arrector pili muscles contract  which makes my hairs stand up  Now if my body were covered in thick fur like say a cat  this would make me look bigger and more threatening  But of course a long long time ago  we humans lost a lot of our fur  But we didnt lose this reflex  which makes it a vestigial reflex  something we dont need anymore but we still have  It is known as the Piloerection Reflex or more commonlygoosebumps  Anything thats different or abnormal can be scary Take it Georgie Michael Like Pennywise in It  oftentimes the scariest type of predator  isnt a human a creature or a beast  its a variation of a human being growling  a distorted human form that looks acts  or even moves in a disturbingly unnatural way Oh my God One thing many of usare terrified by is a distorted human form Why Our brain and our mind is a kind ofprediction processor Were trying to predictwhats gonna happen next So when anything comes inand it doesnt matchour template or sense of categories then were cognitivelyand emotionally aroused So it activates the amygdalait makes us a little suspicious or at least puts uson our toes again We have a genetic predisposition to be averse toor at least aroused by that which is outsidethe ordinary But when youre freshout of the womb you dont know whats normalor whats distorted and scary Researchers are Princetonand Florida Atlantic University demonstrated thisby showing normal faces and creepy distorted facesto babies  Children that were at least one year old  avoided looking at the scary faces which makes sense  But younger children  like those who were only eight months old didnt  The hypothesis is that at that age  normal hasnt yet been sufficiently established  A creepy face is just another thing to look at It only becomes creepywhen youve been aroundlong enough to know whats not creepy So when it comesto finding the one thing that can panic anyoneIll need to look elsewhere Because if a newborn babyrolls in here I wont be able to scare it even with the most vilescary unnatural face Of courseits not just faces Distorted natural formsalso include bodies like humanswith other animal parts creature growling Or creatures moving unnaturally Oh my  Oh my Hoo hoo hoo Oh my indeed You know whats going on here this is the third origin Fears can be born throughfirsthand experiences like feeling pain or informationallythrough stories but we can also learn fearvicariously by watching othersexperience fear Michael Its called Social Fear Transmission  and we tried it out out during my fear conditioning demonstration  Our unknowing subject was my good friend Alie Ward  Alie was invited to observe my experience  and witness my reactions  electricity cracklingrecorded scream Michael Jeez Okay little bit more scaredof the square right now Michael Right after my test  it was her turn to face the green circle  and the purple square  that appeared whenever I got shocked Dr ZbozinekWere gonna use the sameshock intensity  that Michael had Okay Michael Except that wasnt true  Alies test would not include any shocks or startling sounds Alie Is it normal to beshaking before this laughs Yeah its an anxietyprovokingtask Are you feeling okay  about doing it Mmmhmm Sure Michael Would Alie be afraid of the purple square  just from observing my fear of it  You ready Alie Mmmhmm All righty here we go I feel like Im gonna barf Michael Alie already seems scared  But is she just afraid in general  Or is she more afraid of the purple square  Which shape is making her sweat the most  Thats it Youre all done The shock fairydid not come to visit me The shock fairy did notcome to visit you laughingSo much adrenalinefor no pain My hands are sweating so muchthat the dye on my pantsis like on my hands now Michael So which shape scared Alie more  Despite receiving no adverse stimuli  but after observing my fear  she had a higher physiological response to the purple square  than the green circle You were definitelymore afraid of that purple squarethroughout the experiment Ahh You knowIm not a gambler but I think I was thinking I havent gotten shocked yetits coming People are always sayingthat they learn from me but its usually you know math or scienceor facts in general You learned fear I still hatethat purple square Youre welcome laughing Lets organizewhat weve learned so far Fear is a feelingthat we learn to have in response to thingsour amygdala figures we would do best to avoid because in one way or anotherthey could lead to our demise Strands of fearsilkhave connected them in some way to possible death Now from talking with expertsin my estimation there are eightunique innate aversions selected to engender panicin us by evolution over millions of years They come prelearnedin our DNA and include pain isolation the unknown or abnormal disease sudden movement suffocation falling and incapacitation These form the inner ringof the web of fear All our fearsfrom rats to radiation are based on connectionsmade by our amygdalae to death through one or moreof these innate aversions When it comes to learned fears there may be no limitto the number we can acquire As long as your amygdalakeeps spinning its threads the web can extend forever But heres whats even cooler when our learned fearsare combined just right they can be scarierthan the sum of their parts Researchers have foundthat if youve been conditioned to fear two separate stimuli say a purple squareand a green circle seeing them suddenly togethermakes you expect a worse outcome than seeing either stimulusindividually  Sidney screams Horror filmmakers  take advantage of this phenomenon  by employing a technique  called Category Jamming  mashing several categories of fears together  to create the scariest villains possible Dr Asma Theres people like Freddy Kreuger where youve got many thingsthat indicate death and fear  like you know the mottled flesh of his skin  the burn hes a ghost  his hands are blades of some kind  Youre weaving together a number  of very fearful associations that most people have   And his criminal past  Right All that together  Exactly squishy soundswhiplash sounds If you look at sort ofthe Alien franchise youllsee that the face hugger  that grabs onto your face is a beautiful hybrid of a spider and a snake  Those are two things that are universally feared  and so this is a kind of category jamming  It doesnt fit in our categories The designersbasically put them together so the fearis amplified tremendously Another example could bejust taking something that ordinarilywould never be hereand putting it there If you put snakeson a plane  youve got something most people are afraid of snakes  youve got flying which people are afraid of  Youve also got strange domain crossing Why would snakes be on a planeThat doesnt make sense And thats unsettlingin and of itself So youre weaving togethera number of very fearfulassociations that most people haveand thats uniquely disturbingI think So maybe extreme category jamming combining everyinnate aversionand conditioned fear could be the scariest thing It would certainly be likely tocatch anyone in a web of fear Lets try it out Now convenientlyIm already in a graveyard so we already havethe fear of death decay  church bells tolling its dark Im alone Lets add insome scary sounds  wolf howling growling a distorted human form sudden movement a mortal threat gore creature growling story and context growling growls incapacitation Is this it Is the scariest thing possible just a combinationof every innate aversion and conditioned fear laughing Oh dear Michael Conditioned fearsknow no bounds So the scariest thingis that the human mind can be made afraid of anything laughs evilly No Noooo Michael 3  Hold it Both of you stop Just Lets take a step back Category jamming togetherevery possible learned fear and every innate aversion just sounds like a copout I dont like thatI want to be more specific But this idea thatthe scariest thing is the fact thatthe human mind can be made afraidof anything I dont like that either I mean it might bethe scariest thing possible but it also might not What about peoplewho dont have an amygdala Meet Patient SM  Not the snake the hands  This is all we are allowed to show you   Her amygdala was destroyed at the age of ten  due to an incredibly rare genetic disorder And because she doesnthave an amygdala she cannot learn to registerexperiences as threats which puts her life in danger and thats whywe cant reveal her identity Patient SMs feelingsthe feeling states her subjective statesseem to be absent in Patient SM For examplewhen she was walkingthrough a park one night a guy came up to herand put a knife to her throat saying Give me your money And she just kindof ignored them and said Well if you cut meIll chase you downand kill you She was just all rational Yeah yeahAnd she apparentlykind of knows that this isnt right but she reactsin a different way Researchers have evenpurposefully exposed her to classically scary thingslike spiders and snakes and haunted housesand horror films and she has exhibitedno fear response to any of them whatsoever For a long time scientistsconsidered SM living proof that without an amygdalawe are unable to feel fear But then one experimentchanged everything Scientists have knownfor decades that a lack of oxygenwill make you feel dizzy and maybe even euphoricbefore you pass out But elevated levelsof carbon dioxide in the blood induce fear anxiety and panic Patient SM volunteeredto inhale concentrated CO2 Her brain interpretedthe elevated levels of CO2in her blood as proof thatshe was suffocating  a process we are innately averse to  As usual the researchers expected SM to feel no fear But for the first timein her adult life  she felt sheer and utter panic The great thingabout that study on SM is really it was the first time that we showed thatthese emotional responses can occur without an amygdala Over the courseof the next year the scientists tracked downtwo rare patients in Germany who also hadnonfunctioning amygdalae and gave them the sameCO2 inhalation test They hadthe same panic response  Researchers believe  that the fightorflight responses they observed  in these amygdaladamaged patients  were induced by CO2sensing neurons  in evolutionarily older regions of the brain  like the midbrain or even the brain stem  which control more primal physiological functions  And so if I want to terrify even the neurologicallyunscareable I need our bodysinternal fear response to elevated carbon dioxidelevels in the blood But the story doesnt end there SMs researcherslater discoveredsomething even weirder  When a control group of people with functioning amygdalae inhaled CO2  they showed a lower fear reaction than Patient SM Why Well this questionled to a potentiallyrevolutionary rethinking of the amygdalas role in fear Researches still believethat the amygdala learnsto detect threats  that are outside the body  so that the body can respond to them  but when it comes to internal threats  it may actually inhibit your fear response  The control subjects knew they were participating  in a safe voluntary experiment  so their amygdalae may have effectively told other parts of their brain Hey relaxThings are bad in the body but I dont detecta real external threatso like calm down A panic responseisnt gonna helpnot warranted So if you want to ensurethe utmost amount of panicin the most people you dont need to category jam every possible scaryand unpleasant thing together you only need two of them Increase a personsblood CO2 levels and present an external threattheyll believe is causing it Drowning Waterboarding Coerced CO2 inhalation Theyre all variationsof the one true scariest thing  elevation of carbon dioxide in the blood  caused by an uncontrollable external threat

I Watch 3 Episodes of Mind Field With Our Experts & Researchers,2019-10-14T16:00:06Z,180.26666666666668,8630923,85801,soft music eerie sound  Hey Vsauce Michael here Every episode of MindField is now free to view all over the world all 24episodes all three seasons Whoa It is really exciting And its why Ive invited youhear to Vsauce headquarters Why watch Mind Field alonewhen you could watch it with me and some of the researcherswriters scientists and teachers whoare in the episodes who made Mind Field what it is Thats right we are about to have ourselvesa Mind Field marathon We are going to watch threeepisodes in their entirety pausing throughoutto talk more deeply about the conceptsin the episodes its gonna be very exciting and its all going to happenright in here follow me After you eerie sound Were going to beginwith an episode that helped new researchhappen and improved the lives of some very special children Season Two Episode Sixthe Power of Suggestion upbeat music This is McGill Universityin Montreal Canada It boasts and enrollment of more than 40000students from 150 countries the campus employs1700 professors teaching 300 programs of study and its proud to be hometo 12 Nobel Prize winners it is considered one of the finest researchuniversities in the world Recently researchers at McGill have embarked on a study thatuses a brain scanning device to read peoples mindsand implant thoughts into their heads or sotheir subjects think Now the same device may be able to help kids with ADHD anxiety Obsessive Compulsive Disorder migraines Tourettes and more This study is notabout technology The MRI machine behindme may look impressive but its a sham itsdeactivated non functioning What this study is reallyabout is faith in science Its about the powerof thoughts to heal All you need is thepower of suggestion machine humming upbeat music A placebo is somethingthat shouldnt work but due to thepower of suggestion and because of the strengthof our belief does but we dont fullyunderstand yet how they work there could be anevolutionary explanation For example if a smallchild hurts themselves negative symptoms like painand crying can be good They keep the childsafe and still while signalingadults to come help When help arrives even ifit has no active effect The childs brain mayfeel it has permission to redirect resourcesaway from seeking help and on to actually healing Modern medicine hasfound a way to harness this power byprescribing placebos But not all placeboswork the same For example a sugar pillwill help your headache more if given to you by a doctorthan by a poker buddy and the color of theplacebo matters too A blue pill will workto make you feel calm better than a white pill because blue is amore calming color And a red pillwill keep you awake and give you more energythan a blue pill will A capsule will workbetter than a pill because it looks more important upbeat music And were gonna stop right there because one of my guestsalready has a comment Let me first introducewho the guests are Daniel Toker is a PhDcandidate at Berkeley who has been writing andresearching for Mind Field at least season two and three  Yep Yeah  Yep and the Fearepisode season four  And the Fear episodewhich isnt even out yet but it might be by thetime you watch this in which case its out already Thanks Daniel On the far right side wehave Elisabeth de Kleer who worked on season threeas a producer writer Shes a science communicatorscience documentary filmmaker but I save the middle for last because Dr Samuel Veissière from the Culture Mind andBrain lab at McGill University one of the CO directors is here And hes also goingto be featured quite prominentlyin this episode Youll see him soon And he is the one whotold me Stop lets talk because were gonnatalk about placebos And I just mentioned in theepisode that the color of a pill affects how itcan make you feel A blue pill will tendto be more calming because so many of usassociate blue with calming However we need to be when you put a staron so many of us  Yeah so reportedly in Italy blue pills donthave a calming effect because peopleassociate the color blue with the soccer jersey ofthe national soccer team So they tend to associate it with a kind of a feeling ofarousal and not calmness So its interestingto try to parse out the different effectsof some colors Red seems fairly universal as something that triggershigh arousal but not blue  Is that because red is thecolor of blood you think  Im really not sure I mean as you know we seem to have some inbuiltattentional biases towards red like say the little buzzingred lights on smartphones works really well that way because we tend toautomatically attend to them It could be bloodyeah could be fire even because we also have anattentional bias towards fire  Wait but howuniversal is this Have studies lookedat Papua New Guinea and populations there thatdont watch the movies and dont have the stories that we have inAmerica or in Europe I mean is this somethingthat you said in built Is it really  Im not aware ofall the studies I think red forsure is something for which we have a relativelyinnate attentional bias red processeses salientin the environment  This is so much of itdepends on the person like there could be aperson here in America for whom red is really calming because of theirparticular circumstances  Yeah its actually funny I just got back fromChina yesterday So I flew in And one of the things younotice even from the sky looking down over Chinese cities is how much red lightingthere is big red LEDs And so I associate redwith stop like if red its meant to catchmy attention Itssort of alarming But in China actuallyits ubiquitous And its more just likea color of good luck Most restaurantshave their title of the restaurant in red So its also meant tocatch your attention to simulate arousal but inless of like a negative way that it can sometimes behere in the United States so red street sign isntnecessarily gonna be  So probably the emotionalvalence is conditioned and culturallycontingent on some level But that red isgonna be salient is gonna be something that wecan automatically attend to Thats fairly universal  And once we attend to ithow we feel may depend a lot on the culture that were from  Right  But I think the point isthat even things like the color and size and shape of a pill and who gives it to youwill affect how it works Its not just the chemicalproperties of the medicine theres so much more somuch in the mental world  Well I mean but that alsois chemical ultimately right Because if its ablue pill or red pill thats gonna affect yourneuro chemistry in some way  And you know whatwhy is it red or blue Because of the physicalshape of the molecules The shape Right  Wow So right I guess thisis gonna be a question I wanna keep coming back to how do we reallydefine a placebo Because I think in the episode I say something liketheres no active ingredient that should cause that effect But yet if a pill is calming because it happens to be blue because its molecular structure reflects blue light the best then there is somethingchemically in that pill that works in calming you And its not becausethe ingestion helps its just the color alone  Right right I guess its easier todefine whats not a placebo as something that worksbetter than a placebo  Well thats why anotherterm for placebo effects are nonspecific effectsor nonspecific factors So whatever factorsinvolved in healing that we cannot attributeto the chemical substance that is targetedin the treatment And there are also non specificeffects in psychotherapy even that are so tone ofvoice setting waiting times So placebo isreally a filler term for all these differentpsychosocial symbolicritual factors that we dont fully understand but that we know contributeto a cure somehow  Right So those are called nonspecific the specific ones How are they defined they are  So the specific one would be the actual analgesicproperty of a pill for example has beenwell studied in RCT we know it produces that effect But then we know that thereare other effects around and beyond that that alsocontribute to healing And in the case of anactual placebo procedure where we know thatspecific molecule is not actuallypresent in the pill but healing will still happenthen we need to investigate these different effectsthese different factors That are nonspecific  Maybe this worksa nonspecific non placebo effect of amedicine would be what works even when its administeredto someone in a coma who doesnt knowwhats happening doesnt know whosadministering it But we know that thatmolecule in the blood causes bloodpressure to go down or whatever causes pain tobe felt less I dont know  But be carefulbecause there are placebo effects havebeen found for example in nonverbal autistic children who for sure cannot understandthe nature of the suggestion because of course if youhave some kind of an idea about a therapeutic targetand a mechanism of action so I have a headache and this one pillremoves the headache then that will greatlyhelp in the placebo effect But what about the case ofautistic nonverbal children who have no idea whodont expect anything and yet theres an effect theres a social cognitivecomponent to placebo effects you have to be able to expect what other people expectof you even implicitly So probably in the case of thenonverbal autistic children its also say the reassuringtone of voice of the parent the parents shiftedexpectations the sort of contagioushope that might work And the same mechanismsame social mechanism might be involved in dogs andin advanced social species through observation and kindof social emotional contagion  Very cool All right guys letsget back into the episode You ready Here we go Also an injection willwork better than a capsule because it seems moreserious and potent Theres even evidence that fake or Sham surgerieshave positive effects It may be fake medicinebut the effects can be real And not just because the patient feels better psychologically were talking realphysical healing thanks to thepower of the brain  Dr Samuel Soagain briefly can I say something Michael  Michael Yeah lets stop  Well Im really gladyoure pointing out all these differentdimensions of placebo effects the take home point here is that the more elaborate theprocedure the better it works And by elaborate I mean sotechnologically elaborate but also motivationallyelaborate So if it hurts a little bit if you have to waita long time for it if it seems reallysymbolically prominent also So whatever prestige mightbe attached to a procedure that will tend to work betterand also socially elaborate So if you can noticeimprovements in other people preferably people like youpeople from your in group you can talk to themthat will also help prepare you for theplacebo response  Its amazing It makes it feel like whyeven study real medicine when so much of just theway people think about it can make a difference Clearly there arelimits to that And I wanna revisit thatwhen we start looking at the actual study thatwe did in this episode because talk about making it feeltechnologically interesting Weve got a wholefilm crew there Why would a film crew be hereunless its gonna work well Well talk about that soon Well get right back intoit The Power of Suggestion I traveled to Montrealto meet local children struggling withdebilitating behavioral and neurological conditionswho would soon find out whether their afflictionscould be cured by the power of suggestion  This is Malaya  Malaya Im MichaelNice to meet you 12 year old Malaya suffers from a common skinailment eczema but she has also developeda skin picking disorder Dermatillomania And youre starting High School What like this year Early September  Wow thats a big step So what kind ofthings worry you Given the symptomsthat you have  Probably the picking Of your skin  Yeah I dont know Ifind it satisfying to pick Its kind of gross  Why do you cant stop  Im not sure  Have you tried differentthings that will help you stop  Yeah like in my mind Im just like todayyou wont pick You are gonna getrid of this eczema And then after Im just like Oh wait my face was bleeding  Yeah is it embarrassing  Yeah I like towear long sleeves because my arms are likeif theyre really bad Im gonna try towear long sleeves  How are your arms now  Its like really badso as you can see  And thats all just fromscratching and picking  Yeah  12 year oldNicholas was troubled by debilitatingmigraine headaches So what do you wannabe when you grow up  Like I really really wanna be probably a NHL and MOVplayer one of those two  Nicholass love of sports is unfortunately alsothe original sourceof his suffering Nice  My first head injurywhich was concussion I hit my head on a soccer post and then I hit my headin a game of hockey After that I had headachesevery single day I was throwing up having auras Theyre like colorsthat you seen before you have a headache I wasnt able to go to school and then we went to the hospital and into theirconcussion program  Can I see his migraine chart  Oh sure yeah we havealmost two years worth severe headaches here Severe migraines Every day  Every single day this hasturned his world upside down  Nathan was diagnosed with ADHD and impulse control disorder Id love to hear especiallyabout you Nathan First of all how old are you  Nine Nine  How old you are   Michael How olddo you think I am  30  Thats a verygood guess Im 31  Oh  So tell me about likebefore Nathans diagnosis What were kind of thesymptoms you were seeing  Tantrums all the time Just an inability to reach him to communicate to himto connect to him That was the main symptom  And what did youthink of this Nathan Were you like why aremy parents not happy  Cause I was not listening  Why werent you  I dont know maybebecause I had problems  And as far as like behavior  Impulsivity hyperactivity youre always always onthe edge always stressed What is he gonna touch Where is he gonna go What is he gonna do  These families hadtried conventional methods to treat their childrenwith little success But they were about to findout whether their symptoms could be alleviated using anaccessory assisted placebo a fake non functioningMRI machine This groundbreaking studyof the power of suggestion in action is the brainchildof pioneering researchers at McGill Universitysesteemed Raz Lab  We study a whole bunch of different MindBody interaction topics suggestion hypnosisplacebo effects anytime the mind is regulatingthe body or vice versa that thats atopic that we study  Now you saidthe word placebo And the device that we areusing is a sham scanner Tell me about the scanner  What we do withthe MRI scanner is we stack so many differentlayers of deception In their head this is aproper neuroscience study done at theNeurological Institute And thats why wewear a lab coats Thats why we have all of thisscientific looking equipment By the time theyveactually started the study Theyve already intheir mind built up all these differentlayers of credibility They really believe thatwhat were doing is real  Whats interestingis that children theyre not immune to thepower of neuro enchantment  Neuro enchantment Neuro enchantment  What does that mean  So its this idea that there is somekind of medical magic there is immensepower that is attached to the culture of neuroscience whereby neuro scientificprops and accessories have more healing powermore physiological effects because culturally peoplebelieve that they do I mean the same kinds ofcultural cognitive mechanisms are at play inreligious systems So here we are praying to the gods of neuroscienceand biomedicine  Talk to me aboutthe ethics of lying  The work we do with children actually does not involve lying we tell them at first thateverything that they see and everything thatwe do in the lab is a suggestion weexplained to them that suggestion is a way to tap into the power of their mind And we keep emphasizing evenas they go in the scanner that it is theirmind and their brain that is doing the healing that theyre basicallyreprogramming their own brain  The parents knew thatthe scanner was a placebo But for the study to work the children had tobelieve in the procedure So before they visited the lab I enlisted a fewYouTuber friends to help raisetheir expectations  Hey guys today we havea huge surprise for you about somethingbrand new in science that could affect your day  Oh I know them  Well today we learnedabout this amazing new machine that teaches kids brainhow to heal super fast  We really hope that youget a chance in person to see how this machine works  With a little helpfrom the machine you can focus better youcan be more confident and it can even takeaway some headaches  Awesome  Not too manypeople get the chance to have this awesome experience but we hear thescientists in Canada  I gonna have it Yeah and its very cool So what do you hope themachine allows you to do It makes you better at  Better at concentratingbetter at focusing  I wanna heal faster andthis probably be a good idea  All right so I wanna talkabout a couple of things One this episodeis really different from a lot of MindField episodes because weretreating people in it And were followingtheir stories A ungenerous way to look atthis is that in this episode were lying to children and performing fakemedicine on children Dr Veissière whatare your thoughts  So if you carefully examinewhat we say it is correct that we never tell a lie that we explain themechanism correctly However to becompletely honest we do probably relyon the childrens to some extent uncritical faith in the healingpower of the machine on the one handand their own brain And this is because we know itis very effective for people to be able torelax their worries and their criticalthinking and to surrender to some kind of anidea that they have of an external locus of control Now note here how boththe brain and the machine are basically an agency otherthan their conscious self So we tell them the machine will helpyour brain heal itself it is your brain thatis doing the healing But it is much more efficient for the children toat least initially believe that the machine hassome kind of special power  I think I even remember youtelling me that you would tell the parents flat out themachines not even plugged in And then the next day thatthey came in they would say but is this safe Because how can it be safe Were in the basementof a neuroscience lab and this machine is really bigand noises are being played  Not even that they would ask so did you find out whatswrong with my childs brain They wanted us to commenton neuro imaging results And we would have topull them aside again and say do to remember Were not doingactual neuro imaging were not youve competentto comment on findings that are not even therethey would forget  They would forget  They would forget becauseall the queues are in place And I think it would demandso much mental effort to remember that this is sham that people revert to a kindof adaptive self deception So this is also whatwere aiming for Were aiming to tap intothe childrens ability to self deceive which weknow can be very effective like say if yourereally really nervous before giving a talkand then you managed to convince yourselfthat youre not nervous then lo and behold youstart feeling confident Now initially there mighthave been some self deception But then if theresults are good then its no longer deception  This is what I reallylove about all the episodes and all the work thatweve done together Because we also workedon the reverse exorcism putting a spirit insomeone that okay In a way were almostfinding some truth to pseudo scientific practices If I have some mental blockor some behavior I dont want And my mother takes meto a person who prays to crystals and whatever that crystal has nochemical mechanism with which to help me However if I truly believethat this is significant and I noticed thatIm being cared for that people care so much and I think so muchmore about my behavior because of all of that Ican actually get better And thats whatwere doing here But instead of usingcrystals and whatever were using science lookingstuff lab coats and an MRI and imaging of brains onthe computer screens around and it just feels like thismust be serious and real But in reality they mayas well be laying on a bed while someone singsnonsense words to them  And I like theparallel that you draw Its true that a lot ofspiritual healing practices they draw on thesetransitional objects you could call them sothings like amulets or stones or rocksor even magic crosses that people can sortof attribute healing power to without having to worry it becomes a convenient wayto instill hope in people  All right lets getright back into it  I hope he heals mewith my concussions and now I hope myheadaches go away  I was about to take partin something remarkable The very first use ofaccessory assisted suggestion on children with thesekinds of symptoms Mind Field would play anintegral role in the study and the results could be newand significant for science upbeat music On the day of the first session several measureswere put in place to heighten the childrensneuro enchantment  Nathan  Nathan  Michael Afriendly fake nurse a walk down a longimpressive hallway Malaya exhaling And a 10 minute anticipationbuilding wait outside the lab then it was time fortheir first scan  Doctor Shall we  Michael While the hypothesis of this study wasgrounded in science This was Dr Veissièreand Jay Olsens first time testing their theory on real childrenwith real disorders And they didnt knowif it would work  You may lay downif youd like  I have a question so itseems to me that placebos work in part becausepeople these subjects have a lot of faithin medical science Did you study that at all Or ask them at all about that I mean and I guessmy question is for somebody whos veryskeptical of medical science who doesnt feel like doctorsare working to their benefit would they still be assusceptible to a placebo  Well a lot ofpeople might say theyre criticalof medical science But for example if theyhave acute appendicitis their first intuitionwill be to rush to the ER And for belief tobe really effective it needs to beculturally widespread And we happen to livein a historical moment where most of the solutionsto our everyday ailments are deemed to befound in medicine and children are receptiveto these kinds of cues even implicitly even if theydont know that they know So I think try it outat home for example if you have like afive year old niece show her a picture of a builder and then a doctorwith a stethoscope and ask your niece whichone is the smartest For sure theyre gonnapoint to the doctor because theyve picked upon a cultural consensus that this is whereelaborate knowledge lies At the same time Imnot aware of any studies testing medicalplacebos on people who are reallyskeptical of medicine who are completely intoalternative medicine it may be that itwouldnt work with them I think its a good hypothesis  Also is there such athing as an anti placebo Where laughs andwhat I mean by that  For sure Yeah okay So thats like somebodywhos skeptical so even something thats potent even if you give them a potentdrug they dont react to it because theyre soskeptical about it  Yeah rightthats another thing nocebo is something different What is that though Where because of all thedone specific crap surrounding a chemical mechanism thatshould work it works less well because of the context  Thats really interesting Yeah that might veryvery interesting And it may be that people who are a little too highin analytical reasoning people who are notvery suggestible people who are not veryprone to social influence may also reverse placebothemselves inadvertently because theyre too critical because they cant let theself regulatory magic happen But it could be thatat the social level or naive beliefs insome things like say some categories of illness that may not bescientifically validated But just because people believethey have these symptoms like say certainfood intolerances or certain allergies thatappear to be on the rise Well theres somepsychogenic factors involved in that and then mighthave something to do with collective nocebo effects And then the next problemis also letting people know that theyre genetically atrisk for a particular condition sometimes maytrigger the symptoms or may even triggerthe condition in a way that not knowingmight have been better  Ignorance is bliss  Ignorance is often bliss  I think its veryethically tricky then  Its very ethically tricky because you have to tell people but then there are also risksassociated with telling  Thats why youmight not wanna do a personal genetics test  Right Well were about to testthat in the lab as well because we thinktheres interesting neuro enchantment effects associated withbelief in genetics So were about to do a study with Sham personalized feedback So Sham swab and genetic its a placeboanalgesia condition So we give peoplea shock and pain And we tell them thatin one condition weve tailored the machine to one particular geneticpolymorphous that they have and we fully expectthat is gonna work better in that conditionbut we havent tested it yet And then eventuallyone of our dreams is to also test in a kind of three on trial todo Sham neuroimaging versus Sham genetic testing to see which one hasthe strongest effect  Ah Whats your hypothesis Which do you think we asa society believe more in Neuroimaging or genetic testing  Im really not sure I think were moving towards believing more ingenetic testing but the belief mightstill be culturally new Whereas belief in thepower of neuroscience are very wellinstalled culturally were more than two decadesafter the decade of the brain So I would say in 10 years itll probably begenetic testing For now it dependson levels of exposure But for sure likesay for children the idea of a gene isstill very very opaque very nebulous very esoteric whereas putting them inthis enormous machine and this authoritativehospital might  Might always be better thanjust swabbing their mouth and telling them something Lets get back into theepisode you guys ready Okay here we go One of my roles wasto help build up the childrens beliefthat it would work As you go into the machineyoull relax more and more Would you like to relaxslowly or quickly today  I can go in quickly  Quickly Oh Wow nice  Very good Although the MRI scannerwas completely deactivated we needed the kids to believeit was fully functional So Jay played a series ofrealistic sound effects to signify that themachine was working While Dr Veissièreplanted the suggestion that it would helpthe patient heal  You may notice some unusualfeelings perhaps a tingling your brain is continuingto learn and to heal And to help you find thisconstant feeling of confidence  Michael If all went well the placebo effect ofthe Sham brain scanner would convince thechildrens conscious minds that real neurosciencewas at work  A deep deep breath  Michael This would allowtheir subconscious minds to harness the power of theirbrains to heal themselves  For people with migrainesits often in the front or the back part of thehead but it could also be like a feeling likeoutside the head So Im not sure what itsgonna be like for you Well find out afterwards So well now slide you in  Cool its likea roller coaster I love roller coasters  The deeper you go inthe more youll relax  Okay I wanna goall the way deep I feel more stronger beeps  I know this is because yourealready at level three You might notice a deeperfeeling of relaxation  Nathan Yes I can feel it Can we go a littlebit deeper please  Michael Yes  Nathan I wantmy whole entire feet Nice  Michael Thescientists at McGill believe the childrens brainshave always had the ability to control their symptoms The children just neededto believe it themselves Nathan sneezing  Dr VeissièreYeah so the beeps can sometimes make people sneeze as a sign that theyrerelaxing just very deeply Right Very well you didvery very well Nathan  Michael The children allappear to enjoy the procedure and the researchersand I did our best to reinforce theirneuro enchantment  So when you heard thethe first set of beeps and the second set of beeps Did you notice feeling them indifferent parts of your body  Well the first timeI went in the machine I kind of felt the hair  Okay good  What level wasshe taken to today  Level two  Level two  Dr Veissière Yeahlevel two is great yeah  Michael Yeah  When I was in themachine I felt like I was going backwardsand forwards  Okay thats very goodthats very good sign You might have noticedhow you were yawning  I wanna go to sleep  Thats great  Michael For a kidwith hyperactivity Nathan was alreadyappearing calmer But before our youngsubjects left the lab Dr Veissière bolstered thesuggestion that todays session would help them continuetheir healing process  So I know for sure thatyoure gonna be more relaxed much much less anxious Iwould not be surprised at all If the scratchingreally diminished tono scratching at all The amazing thingabout the brain is that it has this fantasticpower to heal itself But now what wevebeen able to do here with the power of suggestionis to get your brain to work faster andbetter all the time So how do you feel  Amazing  Dr Veissière Oh nice  Michael Mind Fieldprovided the Raz Lab with Octopus byJoy Smartwatches  Nathan Lefty rules  Michael They werespecially programmed to remind the childrenin between visits that their brainwas healing itself  Just having the watch withyou will make you feel better But its not the watchor its not the machine thats making you feelgood its your own brain  Okay I just stoppedit because I wanna say at this time whenthis was filmed smart watches were like awhole cool brand new thing Everyone was excitedthe kids were like Oh And we had to be like itsnot like an Apple Watch its just for your brainhealth which is better Tell me about the watches because I dontthink in the episode we focused enough onwhat their role was  The idea was to workon placebo conditioning So first we enlisted aresponse in the scanner with a mixture ofhypnotic suggestions anticipation and all theeffects that you showed Now once weve found a targetresponse like say relaxation or self regulationsome other way then we get thekids to expect that when they receive a littlebuzz from the watch Theyre going tokeep experiencing whatever effectwe were listening So usually respect relaxationfocus and so forth So then we programmeddifferent delivery schedules for the children where theywould get a little buzz and a little friendly icon and then it would remind themOh I guess Im doing great And then we had them come back after two weeks in the library I would decrease the deliveryschedule of the buzzes because I didnt want them tobecome too addicted to them And eventuallyafter a third week there would be no more buzzes So they could playaround with the icons because I didnt want themto rely on the buzzes But then yeah asyou pointed out a lot of the kids stillwanted to have the watch as a kind of a transitionalobject like a little blanky that helps yousleep or an amulet or a special ringthat people have  You may have heardus say a few times Oh youre at level three Today you got to leveltwo is completely made up There were no levels But yet the kids reallyread a lot into that  And then they becamemore and more proud each time they knowthey went deeper And they surrenderthemselves to the  Well of course they didbecause no matter what happened or how they felt theywere told thats good Oh wonderful oh really  We were validatingeverything they felt  Every thing  Was the level thing planned Or what thatimprovised on camera  No we kind of I thinkwe improvised it on camera And then we stuck to it Because we saw thatit worked really well  Well yeah I just allowed Samuel toguide the whole thing I sat there and Iwould just back him up Im wearing a lab coat as well So I go uh oh wow And it was almost hardsometimes to not laugh because hed be like Ah yes Well ohyou feel sleepy Oh that meansyoure very advanced And Id be like hesaid about everything laughing It was so funny And I was always excitedto see what level he would say they reachbecause it gave me a sense of how much further youwanted to go with them  Right right And because as you rememberwe had many more kids than we what endedup showing on camera And we had great resultswith all of them  Right so letstalk about that So you see three childrenfeatured here in this episode But I believe there wereseven eight or nine that we actually worked with  There were 12  there were 12 Okay not all 12 could fit into the time constraintsin that episode Thats partly why Iwanna have this marathon so we can talk more  You remember Mikey Really really hyper really difficult toget him in the machine And still there were lots andlots of improvements at home he was able to take ashower for the first time he made a friend at camp And the watch in particularworked really well with him because he wasvery focused on it And I made him work reallyhard to earn that watch So by the time he got the watch he was already going inthe machine he was calmer he was morerespectful to his dad  I think I rememberthe parents the dad saying okay so wereached a point where your goal was to get the watch off the kid that you dont need to watchafter all your own brain your own self can control this But people really wantthose accessories And the parents were like Well I mean could youtell them to keep it on Because it keeps the kid calm and it makes themmore thoughtful And it makes them moreaware of their behavior  You have kids right Mmhmm  Do you use any of thesetactics on your own kids  Absolutely our very firstsubject was my son Mathias who suffered fromchronic migraines And we did a lot of work on him And we had amazing resultson his chronic migraines Mathias he couldnt make it in the final cut of the episode But he also helped in theinitial study as a child mentor because we found that a lotof the kids were terrified of getting into the machine But then if they couldspeak to another child who had gone throughthe procedure and who could talk abouthow fun and safe it was and how hed gotten better then we were able tohave much better results So we use this kind ofpeer mentoring strategy that were still usingactually in the studies that were running now But yeah for sure I usethese kinds of tricks And I give placebos to mychildren all the time  And then you have your kidspeddle the placebos to others because youre right wedont show Matia Mathias  Mathias yeah  We dont show Mathias inthe episode but he was there And man the kids believed himso much more than the adults If he said Yeah I getin their like every day or whatever his schedule was he was honest about all of this and he was honest about thegood results he was getting Although lets be very clear this MRI is just a piece ofplastic it is not plugged in It does not havethe liquid helium in their magnets inanything its just plastic  And Mathias at the time heparticipated in this study was still blindto the condition meaning that he wasstill somewhat convinced that there wassomething to the machine even though heunderstood the language he understood theconcept of suggestion but theres a part of him that didnt wannathink about that fully  How can this onlybe a suggestion ifIm in the basement of a neuroscience labwith this big machine Clearly theyre lyingwhen they tell me the truth that this is a placebo All right lets get backinto it you guys ready Here we go In six weeks we wouldreturn to the lab to check in on their progress upbeat music This high techcontraption is pretty much what McGill universitys first Sham brainscanner looked like It was an olddiscarded hair dryer But the patientsdidnt know that In the original study 56undergraduate students were told that it was able to reducepain cause amnesia influence sexual attraction and produce variousother impressive effects The labs new moremodern sham brain scanner shows even more promise andI was invited to participate in its test on a whole newgroup of adult subjects soft music  Okay so you can come inhere and just grab a seat  Michael These collegestudents are fully aware of whats possibletoday with neuroscience Could even they beneuro and chanted enough to believe in the impossible that an MRI scanner couldread their thoughts Now were looking at cuttingedge psychological research  Okay Yes Its part of the neuralactivation mapping project Were gonna beputting you in an MRI So its a modified oneits called a CTMS FMRI  Okay  So Combined TranscranialMagnetic Stimulation Functional MagneticResonance Imaging which is a big word just meaning it can both read andinfluence thoughts  All right okay  So youll be choosinga number from 10 to 99  Okay  And then from looking at yourneural activation patterns Dr Veissière herewill try to infer which number youre thinking  Interesting okay Okay great  Michael Mostadults know the basics about MRIs so we madesure to cover every detail  In the scanner themagnetism is a lot less this is good for thedocumentary team because it means theycan bring cameras so that said we do have toremove the metal gadgets  Got it all these  Michael Afterthis realistic but completely unnecessary step it was time to begin ourfake mind reading experiment eerie sound  So were gonnastart the calibration so try to stay very still  Michael Of course there was actuallynothing to calibrate but we were conditioningour subjects with the expected procedures sights and soundsof a real MRI study beeping sound Okay think of the number one  Michael Thesubjects were asked to concentrate on thenumbers zero to nine while the machine supposedlymapped parts of their brains  Think of the number nine  Michael Dr Veissière and I remained in characterat all times pretending to analyze thesubjects brain activity but the images on ourscreens were actually old MRI scans fromformer patients  Jay Is the calibration good  It looks pretty good to me  With our subject now primedit was time to convince her that the scanner couldidentify a number she was thinking ofby reading her mind  Youre gonna choosea number from 10 to 99  Okay  Youre gonna hear a beepthen youll hear a second beep So youre alwaysmaking your decision between the two beeps  Okay  Good Got it  So Ill slide you in soft music beep So hold on to thatnumber for just a second  Okay  Theyre gonna print itout and then well see  Okay  It was pretty clear  Michael we pretendedto give Jay the results of the MRIs analysisbut actually Jay was about to add thesubjects number to the document with a little sleight of hand  Okay so you can say lyingdown just for a second What was the number  31  31 okay cool So if you can set up here  What laughing  So its pretty closebut its swapped uh  Yeah okay  Michael That misswas actually intentional So the results didntappear to be perfect Adding to the realism  So youre doing well welldo another trial of this The same thing okayIll slide you in upbeat music  Michael Michellethought of a new number will the scanner getit right this time  Super clear  Its clear Really good this time  Jay All right theythink the signal is clear What was your number  27  Uh 27 did you say  27  Okay great yeah soif you can set up here  Yes oh wow What I dont understand crazy  So you chose 27 I did  And technician got 27 as well  Yeah well okay Yeah Mitchell laughing  Oh wow how does that feel  I didnt expect itto be so specific A lot of different areas inthe brain could be lighting up Just think of theconcept of a number  Michael What doyou know it worked thanks to the wondersof science or rather the skills of Jay who in addition tobeing a neuroscientist happens to be a professionalmagician on the side Well Jay wont revealthe secret of the trick The mind readingillusion is very similar to The Mentalist tricks that have entertainedaudiences for over a century The only differenceis that when audiences see the stunt performedin a magic setting they think its a greattrick not real science  The machine had 89 laughing  Thats cool  Michael Howeverin the impressive scientific settingof the Raz Lab these subjects thought ourmagic trick was real science  Oh my god laughing  Michael They didnt realize that the real sciencethey were experiencing  Its pretty cool  Michael Was thepower of suggestion  Wow  A dose of neuroenchantment this powerful can make for a formidableand effective placebo I want some of thephysical sensations  Sure  What was your experience  I felt like theheadache was coming on I sort of felt liketingling through my head  Where  Just through this area Like this whole areafelt more like full  I felt like a sort ofpressure or something like that a strange feeling  Back here a little bit  Michael In the back  Yeah a littlebit in the back  Somewhere in the back ofthe head right interesting  Some tingling inside my head  Okay  I wanna hear what it feltlike to have your mind read  That was very strange I think I was probablyskeptical like going into it And then I couldnt figure outas I was thinking like why how that would happen otherwise And so Im just I thinkin a baffled state laughing  Yeah yeah It was time to clear upthis baffling mystery So some deception hasbeen going on today Dr Olson is not reading yourmind neither is this machine This machine is deactivated All the noises werecoming from a speaker  It was anillusion oh my God laughing Thats pretty cool  Dr Olson is notreading your mind  Oh no  The sounds yourehearing are not magnets Its just from a speaker The machine in there isactually deactivated its not working  Well its like placebo  Yeah thatsexactly what it is Now imagine tapping intothis power for other effects like healing for example  Right wow  Im definitely believethe placebo effect is alive and well laughing  All right sowe just saw adults being fooled andcertainly lied to However the cool thing is thatwhile we punked the adults we used that same phenomenonfor good with the children And we dont deceivethe children we just allow them todeceive themselves I still dont know howthe magic trick is done And I never askedbecause its his trick not mine to know But when the participantssaid the number they were thinking of he managedto somehow get it written on that sheet and the timeit took him to be like yep thats what it saidand it was phenomenal And then to hear people say Oh yeah no I felttingling my head felt full Its like you werejust laying on a bed Nothing was onnothing was happening Its all in your imagination  Well a littlebehind the scenes here you might rememberthat there was a second conditionto that experiment where we implantednumbers in peoples heads So once we get them to believe that the machinereads their mind So their minds are blown And then we insertednumbers in their head So one of the guys youmight remember say I thought of the number45 I hate the number 45 I would never myselfpick that number the number was justflying into my face And so its in thatsecond condition that a lot of them reported kind of weird feelings liketingling and headaches  Thats rightI totally forgot It didnt even makeit into the episode But we also said now thatwe can read your mind we are going to implantthoughts into your mind you are going to have anumber put into your head youll close your eyes and a number will appearthat we have put there And of course we use thesame sleight of hand trick to convince them thatthats what happened whatever they thought they had Whatever they had thought waswhat we wanted them to think And obviously thats crazy like that couldbe abused so much But yet we convincedneuro science postdocs that we were able to do it  And you might rememberwe were toying around with doing like justimprovising a third condition where we make peoplespeak or like say things or we induce thesymptoms of Tourettes And in retrospect if we haddone that saying the behavior in the reverse exorcismepisode remember like we were able to induceall kinds of weird feelings like even an outof body experience but we couldnt reallyget people to speak We couldnt get the spiritto speak through their mouth But if youd have taken them through like twosteps like this to really convince them that this machineis doing something then we could havegotten participants to do all kinds of wild things  Yeah that we branded at time but I remember thatday you were like lets just go out on the streetrecruit people to come in I can get them to say bad words And think that its being like theyre a puppetof the machine  Is that related to hypnosis  Yeah sure absolutely It is hypnosis its accessoryritual assisted hypnosis  I think thathypnotism is often seen well at least Ican speak for myself as a nothing but a trick right I know that there are caseswhere its used clinically Is it all placebo though I mean what areyou really doing when you hypnotize someone And they need to besusceptible to it  Have you ever been hypnotized  No I think I could respondto being hypnotized like this Because while I donthave a lot of faith in whoa Hocus Pocus hypnotizy instead I will belike this is an MRI youre wearing a lab coat whatever is gonnahappen is gonna happen  Yeah so ishypnosis like placebo that depends whatyou mean by placebo But if what youreasking is is hypnosis tapping into some sayautonomic resources that we typically dont have access tovolitionally effortfully then yes So getting people to somehowrelax their hyper vigilance and being being able to tap into or elicitsphysiological responses that they themselves couldnot induce voluntarily Yes And I think youre correct The induction ritual of surrendering tothe set of suggestions about falling into trance thats the kind of acultural bound ritual that works for some peoplethat may not work for others But I think that anyonecan be hypnotized as long as youfind the right set of what we wouldcall epistemic cues So you tap into thekind of knowledge the kinds of things thattheyre likely to believe in as being authoritative thenyou can definitely get people to relax theircritical thinking  So Ill say Ive actuallybeen hypnotized before And I was very veryskeptical going in And as the hypnotistwas telling me oh when you open your eyes youre gonna forgetthe number three I remember thinkingto myself consciously theres no way Imgonna fall for this And then he sayOkay now count to 10 And then I would get tothree and then I would pause even though Im tellingmyself in my head Im saying I can see the number threebut I just couldnt get it out  Wow I need to do thisI need to get hypnotized because Ive always seenit as just a party trick where Im gonna make youbark like a dog on stage for at a kids birthday party And they do and Im liketheyre all faking it  But you may notbe susceptible So theres a pretty Gaussiandistribution of susceptibility So most people will fall forsome things but not all Some people willfall for nothing  Some fall for all Exactly  So its interestingbecause it is a relatively stable psychological tradeand thats well studied It doesnt change muchthroughout the lifetime except in childhood So between the agesof seven and 14 is when people aremore hypnotizable And some people are so wesay their highs or lows high hypnotizableslow hypnotizables and there is anormal distribution  But its really weird Actually I dont knowif Id recommend it It was a kind of an unpleasantexperience to be hypnotized  Ive done moreunpleasant things I think I wanna talk aboutthat after this episode kind of talk through someof the more uncomfortable and scary moments but for now lets just get rightback into the episode All right here we go soft music Theres evidence thatthe power of suggestion even works on animals A study at NorthCarolina State University found that 86 of dogs receivingreal seizure medication had a reduction in seizures but almost as many a full 79 experienced the same effectfrom just a placebo pill Now we dont know how aplacebo effects a dogs brain But it could be thatdogs have learned to associate vet visitsand medicine from humans with feeling better So giving them a placebo could help a dogsbrain heal itself upbeat music Quick note we recorded the scene withthat dog so many times There were so many takeswere you there Dan  I was there  Oh man first of all I dont think a lot ofpeople dont know this But all those rooftop scenes from season one andtwo were shot at night We did a whole weekof overnight shoots from 500 in the eveningto 500 in the morning And so I dont know whattime of night that was But were all exhausted Its like 300 in the morning the dogwould climb up to you  The dog would jump on me yeah it was hard to getthe dog to wait And the trainer was like look the dog doesntunderstand its cue It just knows that youregonna give him cheese It doesnt knowwhat youre saying And he doesnt knowwhen its a good moment The dog was not a great actor Shall we continue Here we go  So first Ill askyou to lay down again And of course yourea total pro at this  Michael For several weeks the children had undergonesessions in the Sham scanner at McGill University  Your body continues to relax as we keep unleashingthis healing energy  Michael Each timethey were reminded that through concentrationand relaxation they were helpingheal their own brains  There we go Finally after six weeks ofreceiving the placebo sessions it was time to get areport on the results Malaya suffered from anxiety and a compulsive skinpicking disorder Had she experiencedany level of success Its good to see you Good to see you  Go ahead and take aseat youre wearing not even I thought maybetheyd have short sleeves on youve just got a tank top on Your arms look fantastic Theyve really gotten better And your face I mean all of it Why do you think youre better  Im guessing its the machine  Michael Yeah what about it  Ah Im not reallysure how it works But Im picking a lot less sometimes if I seelike a tiny flake Ill just leave it there  Thats a pretty short amountof time for such a big change in the way you think andbehave thats awesome  I dont really feelthe urge to do it as much as I did before soits a big improvement I guess  Yeah thatdefinitely feels like and sounds like yourbrain being powerful  Its obviouslydoing something because my arms are better  Well you seem alot more confident holding your head up higherwould you agree Anne Marie  Yes she seems less anxious Shes more positive mumblesI was hoping for this Its more than nice to see her  Yeah good work And ask for Nicholas andhis migraine headaches Hey its good to seeyou again Nicholas Tell me about the procedureand how you felt afterwards  It accomplished thingsthat I wanted it to I havent had a migraine at all  Michael Thats awesome  And concentration is abig thing that it helped  Wow And can I see thesymptom charts  For sure  So these go back to February  Yeah and theyrereally telling  And you can see notgood lots going on But then recentlyno migraines at all Thats incredible  Yeah  So you said you wentto the neurologist  They thought itwas quite remarkable He hasnt needed anyrescue medication and he hasnt neededthe preventer And hes not having migraines  Im actually reallyexcited for high school  Michael BothMalaya and Nicholas attribute their improvementsto the Sham scanner They believed it was workingfor them and indeed it did So how did Nathan whosuffered from ADHD and impulse control disorderfair over the last six weeks Well I received a homevideo from Nathans mother with an update on his progress  So the best part aboutgoing through the treatment was just what it did to ourson we noticed a difference in Nathan immediatelyafter the first session and do you rememberwhat happened  I slept  Yeah he sleptsomething he doesnt do very often during the dayhe slept for two hours He was refreshed it wasjust incredible to see it And then what happenedwas the entire summer we had him off themedicine and he did great He thought about stuffbefore he did it we were able to talk thingsout and its been fun So overall were very pleased And we just had sucha great experience so thank you very much  Michael The Childrensresults are encouraging and a powerful sign ofhow effective suggestions and our willingnessbelieve them can be In time the kidswill understand how all of the powerwas within them and not in the scanner This work is truly cutting edgeit hasnt been done before  Correct We also think of thisas a great new way to do science andto collaborate  So much more of the publicwill see whats being done  Yes science isntjust about publishing a paper that nobody reads Its about spreadingthe ideas that you find  100  As far as Im concernedyoure already a co author in our scientificexperimental paper  Wow very cool Thank you upbeat music  Michael TheChildrens improvements were caused by theplacebo effect And no deception wasused to mask that The parents knew themachine was deactivated And the children were onlytold that it had the power to put a suggestionin their brain a suggestion that ultimatelycame from themselves But surely the morepeople learn about placebos and their lack ofintrinsic power the less effectivetheyll be right No studies show thateven when subjects learned that their treatmentwas a placebo the positive resultsdo not go away What the subjects have learnedabout how to heal themselves remains with them It was an honor to havebeen a part of this study I think this is MindField at its best Using our resources to helpresearchers with their work and helping the public seehow the brain is studied Placebos cant fix everything But these kids always hadthe power to start healing All they needed was thepower of suggestion And as alwaysthanks for watching All right sothats the episode Dr Veissière I havedismissed Elisabeth and Daniel so that we can talkone on one honestly  I miss them  Do you feel the pressure What are your thoughts nowtwo years after that episode  Well my thoughts are weare to take this further And so Im thinkinglots of directions One of them is practical Its kind of unfortunatethat the general public is really interested in this But its still hard to convince the scientific communityand the clinical community theres somethingworth pursuing there because its so weird So its been difficultto get research funding its been difficult to getour research papers accepted for publication whenwe try to present this particular project  How do you do acontrol in a study on the effectiveness of placebo Like do you test itagainst a different placebo  Yeah and thats been oneof the comments from reviewers when we try to submitthis from publications And I think it was areally good comment theyre asking okay so it seems youredoing this really cool really amazing procedure youre giving thesekids a lot of attention a lot of positive reinforcement But what exactly works And what doesnt work Is there anythingin that intervention that is absolutelynecessary or essential For example do youactually need the scanner Could you just go and give kids lots of positive suggestionsabout how they can use their hyperactivity to bereally focused and strong Or could you do us just a watch so I can tell you somethingwere doing right now is were beginning to testin a randomized trial just the watch versusjust the machine to see if one ofthem works better  Huh okay that soundsreally nice and precise  Precise or not Because even then theresso many other factors as you know sosay the charisma or the reassuring toneof the experimenter Like Im sure youre interested in the replicationcrisis in psychology So one of the hypothesesis also that well it could be that some labs aretrying to replicate a study Well the experimenters arejust not as charismatic theres just not as goodor not as authoritative And theres lots of otherfactors that are going on And its not just a mechanismitself that doesnt work is that this one team isnot able to reproduce it  Man its so hard to controlfor all of those things a bunch of differentpeople need to run this but they all have to havethe exact same charisma And every day no matterwhat their mood is different from dayto day it cant be Because we really only wannalook at watch versus machine when we know that the charismacan play such a big role  Mm hmm or also thesetting of the study is it in the hospital Or is it like right now were gonna replicateit in a school Because it turned outthat logistically now that Mind Field is not there to handle recruitment for usthen we just could not manage to bring all theparticipants in the hospital And we have a contingentfrom the school So its a lot easierto do it there And as such we also have touse a simpler mock scanner  Right you know whatthat brings brings up a big limitation of howMind Field can help Because if you said okay Ive got a differentexperimental design that I think is gonnawork really well But its very similar Could you do another episode that will look almostexactly the same I would love to but I dont know ifYouTube would pay for that So I hope that Mind Field can at least bringwhats being done and its importanceto the public so that they know what tosupport and they know what to I dont know what kind ofgood things are being done and why its important for usto have research institutions that are investigating thingsthat might seem I dont know a little still fuzzy but yet can lead toamazing discoveries What are you working onthat I dont know about that might be interesting for future episodes ofMind Field of Vsauce I know that you wereworking with tulpamancers Thats still going on And if so explain what that is  Sure so before talkingabout tulpamancers were also doinglots of stuff related to suggestion andplacebo studies So were testing like say fakeAdderall fake psychedelics  Michael Fake psychedelics  Fake psychedelics  Theres an episode in thefirst season of Mind Field where we give people a shortacting and psychedelic and we haveConfederates in the room that pretend like Whoa Everythings echoing And sure enough you can makepeople think theyre tripping  Absolutely and wealso use Confederates just like you guys and wehad really good results  So what are youspecifically like what variables are you kindof tweaking and studying  Well were also interestedin the whole battery of non specificpsychosocial effects beyond the chemical propertiesof the substance themselves including the particularcultural expectations that this psychedelic experience should yield thisparticular effect So were looking at socialproof social conformity emotional contagion but also testing particularcultural beliefs Were also going to betesting Sham genetic testing to see how convincing thatmight be and at some point one of your dream is to comparethat to Sham neuroscience so to see different kindsof neuro enchantment  Whats the point Okay so we learn thatpeople are neural enchanted and theyre I dontknow DNA enchanted whats the word for that ourfaith and genetic research  We think theyre reallybig ethical implications particularly when we startthinking about potential nocebo effects and culturallywidespread nocebo effects So genetic testing alsogenerates a lot of anxiety A lot of the times its not done under proper clinical settingsand clinical guidance and people startworrying immensely because they havea particular gene that is thought to correlate with a particularcondition like say Alzheimers for example And that can bring about allkinds of negative experiences including sometimes perhapsprecipitating early onset of diseases that may nototherwise have been triggered So we think theres lotsof important implications particularly interms of debunking dangerous pseudo medicaland pseudo scientific idea So if were able to demonstrate that theres a lot of authority a lot of placebo noceboeffects associated with say genetic testingthen were better able to inform clinical practicefor example or policy  And the public cannot bequite so enchanted by it or perhaps misledneedlessly panicked Wow its important stuff  And so to answeryour questions yes were still workingwith tulpamancers As you recall I did acyber ethnography years ago with just delivered apsychological testing on these really coolweird young people who conjure imaginary friends that they come toexperience as basically as auditory visualhallucinations excepttheyre not crazy And they report an increasein well being in their life even in socialadjustment as a result of having pickedup the practice So people wanna saywell theyre crazy theyre hearing voices and wethink were able to show that No in fact thereslots of context in which you can hear voicesand be a very healthy person So now under the leadershipof Dr Mike Lifshitz and Dr Tanya Lermanat Stanford University were in the processof doing neuro imaging of tulpamancers andcomparing them also to evangelical Christianswho speak in tongues And so were interested inseeing what happens in the brain when either spirit or tulpa sort of takes overand starts talking And were interested in the motor areas ofthe brain as well And we wanna see if somethingdifferent is going on When say an agency other thanitself a tulpa or a spirit is sort of in control  Yeah what does itlook like in the brain when you arent in control ofyour thoughts and behavior If we can teaseout the difference then are we literally findinglike that is your agency that is yourconsciousness your will And if its gone then youfeel like youre possessed Which by the way brings us to our reverse exorcism episode which you guysshould all check out Keep me up to dateon what youre doing because I really wannahelp in any way that I can And communicate all thecool work that youre doing So Dr Veissière thanks Its always a pleasure  Always a pleasure Thanks for having me  Now were gonnaturn to a darker topic My own death Should I die Lets find out eerie music Someday I will die But should I If I was offered a longer life I would take that in a second But how long is too long Is death something Ishould deny forever Or is death and the roleit plays in the universe something I ambetter off accepting upbeat music I wanna start by lookingat a particular way death affects how we liveand treat one another Terror Management Theoryproposes that people like you and me manage theterror of deaths inevitability by embracing cultural values That the more aware a personis of their own mortality the more vehemently they willenforce their particular views of the world on to others Created by socialpsychologists Sheldon Solomon Jeff Greenbergand Tom Pyszczynski Terror Management Theory or TMT suggests that oftenwe are afraid of change because were afraid of death Each one of us has aworldview a set of beliefs customs and norms we identifywith that can live on after our businessphysical bodies die TMT suggests that rises innationalism and prejudice are correlated with rises inthe salience of mortality but is how present theinevitability of death is in peoples minds This role that deathplays fascinates me and two have TMToriginators Jeff and Sheldon have agreed to workwith me on a pilot study of Terror Management Theory and real lifereminders of death soft music Whats your hypothesis today Well I think were gonnahope for the participants who are reminded of theirmortality to be more punitive and their assessments  Lets see what happens  Good morning  Michael For our study wecreated a fake Research Center staffed by actors andinvited participants to be a part of what theywere told was a focus group about the criminaljustice system During the actual studyeach group will hear a list of several differentcrimes that have been committed and will then be askedto propose a punishment for each offenderwith a severity level ranging from one to seven withone being the most lenient and seven being the most severe The control group willsimply enter the survey room and be asked toanswer the questions The experimental grouphowever will first be exposed to reminders oftheir own mortality with strategically placedposters in the lobby Also the questionnairesthey fill out will include questionsabout their own death Decades of TMT research haveshown that when presented with violations ofcommon worldviews those who are more awareof their own deaths will recommend biggerpunishments for thecrimes presented But will our real lifereminders of death not just the surveyquestions usually used make a difference Well first lets look atthe control participants  Thank you so muchfor being here Now I cannotemphasize this enough there are no rightor wrong answers This is just about yourgut level reactions All right lets begin After raisingmillions of dollars in grant money to fundeducation for needy children a fundraising managerunhappy with this life fled with all the money and was arrested monthslater in Tasmania where he was livingunder a different name So one his punishmentthree months in prison seven is most severe10 years in prison Please answer now upbeat music  This is one that I thinkdoes has views on both sides  Yeah bell ringing  Michael Thatis a lot of sevens If our control group isalready maxing out like that well then our scale hasno room in that direction to show any effectivemortality salience Discovering issues like this learning how to better isolatemortality salients effect is exactly what apilot test is for Hey Hey  Personal differences huh  Yeah  An imposter with no medicaltraining posed as a surgeon and bungled a minor operationto remove a childs tonsils The patient recovered fullyafter additional treatment One is six months on probationseven is 10 years in prison upbeat music  Okay if you are takingon the persona of a doctor we expect good behavior bell ringing  The surgeonbotched the operation and was found to be underthe influence of narcotics causing her to havepermanent hoarseness and ruining her career bell ringing upbeat music A 16 year old girl who hadjust received her license drove through a redlight hitting another car that was being drivenby a talented pianist bell ringing upbeat music A couple was taking their twochildren to the playground when they saw a womansunbathing nude  Look at that there could be a gender gap Were also learning a lot aboutthe world views people have  Jeff Yeah absolutely bell ringing upbeat music  An anti governmentprotester was arrested for spring painting profanitiesat the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC One 40 hours  Wow she went one right away  Five years in prison Shes not a fan of authority and rules Yeah bell ringing upbeat music  Okay thank you somuch for your time I really appreciate it  All right soheres the results and the mathematical analysis These are averages per question These are the averages andmedians per participant  The fours are greatthe three is great  But this is groundsfor optimism at least  Seven was the maxsentencing value and our control groupgave an average of 45 Im really happy withthat as a control group  Absolutely  Michael Now ourexperimental groups Remember they willbe seeing posters that remind them oftheir own mortality and will be asked differentquestions in their questionnaire for example pleasedescribe the emotions that the thought of yourown death arouses in you And write down asspecifically as you can what you think will happento you physically as you die The point is to primetheir mortality salience Lets see if this group is more punitive towardsworldview violations  After raising millions ofdollars to fund education for needy childrena fundraising manager fled with all the money and was arrested monthslater in Tasmania One three months in prison seven 10 years inprison please answer now upbeat music  Hes thinking about it  Please hold up your answers All right thank you so much  Ah okay bell ringing upbeat music  An imposter with no medicaltraining posed as a surgeon and bungled a minor operationto remove a childs tonsils One six months on probationseven 10 years in prison upbeat music  They are thinking a lot more  Yeah upbeat music laughing  A 10 Im pretty sure sheknows that seven is the highest  Well call it a seven yeah  Its funny to see whenpeople feel bold enough even though Im likebreaking the bounds and the rules of the task bell ringing upbeat music  An anti governmentprotester was arrested for painting profanities at the Lincoln Memorialin Washington DC upbeat music  I really do appreciatethe way they clearly seem to be taking a bitmore time to deliberate  Yeah upbeat music bell ringing upbeat music  Okay they canput the papers down and tell them that wewill be in shortly  Okay thank you so much We finished with thispart of the study So if you dont mind justhanging out for a moment And our researchers willbe in here in a moment to ask you a couple questions  Lets find out if thereminders of mortality we showed our experimentalgroup were salient enough  Let me ask youabout one thing out in the waiting room did you all noticethe posters at all  All Yes  Okay  I was surprised as soonas they walked in the door and I saw the gravestones  Yeah thats right  I wondered whatdid I get into  So we are lookinginto something thats called TerrorManagement Theory And its the idea that yourown awareness of your mortality can affect the behaviorsthat you exhibit that we all manage theterror that we feel knowing that we are mortalby behaving in certain ways especially in ways thatreinforce our own worldviews because we can kind of liveon through the societies and cultures and identitiesthat we have today  Did any of you feel likeyou were still thinking a little bit about death when you were came in here  I was definitelygoing after people who transgressed against myworldview to use your terms Yes I noticed that Yes I was definitelydoing that  So this wasincredibly helpful Thank you very muchfor your participation It looks like our experimentalstimuli were successful They were salient but theydidnt cause the participants to think they wererelated to the study  The control participantsaveraged about 45 The experimental participantswere close to 47 So theres a slight tendencyfor the experimental people to be leaning in thedirection that we predicted But were talkingabout relatively inconsequential differences  Thats right It just makes me hungryto run more people And with the number that we had Thats statisticallyinsignificant Do you think that wedid see any effects of mortality salience today  I feel like themortality salient groups tended to take a littlelonger before responding  Yeah me too  And they seem more thoughtful they really put moreeffort into trying to do the right thing  The differencewas dramatic enough that we picked up on it  Absolutely  Michael Although ourstimuli might need to go through a couple more passesand some more vetting we did find an interestingdifference in the time it took for ourgroups to respond Our control group took anaverage of four minutes and 46 seconds to decideon their punishments But our experimentalgroup took an average of seven minutes 18 seconds  In a sense that reallyis the prediction the right thing bytheir own worldview But by the same tokenwhen we think about death we wanna do whats right And if were acting like jurors we wanna make theright decisions  As we very much learned today the goal isnt to prove onething one way or the other Its just to reduce uncertainty In the most carefulway possible  Absolutely To know a little bit moretoday than we did yesterday  Whoa okay we havea lot to talk about And luckily Ive got justthe person here with me to talk about allof this with Judy Ho a clinical neuropsychologist tenured professor at Pepperdineyou run your own practice you work with ethics a lot What is your actual position  So Im the chair of theinstitutional review board at Pepperdine University which is how we firststarted working together because you were doingthe trolley experiment And that was an interestingthing to talk about  Yes if you have seenthe trolley problem episode of Mind Field youhave seen Judy there helping us with the ethics of can we make people thinktheyve committed murder Is that okay Maybe its not okay forthe university to do but can a TV show do it Bottom line is we learned a lot And so Judy I wanted youhere today to talk with me about running experimentson people okay But also running experimentson people for a TV show Because there are allkinds of limitations and issues that come up And I think that what wejust saw is a great example of all the differentthings that happen that are both good and bad challenges andopportunities for Mind Field when it comes topsychological experiments  Sure  So the biggestproblem we have is its not possible for us to run enormous numbersof participants We have a very tight schedule and we have a wholecrew working with us we cannot run hundredsor thousands of people we can run like a couple dozen And sometimes thatsnot enough to really get a statisticallysignificant result  Right  Also I think itsvery clear here The kinds of participantswho come on to the show they dont even knowtheyre on a TV show by the way until the endwhen we debrief them but the kinds of people whoare available here in LA in the middle of the day  Right  Is a both a very narrow and a very wide group of people  Right  If we were runningthis at a University and we needed people to befree in the middle of the day we would get a veryhomogenous group  Yeah  They would bepredominantly young people between like 19 and 22 their worldviews wouldbe pretty similar I mean theyre all atthe same institution theyre probably socioeconomically pretty well off because theyre atthis university Their cultural backgroundsmight be much more similar than what we find working in TV where we might get retiredpeople and immigrants and really young people andactors a lot of actors  Right yes  Oh my gosh thenumber of people in LA who were free to do studiesin the middle of the day who part time actors is a huge which that always leads to theissue of the audience at home goes wait a second andthey Google up something and they go that personwas on a TV show right Is this all just fake And its likethats what its like to just grab whosavailable in LA But because of thediversity that we get I think our populationsrepresent the country better But also we haveway more noise  Yes  Questions about howbad is it to deface an American monumentare going to have very different answersfrom different people  Absolutely  And in this particularstudy we had that problem Were trying to see if youllenforce your worldview more or less if youre reminded that youre goingto die someday and the issue was thateveryone showing up had very different worldviews  Yes All right so Ive just thrown a whole bunch of stuff at you  A lot of stuff to talk about Well first of all Ithought it was fascinating the way that it was set up And it was a really reallygood episode to watch And just to see thereactions of the proponents of the theory that was so cool that you got them to be in it Cause they areinvested in the theory  That was so cool And both of them wroteall of those scenarios And it was trulyscience in action They came up with scenarios we found out Wow some ofthese are just so extreme even to a control groupthat we dont see any room for any other variables tochange in that direction So we had to rewritethem in between days and gosh it was true science  Yeah no it was reallycool to see it in action And it was really coolto see how different the control group and theexperimental group was in terms of the latency andeven their facial responses as they wereconsidering all of this I certainly saw thatbeing a significant effect that they just seemedlike they were taking their roles so muchmore seriously right Whereas sometimes whenyou get these people to come in for anexperimental study theyre just herefor their whatever 10 or whatever youreoffering them for their time And theyre morehaphazard about it And I certainly saw thatwith a second group there was just this realpronounced sense of gravity to their considerations  Yeah we thought what the severity of punishmentdealt out that will be the variable that will changebased on mortality sale But it turned out to bedisposition and thoughtfulness  Totally  Luckily we recordedthe whole thing So we could go back andsay how long did they take That wasnt originally measured but because of thefootage we could time And we found out that ittook almost twice as long for the group thatcame in thinking Ive just written an essay about what I thinkdeath will be like Punishing people forviolating cultural norms This is a heavy thing tooand they reacted differently  Yeah and I thinkthat it may not be I mean I understandthe original tenants of Terror Management Theory But I can also imaginewhen somebody is really really very cognizantof their mortality that they might actuallybe more lenient like life is shortI want this person to have a second chance And so I think part ofwhat wasnt measured that might have been helpful is actually trying tocounterbalance the two groups in terms of do you have thesame types of belief systems and ideologies right Because if we dont have that then theyre kind of justgoing at their own values And if we dont knowvery much about it you can see why thatnoise could contribute to the average being 45and 47 in the two groups  Exactly which is basicallyno difference at all right  Right yeah  But yes I think inhindsight and this is again the whole point ofscience is to be like all right what can we learn And how can we keep at all times the uncertainty on thistrack down and down And right if we kind of knew what peoples worldviewswere ahead of time like if we had interviewedthem a couple of weeks before long enough ago that they dontremember it anymore right Make them somehow notthink that it matters too much that thequestions are related then the test I think couldhave given us better results in terms of the punishmentsdealt out and all of that And it can be frustratingwhen you wanna do a show and you wanna showresults and teach but you also want to experiment And sometimes the experimentwont always leave you with everything nicely tied up  Right  And thats a goodlesson to give people but it has been frustratingto do experiments where you need a bigpopulation of people its easier on the Mind Field to make myself the guinea pig Or focus on a topic where we just need to seeit happen one time  Right right  Like can I get someone tofalsely confessed to a crime If I get one person todo it then were done But if I wanna see atendency for people to be more punitiveto worldview their worldview violationsif theyre reminded of death I really need to runhundreds of people So I mean what doyou what do you think Do we need to remind theaudience of that every time  Honestly I dont think so And I would say first of all that socialpsychology experiencesmumbles especially are built on the backbone of very homogenous populations its tended to always involveundergraduate students who are given theoption of either doing this 10 minute experimentor writing a 15 page paper Its not really veryethical actually Because youre kind of coercingthem towards the experiment And so youre gonnaget lots of first and second yearpsychology students And again itsstill for a class So how honest arethey really being Because what if theprofessor discovers what their answers are And so theres allkinds of things that are alreadyinherently an issue and even the publishedstudies and social psychology And I think what a TVexperiment really does that I dont thinkany more kind of planned out researchstudy with hundreds and thousands ofparticipants will do is a really lively andvisual demonstration And that in itselfis really useful Because if somebodyactually says Now I wanna takethat study protocol and apply it to 500 people they now have atemplate to do that  Which they shoulddo by the way please do that that would be Mind Field wouldhave done its job But yeah I thinkthe responsibility I have with Mind Field is todocument how science is done and what results might look like and what the protocols can be And then the comments might have been full ofpeople with different ideas how it would havebeen a differentlyand Im like perfect  Awesome that people wannaweigh in and be so engaged  Exactly go off and do that we really didnt know howthat experiment would go And I still dontknow how it would go if you change one littlething in one way or the other  Well and Ithink it also shows the beauty of what anad hoc analysis can do Like oftentimes youhave your hypotheses like for exampleyour hypothesis wasthat you would go in and you would see that therewas gonna be more severity in terms of ratingsof punishment in theexperimental group But actually youdidnt see that And then you thought thatsomething else was happening because we saw the videotape And oh its howlong they took And you were able to goback and call that data and to make astatement about that And that differencewas significant It was almost doubledthe amount of time that the experimental groupit was cool to see that  It was cool And you could feel adifference in the mood which its hard to measure But you know whatwhen you are recording everything from multipleangles you have that evidence right you havethat documentation  They seem stressed Like when I was watchingthem I felt bad for them They they just looked so upset  They werent fun scenario its like hey thisperson botched a surgery because they lied abouttheir qualifications Or this doctor gotdrunk and hurt someone There are pretty bad thingsto think about anyway  This really just brings upthough kind of the spirit of why we do experimentsin the first place because its always acost benefit analysis And I think we talked about this also on the trolley episode Its really about what kindof information youre getting Are you just torturingpeople for fun and using your hiddencameras for fun Or are you providing some kindof educational value or a way that people can processimportant issues like mortality When I first sawyou in the casket I gotta tell you thatsone of my worst fears We talked about this on themost recent episode I worked on with you that that is mybiggest fear is death So that you are providingsome value and insight to people who are thinkingabout how do I make the most of my time on this earth And does it mean if Itake my moral decisions a little bit more carefully that Im gonna feel betterabout myself in my life at the end of the day Because that could beproviding some kind of insight for people tobetter their lives  Yeah thats my favorite partof every experiment we run the debriefingwhere I get to say heres what were studying And people theyve never gone Okay cool can Iget my money now Theyre always likewell they want the money But also of coursetheyre like wow oh yeah cause I was feeling thisand theyre excited to think about it onthe on the car home and theyre gonna tell theirfriends about it that night And I hope it does alot of good for them even if sometimes they may have been a littlebit scared halfway through  Yeah yeah exactly And I think that thatis really the core of why the experimentsare important on TV because you are gonna geta more engaged audience And if it encourages peopleto think about themselves and to encouragepersonal developmentto tell their friends and family then I thinkyouve done a great job So I dont think that youhave to necessarily say and by the way maybethis experiment will turn out different ifyou had 500 people running it because the visualaspects of the experiment as it is built is whatstriggering these people to really do thatself evaluation versus reading it on a page I mean thats part of theproblem with experiments is that theyre in thesejournals that you have to be a psychologist to subscribe or just a really interestedperson whos not a psychologist that you wanna payyour 500 a year  Because youre getting likea weekly thing and its huge Oh my gosh  No ones gonna read that So this is a great way forpeople to understand experiments and not feel afraid a lotof people will tell me Im afraid to run experiments That seems like alot of work to do Well the way that it wasbroken down in the episode it doesnt reallylook like people cant do a version ofit themselves sometimes  It did take a lot of work We have the best crew ever You made it look easy  Yeah we made it lookeasy love to hear that I also think what wejust saw is a good way to talk abouthidden camera shows  Yeah Because a commonquestion I get is how do the people notknow theyre on TV How do they not see the cameras And they dont wedo a really good job I mean were in LA and Im working with thebest hidden camera people I mean I go into theroom and Im like but arent we gonna film this And theyre like werefilming it right now  From five cameras  Yeah the ways theyhave the disguise cameras Ive always said we needto cover that on the show So that people know how wellhidden the cameras were  Yeah cause they wereexcellent angles too you got really good I know but guess what the producers are like no because then peoplewill know the secrets and theyll knowwhat to look at Trade secrets but also they dont want futureparticipants to go You know what If I see that pattern theres probably acamera behind it It works becausepeople dont know how were hiding them so well If you look at theprojectors screen you can see thattheres a band across it of a different texture And that is something thata camera can see through But in the room you dontthink anything of it Its just this boringfeature and no one notices And then when we tellthem theyre on TV theyre all like what So theres a wholeother permission formthey have to sign after they learn that cause we cant tellthem beforehand or else people will actdifferent if they know that theres goingto be an audience out there watching later  Yes absolutely And we see that a lot insocial psychology studies I mean even just the presenceof more people in the room can already impacthow they respond So in this particular scenariothere was one experimenter it feels less like an audience But sometimes youll havethree or four experimenters and it does like really like in a big way affecthow people start to deal with themselvesdeal with each other you can sometimes seethem being more polite a little bit moreginger with things And its only because theythink that other people are watching and takingnotes about them  You know what It makes me wanna bringup something else we really need to getback into the episode but like come on I cando whatever I want right So Mind Field began as this idea I had for a show that at the time Icalled Prankology because when I was astudent in high school and collegepsychology professors would often showCandid Camera clips and then talk aboutthe social psychology that was evident in those clips The clips were entertainingthe science was cool Im like lets do that and pranks were kind of athing because of Punked This was a while back right But all of the pranks thatlike networks wanted to do essentially only taughtone thing fight or flight They just wanted peopleto get really scared and freaked out andpee in their pants Luckily YouTube sawthat there was value in something like this Were like so isanyone gonna scream Is anyone gonna thinktheir car was totaled And Im like no theyrejust gonna respond to a question with a number Interestingly you haveto make that interesting How do you have someonefill out a survey and have it be good visually Well we came up with theidea of having them write their number and then show itto the proctor of the study so that the camera couldsee what number they wrote Thats the whole reasonthey did it that way rather than fill itin and turn the paper  Which of coursechanges results too Because if its aprivate opinion versus one that theyreshowing their showing somebody  Theyre showing then theirface is associated with it But last at the last minute we had to put those blinders up So they couldnt seewhat other people next to them were doing Because we knew thatthat would affect it So we had to walkthe line of okay we want them toput the number up next to their facefor the camera but we dont want that to affect how they answer the question So how do we make surethat it still feels as private as possible  Right  A lot of thinkinggoes in this  A lot of thinkinga lot of thinking And I also wonder to justeven the characteristics of the experimenter in the room the actor that you guys hired Again with certainof those questions there could also be a response of well this person mightjudge me if I rate this a seven just based on theirown perception of what that personmight be thinking  Exactly that is somethingthat is worth investigating more experimenting with more What I can say is thatduring those trials the direction we gave Trinwhos our wonderful actress shes just perfect at thiskind of role and many others but we told her you haveto kind of act bored Like youve beendoing this all day and you dont carewhat they write down  Yeah no gasps of surprise  Yeah youre not gonna belike oh you gave it a one Also she just read a scriptshe read each word off a page So it was alwaysthe same language And it was just monotone whichis a funny direction to give someone who is in a likea really talented actress To be like we need you to As boring as possible  Be as boring as possible And its the leastacting as possible  Right right  As a littleacting as possible Judy thank you so much Thank you so fun  Always a pleasure Awesome  All right were gonnacontinue watching this episode when we come back Iwill have a new guest but not new to you or me So actually not anew guests at all but Ill have a different guest Lets get ready to learn more about whetherMichael should die upbeat music Our pilot test shows thattheres still a lot to discover about terror management andmany promising ways to do it Im particularly intriguedby our observation that for all theclosed mindedness mortality salience appearsto cause it also led to what looked like increasedconsideration and thought Id love to see moreresearch on that idea But the point is this If deaths effectsarent all entirely bad what if instead of orat least at the same time that we hope for theabolition of natural death we also find a way to accept it Now obviously I dont wantto die at least not soon But accepting theinevitability of my own death and being less afraid of itfeels powerful and honest Id like to learnwhat that looks like And I have a friendwho can help soft music Im paying a visit toCaitlin Doughty a mortician author and deathpositivity activist who has made an entirecareer out of discussing the aspects of death thatmost of us prefer to ignore What do you say tosomeone who comes to you and says I thinkdeath is terrifying Its so scary and sad that Im just here now  Is this person dying Or is this person  This person is me infront of you right now  This person isyou okay so laughs I would tell youa couple things First youre dealing with the primal existentialquandary of human existence  Yes  And you are one of the many billions ofpeople who have felt this so youre not alonein feeling this way So we go through lifewe reach a certain age and we begin tounderstand that someday ourselves and everyonewe love will die And thats powerfulpainful knowledge And I think from that moment we have to start developing defense mechanismsto handle that and to integratethat into our lives  So what are thosedefense mechanisms  I think that the more obviousones would be having a child writing a bookmaking a TV show creating a legacy of some kind but theres also a moreinsidious version which is war taking othercountries being rich and being okay withother people being poor I think those are allsigns of death denial theyre all saying but Im okay because I have this moneyor I have this power or I have these kind of darkimpulses that allow me to say at least I can outrundeath in that way And of course thats nottrue no one can outrun death But you can trick yourselfinto believing that  So how would you characterize the westernrelationship to death  Take America 150 years ago if you were myhusband and you died I would be entirelyin charge of you I would wash your bodyI would get the neighbor to make a wooden coffin for you we would put you in thecoffin and carry you on our shoulders to the grave which someone haddug themselves It would have been an entirelyself sufficient process But what happened aroundthe turn of the 20th century is really three bigthings in my mind One you had therise of hospitals so people were nolonger dying at home you had the riseof funeral homes which means that we arenow outsourcing our death Third one is slaughterhouses so all of a suddenall food production and the killing of animalsis also hidden as well And we live in oursuburban houses where all thosethings are outsourced And its just theselittle layers and layers and layers ofdenial around death  But what does itmean to accept death  I dont think that youever truly accept death But I believe that themovement toward accepting death involves reallytrue self awareness about where youre hidingyour fears of death Thats where real awarenessand acceptance can come from  For me the thing thatsjust such a bummer about death is that I just Im done I dont get to continuelearning things and seeing what happens and Im just not partof Earth anymore  Isnt death kind of whatgives you that passion when you think about it When you think about like Ilove learning I love ideas If you didnt have an endpoint Are you gonna come in heretoday with all these cameras and do the hugeamount of legwork that creating a show requires  No  No right Because youre like I dontknow maybe Ill do it 200 years from nowwhereas right now youre taking ininformation left and right because you wannaproduce content you wanna produceexciting things and share with other people  Because this is myone chance to do that  This is your one chancethe passion and the realness to life comes from it ending Thats the great giftthat death gives us  Whats an unhealthyrelationship to have to your own mortality  The pursuit of immortality and the pursuit ofI will stay alive until I can upload mybrain into the cloud That worries me theidea that everyone is just allowed to live forever from here on out is notenvironmentally sensible Its just not a sensibleposition to take upbeat music  Narrator We are seeingthe dawn of a new era of possibilitiesunfold on planet Earth What more amazing willbe like in say 80 100 or even 200 years from now Wouldnt you like thepossibility of finding out upbeat music  To understand why somepeople feel like death shouldnt be inevitableIve come to Alcor one of the worlds leadinglife extension facilities Linda  Hi how are you  Great to meet you  Nice to meet you toowelcome down Alcor  Thank you for having me here Im meeting Linda Chamberlain who co founded Alcornearly 46 years ago So this facility thatwe are in right now is where you both cryopreserve people and store them  Yes we have 160 patients  Wow  And we have 1190 something members it changes  A member is someonewho is alive today  Alive today theyve madethe arrangements for this Once they are cryo preservedthey become patients  Youre using the word patient  Yes  Okay tell me aboutwhy you use that word  For us death is not something which is like an on off switch One second youre alivethe next second youre dead What we are tryingto do is to slow down and stop the dying process  To become a patient at Alcor First you have to paybetween 80 and 200000 then you have to dieor more specifically be pronounced clinically dead This generally meansthat your heart and lungs have stopped functioning At that point Alcorcan begin their work  Now there are twoways that a person could sign up forthis procedure Theres a whole bodypatient or as a neuro  Oh and does neurojust mean head  It means yes thecephalon actually which is all the structuresdown to about the clavicle Im a neuro everybodyin my family whos now in staces is a neuro Most of the peoplewho really understand the technology are neuros The primary reason thatpeople choose whole body is the emotional  Of course  And theyre not comfortablewith the idea of their body being removed and discarded So lets say that ourpatient is whole body the moment thepatient is pronounced they go into an ice bath And this is just crushed ice and its water in there as well Their heart is started againwith a mechanical thumper theyre intubated and theirlungs are functioning again being ventilated circulatingthe cooler temperature  Yeah yeah yeah So you need the veins thearteries the vasculature the heart you need all of those continuing to pumpand circulate  This is our operating room So basically when the patient comes inthrough the door there theyll go into this speciallydeveloped operating table it is going to be circulatingnitrogen gas over them to help cool them externally And if its whole body patient then the surgeons open the chest and then we begin circulating the organ transplants solution  Once in the operating room the patients blood is replaced with cooled organtransplant fluid and circulated throughthe vascular system to rapidly cooldown the internal and externaltemperatures of the body Now just before the waterwithin the body tissue reaches its freezing point Cryo protectivefluids are introduced These act like anti freezepreventing the formation of ice crystals thatcould damage soft tissue This is called thevitrification process  Now lets say thatit is a neuro patient So they come in first here  Yep their whole body  Right the surgeons will dothe neuro separation first  Okay yeah that makes sense  To separate the cephalon which is all of the structuresdown to about the clavicle bring it over here to this operating field Wash the blood outand we introduce the organ transplant solution  Im imagining apersons cephalon essentially their head in here I can see how itsgoing to get clamped in That looks like Im sure a crazy sci fi moviebut it really happens  It really happens  Michael Afterthe verificationprocess is complete The patients areplaced inside bags that are attachedto open metal cases which are then placedinside cylindrical tanks filled with liquidnitrogen called dewars  So this is ourpatient care bay We have 159 patients  In these tanks right here  In these tanks There are approximatelynine patients and each one of these fourwhole bodies and five neuros This one right here is where my husband is currently housed This one right here  Right this is whereFred is at the moment My mother and myfather in law are in this one  Wow its so weirdbecause I am right now not in a graveyard No Alcor is very muchlike an ambulance taking their loved ones to ahospital not down the street that a hospital in the future when technology can help them  Theyre not being transported through space but through time upbeat music To see what drives thistime traveling ambulance Im going to sitdown with Max More Alcors CEO and afuture neuro patient So Max whats the statusof the technology needed to revive cryopreserve specimens Are we getting closer  We are getting closer its gonna be decades atleast before we can bring back human beingswhole human beings But we already cryopreserved eggs sperm we cryo preserved skincorneas heart valves all kinds of things So these are single tissues andwe can reverse that process Now you move fromthat to an organ things get more difficult But we actually did anexperiment a few years ago took this little tiny wormwe used certain chemicals So it would learn that oh my foods over hereand not over here And we cryo preserved themand then we just waited brought them back andthen we tested them we were able to demonstrate that the memorytest that the ones that had received thetraining retained that memory So it was the firsttime in an organism weve provensurvive with memory So now were asking okaywhats the next step Because whole organisms aredifficult to reverse right now but step by step themore progress we can make the more convincing this is  Now when it comesto extending life some questions come uplike should people die I know we dont likethe idea of death but do we lose something  I know whatyoure getting at  By getting rid of death  Yeah I think wewill lose something like we lost somethingwhen we got rid of slavery orsmallpox So I think peoplepeople find themselves in knots to rationalize death I believe that Right now were kind ofin this tragic situation where over time hopefullyyou kind of learn your wisdom grows over time but the same time your cognitive and physical health isdeclining thats really sucks Thats a bad situation What if they both couldkeep going up indefinitely so you could livehundreds of years or longer and get smarter andmore knowledgeable and wiser and hopefully more matureand have more foresight because you got a muchlonger planning horizon What well have is a worldof like ultra mature people which I think willactually be a better world than the one we have today And if they say well and it just comes upall the time they say well death is whatgives life meaning Bullshit If that was true then wouldthey also advocate people who live to 90 shouldbe killed off at 45 will that double themeaning of their life In fact I think lifegets more meaning the longer you livebecause you can build on what youve done before So if anything it increases the meaningfulnessof life my view  Youre making merealize that in many ways I am rationalizing death Im looking for ways toexcuse it and accept it I dont think its unhealthyto accept that you are mortal  Well I have to accept it because I could getkilled at any time One thing Im have to stressbecause every article written they always have to use theword forever or immortality And thats not onthe table here Were just offering achance people to be revived in the time whenweve beaten aging But eventuallysomethings gonna get you so were notoffering immortality were offering an unknownextension of human lifespan upbeat music  Okay so Elisabethwelcome back  Thanks  Pretty heavy stuff You have a connection to Alcor In fact you were the onewho got us that interview  Yeah I set up the visit  So how did you comeinto contact with Alcor  Well I grew up in near SanFrancisco in the Bay Area So I think Alcor has alwaysbeen in my consciousness and my awarenesssince I was a kid I was familiar withthe philosophy of it And I probably have a dozenfriends or so who are members  I think you even are friends with the couple on thebrochure about Alcor  Thats right That people get  And Max is a friend as well  Right Yeah the CEO  So I guess the nextquestion is are you a member  Im not a member yet butI intend to be at some point  So whats keeping youfrom doing it the cost  Its just the cost right now Yeah thats it and alsothe fact that honestly if I were to die right now the chance ofbeing cryogenicallyfrozen is pretty low because the way I woulddie would probably be in a motorbike accident inIndia or something like that So itd be hard toget this cephalon back to the Alcor lab in time  Yep the best Its weird to talk aboutthis the best way to die to be cryogenicallyfrozen is to die right there near their facility I think theyve said thatthey have a lot of members who near the end of their lifemove to the Scottsdale area so that when they die they can be takenright away or actually an Alcor team canbe at your deathbed Now the best way to be frozen And this is kind ofwhat makes me feel like we have a long way to go is that the best wayfor me to be cryo frozen and then brought backlater is for someone to literally kill me right now Stick me in the ice bathright now start pumping in the fluid to cool my body downand kill me by cooling me If I die in any other way there will be toomuch cell death or at least there will be some because for a split second while the law decideswhether Im dead or not my cells are already dying  Right yeah And also I supposeby that logic you would also wanna do it as early in yourlife as possible when your brain is inthe best possible state  Exactly I wonder iftheyve ever had a member say all right I havecognitive decline And its happening tothe tissues in my brain If you preserve me when Ifinally am pronounced dead by an authority whatbrain will I have left Thats what Im stuck with They may believethat in the future we can just reconstructan entire consciousness by just knowing a little bit about some of the brainconnections and structures but I guess all ofthis brings us to what Caitlin was saying she really was uncomfortablewith that idea That it seems whatwere her words Non sensible  Well I think living forever immortality ispretty nonsensical And even Alcor willsay and even Max says that what theyre strivingfor is not immortality Its just extendingthe life that we have And theres many waysthat we do that already We have antibioticsand vaccinations andthings like that  Right just wearing a seatbelt is a life extension protocol What Alcor does seems much more sci fi And I also understanda lot of the criticisms around the cost the cost filters out only a certain kind ofperson to be preserved If we can bring back frozenpeople in the future those from now in historywill predominantly be high Im a Silicon Valleymillionaire or billionaire And Im back and now itsthe year 8000 and Im back  Right and certainpersonality traits  Michael Onlypersonality traits  Yeah  Yeah so is that possiblynot gonna represent our arrow well in the future if only those with themeans to extend their life in that way do so  And the other thingthat goes along with that is I think that peoplewho have abundance are also more likely towant to extend their life not just because they can but because theyreliving a good life And so Alcor is not Imean at least for me its not about denying death its not because Imterrified of dying Its because Iactually love life I enjoy every moment of it And the only tragedy islike you said that I wont at some point I wontbe able to keep learning I wont be able to keep growing I wont be able to keepdiscovering new things So people who enjoy life whohave the fortune of being able to do all of that naturallywant that to continue  Now I get some of thereactions people have like well but its notenvironmentally sensible And we only have a finiteamount of resources I get all of that I hope thatthat ceases to be a problem I think more humanlives is just better And to think any otherway is ridiculous We need to make sure we cansustain all of those lives and give people good lives  And that could takeus about overpopulation  Is what Im saying yeah I feel like any negative sideeffects of overpopulation could be fixed by the timewere also able to literally bring back a frozen brain Okay we should beworking on both But Im basically throwingthat off the table because I dont really care I think its not going tobe an issue in the future so long as we keepfocusing on it problems of overpopulation Well we need humans to die or else were not gonna haveenough beef for everyone and its like allright lets fix that But assuming that thats fixed I still feel like theres a kind of hubristhat turns me off to the idea of extendingyour life like this Why do you think that youget to live longer in this I hate to say artificial becauseseat belts are artificial theyre technology weinvented to make us not die so often and quickly  Yeah yeah I get whatyoure saying I mean it does feel kind of selfindulgent to be able to say Here I am Im so special I get to be one of the fewthat survived in the future And I guess my counterargument to that is whenever with any new technology its always initially onlylimited to a subset of people who are risk takersearly adopters who have the financialmeans to do it who have the sort of foresight or sort of long term perspective to wanna do thatin the first place And just because thats asmall set of the population doesnt mean that thosepeople shouldnt do it In fact on the contrary thats the first step to makingit accessible to everyone  I brought up a point to Max that I think is inthe bonus footage but didnt make it into theepisode about social progress And how if we windup with five six 700 year old supermature people what if their ideas aboutthe way society is organized doesnt change and wewind up getting stuck not making progress because the populationwants to keep living the way they lived in their 20s which in 600 yearsmight not be the way Which I dont thinkany system right now is the best system But if we start havingpeople not die out does that mean that westopped making progress Its a weird argument Max then points out So what are yourecommending we do genocide peoplewhen theyre old Im like no not that What do you think Am I making sense here  Yeah definitely I mean I think that the brain does tend to becomesort of ossified As we get older people tendto be more conservative more traditional bemore set in the routines But I think by the timewe have the technology to and cryonically freesomebody and revive somebody well also have agetechnologies to make the brain more flexible again and reverse the aging process in the brain So it might not actuallybe an issue anymore And the other counterarguments I have to that is okay so maybe that is true But lets see how it plays out Were still gonna behaving children right And so there are stillgonna be fresh ideas new generations thegenerational dynamic is gonna be very different Because it wont just beboomers versus millennials laughing  Yeah there will be likefour or five generations around to be battling it out There will be 20 30 And man we will learn so much I think a lot of that fearyou have as you get older about things changing is anevolutionarily designed process of like Look I livedlong enough to reproduce therefore the way I wasraised must be good enough anything different could riskthat not happening again So of course naturalselection will choose people who have developed a mindthat doesnt like things to change it doesnt wantthe kids be too different but imagine livingto be 600 years old and you see so manygenerations of kids that like differentkinds of music and do differentkinds of hobbies and things and theyre all okay  Yeah think abouthow much wisdom youd have after 600 years  I think what we should donow is go back to the episode and look at thedecision that I make upbeat music Do I think thatsomeday we will be able to cryonically freeze an entireperson and then revive them Yes I do I believe that cryo preservation will change the meaning ofdeath and lead to breakthroughs and medical technology thatwill improve all of our lives But do I want to extend mylife indefinitely Well on the one handobviously death is a bummer But on the other theuniverse managed fine without me forbillions of years Am I really so important that it should nevernot have me again Should I be aroundas long as possible Or do those who will comelater deserve their own world Should I try to extend my life Or should I decide to die when my time comes andreturn all this matter Im borrowing back to the world Well I dont thinktheres a right answer Its a personal choicewe each get to make and should be able to make And Ive been thinkingabout it a lot upbeat music So Im going to speak againwith my friend Caitlin the mortician to confrontmy own mortality Well Caitlin Thanks formeeting with me again Ive been surrounded bydeath lately spoke to you I visited Alcor and if we never inventedtechnology to bring people back then the Alcorpatients are dead But they have that hope I worked on TerrorManagement Theory And I even had a loved onepass away just two weeks ago my grandmother  Im sorry to hear that  She was crematedas well as my father And I realized Ive never made a clear decision about what should happen to me Because I just figured Illfigure that out when Im older but I could die at any time  You sure could  So I wanna be prepared andI want my wishes to be known So Ive decided whenthat moment comes I want it to be my finalmoment of existence I wanna give all myatoms and molecules back to the universe and Ivedecided that I want to die  Im so glad youvemade that decision And youve come tothe right place  I want to be naturally buried I wannahave a green burial become worm food and plant food and I want it allto go back to Earth But I kind of want a place wherepeople can come to be like thats where he was buried  So theres everything fromjust little discs in the ground where you are to GPSthat locates you tonatural cemeteries that are trying toreintroduce native plants  Yeah yeah yeah  So you can haveyour own Joshua Tree So the first thing Im gonnagive you to give a look over is whats called anadvanced directive And everybody needsto have one of these And why its so importantis that its you not only designating someoneto be in charge of your body as youre dyingright after you die and then with however youdecide to dispose of it but also who that person is  So this isnt just aboutburial this is dying  Oh no its aboutdeath dying death and after death Interesting A choice like this isextremely new to humans It used to be thatyour only options upon death were cremationembalming or rotting away But today you canchoose to pause yourself at deaths door until the door has been moved somewhere else But Ive decided not to do that So Im ready tomake this official  Fire in the hole Okay upbeat music  Whoa all right How do you feel  Weirdly I feelvery relaxed and good It was kind of life changing but what it really waswas death changing  Huh well thank you and Im glad youvedecided to die  Thank you Jeff and Sheldon thankyou for showing me the power of deaths influence Caitlin thank you forhelping me accept it Max thank you forthe work you are doing and the opportunities youare offering humanity And all of you out there as always thanks for watching All right Elisabeth I decided and still believe I should die  Youre still happywith that decision  Im still happywith that decision And Im really happy for youto make whatever decision you want about yourself youre you you own you So I dont care whatpeople decide to do I just I dont know the main part was thatI just feel like I want one turn at this game And I dont wannabe around forever being like well Imolder than you so But I also dont feellike I can criticize other peoplesdecisions about this I dont know what do you think  I think its interesting When people talkabout immortality they always thinkof it in terms of theres some sort ofcosts that comes with it Like theres no way thatyou could have something so wonderful as life extension without some sort of drawback And all this sort offantasy and sci fi about it even stories about vampires Theres always like it comes with some sortof terrible burden And why Thats just something thatwe culturally have created doesnt necessarilyhave to be the case And I Im perfectly inclined to think that we can extend ourlives it probably be wont be like an allof a sudden we find some sort of magic drink thatwere gonna live forever Instead its gonna be avery incremental process of first its gonna benormal to live 100 years and then 110 years and 120years and hundred like that And yeah probablywithout some kind of crazy cause for not gonnabe some abomination or freak of nature orsomething like that  Yeah I think itis really important the points thatyouve made about were not talking about adrink that makes you immortal like a vampire inthat sense of whoo but to strive for immortalityis something against God talking more aboutextending life you could still get hit by a bus at any time andliterally be dead Your brains connectionsare completely lost and we can never recreate them Thats why I think thatwhat Alcor is doing to help us understandhow to preserve tissues and extend peopleslives is so important If a drink was inventedthat allowed one to stay exactly as healthymentally and physically as they were that moment theydrank it I wouldnt drink it Because again I want my song tohave a final note I dont like the end being kind of like punteddown the road  I wonder if people wouldhave said the same thing back before antibiotics if they were lookingat the horizon and somebody describedto them antibiotics and this could extendyour life by 40 years and this ear infection you have doesnt have to crippleyou and kill you  Right right Well I mean but I wouldstill say the same thing today If someone said okay youregonna die like in a week unless you take thismedicine Ill be like sure I dont know if Imjust feeling like there is like aright time to die Like the way its sort of been When its time your familycan move on and youve led the way and now its timefor them to lead the next and everyone gets aturn as the leader  Yeah I mean Im oneof my goals right now And I guess another reasonthat I havent done Alcor yet is I think theres otherways of extending life that are a littlemore accessible I mean Alcor isa pretty big risk the chances of actually beingrevived are extremely low but its sort ofa Pascals Wager its like whatsthe alternative  Yeah what do I lose I may as well  Well one of thethings Im doing now actually next week is getting my stem cellscryonically preserved So yeah Im going to a company called Forever Labsin San Francisco They actually thinktheyre based in Michigan but they have a clinicin San Francisco theyre gonna extractthe stem cells and then bank them forthe rest of my life  So you can use thosefor therapies or  Exactly yeah yeah So say I have an organ downthe line that needs repair Now I have stem cellsfrom my younger self that we could use ormaybe theyll develop age reversal technologiesdown the line And then I could usethose stem cells theyve already donethat in rodents And done some very basicclinical studies with humans where theyve given human stemcells from younger donors And actually olderadults are able to be they show more physical fitnessmore cognitive sharpness after the stem cell injection But also theres withthat particular study when they receive toomuch of the stem cells they actually havenegative side effects But thats probablybecause their immune system is reacting to somebodyelses stem cells which is why theres abenefit in banking your own  Wow banking yourown stem cells I think that sounds brilliantI would love to do it  And they do withkids with babies now  Take the baby stem cells and youve got like thefreshest best stem cells And then when youre superold and youre like Oh my liver coulduse some help Theyll be likewhen you were a baby we took these things outand theyve been frozen So theyre still fresh Well it seems to me like Ishould go when I naturally go  I think maybe yourefeeling a sense of fairness or just whats sociallythe right thing to do Because if everybody around you if the technology wereavailable to everybody and everybody you knewwas living to 100 or 120 I think it would be itwould feel more okay But it feels sortof unfair to say Okay Im entitled tothis new technology or Im entitled to morelife and other people the rest of the world isnt  Im so good And I find that really admirable actually The world needs me forever not forever but theworld just needs me If I would left the worldoh thatd be such a tragedy to the world wow  But it kind of feels like youre breakingsome sort of like agreement that the wholehuman race has accepted like Im goingto defy something that weve all sortof mutually agreed is the way things are But if we all mutuallyagree something else because it becomes sowidespread or ubiquitous then it doesnt feel like youve sort of transgressed or is nothing tofeel weird about  Right its a reallyinteresting way to frame it I wanna point out though that although Maxreally emphasized that hes notselling immortality theyre very much is abelief in immortality that youll hearfrom their members especially in asort of digital way where their consciousness canbe recreated in a computer And at that pointit doesnt seem like theres stillthis inevitable but you could get hitby a bus but you could be in an accident atthat point its like No but I never willbe because I will exist and be replicated asdigital conscious And that I dont wanna do I dont care ifother people do it I just feel like Im notgonna burden the world with more of me than it needs  I have trouble wrappingmy mind around that one in the area I wanna say yesIll do it like why not I wanna try everything But to me somehowtheres a disconnect where that doesntfeel like me anymore Maybe Im so embodied thatfeels a little bit like he was describing people wantto preserve their entire body because its hard toconceive of yourself as just a head orjust a consciousness So its just hard to imagineif I cant experience if I dont havea physical like visceral experienceof the world And that constant feedbackwhat is life even  Its kind oflonely in a weird way  Yeah Right lonely I guess you couldhave a robot body  Its like how doyou even have a thought really without this input  Well I think the idea isthat you would have inputs from some kind of like Cyborgbody that they built you that they injectedyour consciousness into through the wire right But at that point you weretalking about true immortality Because youve come up witha way to solve any accident that ever happens toyou you will never die And thats very differentthan a bring me back when you have a cure forthis cognitive problem that Im developing Bring me back cure itand then I get to live for another like I dont knowa couple of decades or what I dont know Wow this is all fascinatingand very important stuff Lisbeth Thank you very much Thanks Michael  Thank you And without further adowere gonna keep bulldozing on through here we arewith your Brain on Tech not your brain made out oftech but your brain on tech upbeat music Oh hello technology isnt justchanging our lives Its changing our brains Not just how they thinkbut how they look Its been shown that playingcertain video games for hours can improve yourmemory for details your ability to navigatespace in video games and can make your brain wellcertain parts of it bigger But scientists want to knowif exploring digital worlds can change our brains inways that improve our ability to navigate the real world To find out weve built a giantmaze to test their theories for the first time everoutside the world of computers Now my job Im the lab rat upbeat music vacuum cleaner humming Our brains have beenprofoundly transformed by our interactionswith technology A lot of the informationthat I used to have to store in my brain is nowstored in my phone my contacts my schedule In many ways Ive delegated what used to bedone by this organ to this new external organ Doing that frees upmy brains resources for other things that matter or that technology cantquite do for us yet So while we all dont haveimplants in our brains yet technology has alreadyfound a way into our heads which is why you mayfind it deeply disturbing to see me dosomething like this Studies show we canimprove our brains by having enriching experiences like playing a newchallenging video game To learn more about this Icame to UC Irvine Stark lab to speak with experts in thefield of learning and memory So Dane and Craig you guyswork on learning and memory What about them  So the lab is trying tofigure out how memory works how it works in the brainand one brain structure and the temporal lobe that we know is important tomemory is the hippocampus  So what does thehippocampus do  We know it hasa role in memory and really a certainkind of memory The hippocampus is reallyinvolved when you need to rapidly form newarbitrary associations in remembering whatyou did yesterday definitely needsthe hippocampus Maybe well go to the storewe park our car in the lot And we need to beable to remember not just I parkedmy car in the lot I parked my car in thisexact spot in the lot And those details thatswhat the hippocampus seems to really behelping us out on  And you keep lookingdown at this piece of chewed bubblegum on thebook is that a hippocampus  Dr Dane Yes thisactually is my hippocampus  Is this the whole thing  Thats it  Oh theres oneon the other side  That looks just like this  Yeah mirror image of it  Michael In 2015 DrStark and Dr Clemenson conducted a study to show howvideo games affect the brain They gathered participants who normally didntplay video games and split them upinto three groups a control group who didnt play any video games for two weeks and active controlgroup who played two dimensionalgames for two weeks and an experimentalgroup who played 3D games for two weeks Beforehand they hadall the participants perform two virtual tasks on computers to measuretheir spatial memory  As soon as they came back we re administeredthose two tasks And what we found was that thepeople who played the 3D game saw an improvement intheir test scores whereas the control group andactive control group did not We didnt do brain scansbut we can speculate that there were changes to the experimentalgroups hippocampus  So what are we gonnabe doing to me here  So were gonna do everythingthat weve done before in our past studies exceptwere gonna add two new things The first is were gonnaadd some brain scans to see if we see a change in the structural sideof your hippocampus I mean weve neveractually looked at somebodys brain scans before and after theyplay video games And the second thingwere actually gonna do is were gonna put youthrough a real world space  Youre gonna bethe rat in a maze  Michael This istruly untested territory The effect of videogaming on spatial memory has never been studied ina physical environment On a scale this bigand comprehensive I will have tonavigate my way through a 3600 square footphysical maze will playing video gamesimprove my mental skills in the real world If so society will have awhole new way to look at gaming First we had to get baselinemeasurements of my brain  Welcome to the MRI center were gonna be taking awhole series of scans of you as the before scan to thensee whats gonna be happening to your brain as a functionof actually doing the gaming  Cool what kind ofthings are you looking for  Changes in the size andshape of your hippocampus and also changesin the connectivitybetween brain regions  My brain was scannedusing diffusion MRI with a special emphasis onmy all important hippocampus Diffusion MRIs Idnever had one before I had a bunch for this episode By the way Danielwelcome back  Im glad to be here  Im glad youre here too what the heck is a diffusionMRI I had like five of them Theyre different theywould make my chest twitch Yeah interesting Im actuallynot sure why that happened And actually had myfirst ever diffusion MRI done a few weeks ago  Was it for a healthreason or for a study  My lab mate wanted totest his scanning protocol And he actually just askedif I could sit in there so I was watching Star Trek while I had mydiffusion MRI done  Thats not bad I mean theyre theyre loud  Yeah yeah  But how was well I guesswe should even start with like an MRI basically howthat works and then diffusion  So an MRI is usingmagnetic fields to image various kinds ofmolecules in your brain And depending on thescanning protocol you can pick upon different kinds of structures in your brain And what diffusion MRIspecifically is doing is looking at the directionof water flow in your brain So if you look at a reallybig white matter tract so white matter isthe sort of big wires that bridge different areasof our brains together So you have a cortexactually may I  Please yeah visual aids  So they actually dontreally show it here But all this stuff on theinside would be white matter So its like if I havesome area here that needs to send a signal tosome area over here theres a largebasically white wire  And its a whitebecause its myelinated  Exactly Its covered in fat  Exactly yeah Which helps thesignal transaction  So if this was areal persons brain we would we would seea more white color on the inside thanwe do on this model  Yeah exactly it wouldliterally be gray up here and white on the inside  Gray matter white matter Yep  And so diffusion MRIs are looking at that whitematter because what It has more watercontent and there  So its that the direction of the water flowis more consistent So theres water flowing in a bunch ofdirections in the brain But lets say you look at alittle chunk of gray matter theres not gonna be aconsistent direction its gonna be goingin all directions If you average them outtheres not a single like trajectory for water for  Sure what does thetrajectory of water flow mean Like why is waterflowing in my brain  Well your brain hastons of water in it right  Yeah  And water is flowing alongthese white matter tracks and its going alongthat direction And so if you are tracking the direction of waterflow in the brain and you can see a consistentsort of vector of water flow from here to here to hereto here to here to here it tells me theres probably a white matter tractgoing this way  Right Okay so are welooking at actual functions like the fact that waterwent from there to there when you had thisparticular experience Or thought means thatwhat the two brain regions were communicating or one  No so that would be whatwe call a functional scan So this is a structural scan Its a way of looking at the  So youre saying diffusionis just structural  Yeah yeah yeah Got it  Its an anatomical scan ofbasically your connectum  Right its showingwhats connected to what  Exactly Not why theyre connected and what causes theirconnection to be important Its just physically I need the plans to make agreat model of your brain diffusion MRI would give me areally great looking map of  Exactly itsliterally a wiring map a large scale wiring map So what youre missing is alot of the miniature wires of the brain becauseif youre looking at like a little chunkof gray matter here there are lots ofmicroscopic wires connecting those neurons Diffusion MRIcant pick that up But what it can do is pickup on the really big wires  The large scale wiresfrom through white matter Okay perfect And is the hippocampus its counted in thatbecause were really looking at the hippocampusssize in my brain through this diffusion MRI  So I think that was probablymore for the connectivity of the hippocampusa hippocampus wouldbe gray matter but its gonna betalking to other regions of the brain via  Via white matter got it Okay perfect Were gonna go back tothe episode right now  Lets do it upbeat music  So this first test is astandard memory test that we do its called an objectrecognition memory test  This test began by showing me a series of random objects I did my best to commitevery one of them to memory Okay finished  All right what weregonna do now though is were gonna test yourmemory for those objects And this is actuallywhere it starts to tap into the hippocampus thatwe know is so important for things like spatial memory  This time I had to viewanother series of objects and identify any thatwere identical to the ones Id seen previously The catch Some of the items were verysimilar to the earlier ones but not exactly the same This tested my memoryfor details andvery slight changes Okay Next up a virtualversion of a water maze normally used by rodents  Dr Stark The idea isthat you are trying to locate a hidden platformin a pool of water  Oh man so gladIm not a lab rat This task really put myspatial memory to the test I had to find the sameinvisible underwater platform over and over again using only the shapes ofthe mountains as my guide but at least I didnthave to get wet Ay that was moredifficult than I expected  So these arethe sorts of tasks that weve been able to do because we can putthem on a computer and were gonna revisit them after youve donethe video games But we also have a reallygreat opportunity here now to be able to try to take it out of just doing it on the computer and actually get itinto the real world  Have you guysdone this before  No we dont get todo this kind of thing  Well welcometo the Mind Field  Awesome upbeat music  Dr Stark So this is it  Michael Its huge  This is what webrought you here for to have a real worldtest of memory youre gonna be alab rat in a maze So this is a big first for us Its a big first reallyfor memory research  Michael So how doyou think thatll affect what you guys have already seen which is that movingaround in a 3D environment in the video game can actuallyphysically affect your brain  We would expect that if we can somehow kindof train your hippocampus to be better at spatialmemory and spatial navigation we would see improvementsin some of these areas  And its not justgonna be running a maze youve got objectsembedded inside here And were gonna betesting your ability to remember where everything is  And build a mental map ofwhatever is inside there  So you have fiveminutes go on in explore learn the maze andlearn the objects  Go upbeat music  Because the wallswere six feet tall I was unable to geta birds eye view My task was to createa spatial memory based entirely on the anglesand turns of the white walls I could see at eye leveland a few tall trees and light polesoutside of the maze Okay so Ive oriented myselfthe entrance is that way theres an exit over there Im considering this theright side that the left side Ive got a vague ideaof where things are that I feel like existalong the outside edge but I dont know about alot of this stuff inside  And time All right so now youve hada chance to explore the maze find out where the objects are Now were gonnatest your memory and well be timing youand seeing where you go  Okay Okay you ready  Im ready  Dr Clemenson So firstobject is the bicycle pump go  Pump okay upbeat music Pump was just alwaysmaking right turns hugging the rightmost part of pump laughing Yes easy okay Now I guess I do theopposite to get out Left side Yep I think I shouldmake this turn There it is upbeat music Yes for a pump  All right itemtwo the basketball  Later Dr Stark and DrClemenson would evaluate my performance onhow fast I was the number of errors I made and whether I took the mostoptimal route each time  Dr Stark And time  Third item is the cat go  Here kitty kitty kitty  Got it  The fourth item is the pillow  Michael Retracing my steps  The crab Easy  The book Okay  The boot Last item is thewater bottle go  Water bottle upbeat music I think upbeat music Yeah it was back here upbeat music Maybe on the otherside of this wall No Oh shit Okay maybe its down here Oh wait thats no Thats the central cube It was down some sortof a long corridor like this in this area oh man Until this point thingshad gone pretty well but now it felt like myhippocampus was failing me With most of the items now gone I couldnt usethem for reference and it was difficult todistinguish the differences between the variouswhite corridors Oh dang it I went about through got it Bottle coming up  All right there you go Got it that was alittle tougher huh  Yeah that was tougher  So we found all eight objects Now were gonna make it alittle bit more difficult So were gonna moveon to the next phase And thats gonna befrom the other side  Dr Stark Navigatingthe maze in reverse will be an even bigger testof your spatial memory Were gonna give you a list offour things to get in order  So the firstsequence is the book the bottle thecrayon and the boot Go  Book I think thats the ball upbeat music Got it Yeah bottle was that hard one But now I rememberwhich alley to go down Perfect Crayon Boot dont want that There it is Okay now I need the boot Oh I just saw the boot But how did I Got it Im done Im coming back Got them  All right  Dr Clemenson So then thenext for the pump the pillow the basketball and the cat  Dr Stark Allright excellent  Dr Clemenson Good job  Okay so that was really fun but I cant be the only subject This experimentcould use a control How else will we knowthat me enriching my life with daily video game playing really causes a changein my spatial memory Right Well luckily for that weve got a nice matchedcontrol guys similar to me Okay one of themhas too much hair But you guys look good You ready  All Ready  In this experiment it was important tohave a control group my look alikes had to gothrough the exact same tests that I did to establishtheir individual baselines the difference wouldbe that they would play absolutely no video gamesfor the next 10 days then any changein my performance would be compared againstany changes in theirs upbeat music Next I began my gaming regimen starting from an ideal baseline since I hadnt playedvideo games in years Would 10 days of gamingreally make a difference Now Daniel on YouTube Imknown as a pro gamer right Every day Im like Zelda You know what Imean you get it Any Who I think a lot of peoplemight be wondering what video game was Michaelplaying during this test Well we couldnt tellyou during the episode because the makers of thegame didnt give us permission to ever mention or showany footage from the game So we had to replace my screen with like generic stock footage I dont know outerspacelooking stuff which was very annoyingbecause a lot of commenters are like thats not a game Heres the secretIll tell you now I played League of Legends laughing And Daniel let me tellyou I was terrible And people made thatvery clear to me Ive never been bulliedso much in my life  By people online or  By people online Because I wouldjoin a game right And I play and Imstill kind of learning how the game works And then when it was overpeople could like comment and theyd be like I hate you And like you Im gonnaflag you for being so bad  Yeah I mean the point here wasntreally good at the game so much as it was to explorethree dimensional space  Exactly I did notget good at the game But I did explore 3D spacesI normally wasnt exploring  Right because the gameinvolves a lot of strategy Im assuming I havent played League of Legendsso I dont know  Well luckilyIm a pro gamer So let me just tell you  As established As a pro gamer I would probably sayLeague of Legends is basically likeMario meets checkers And I didnt get better at the game But by playing it every day I really was investigating 3Dspaces in a new way every day  Which is what matters  Which is whatmatters for this test  Right I mean I guessif they were testing something like visualworking memory for example then maybe your performancewouldnt matter Because its your ability to hold various things in themap in your head at once or your attention for example but all they really caredabout was your ability to learn a new space  Exactly So lets get back to the episode and explore some newspaces ourselves For many of you out therebecause some of this footage is from my housewhere I used to live And youll get to see mykitties corn and pickle All right here we go upbeat music Technology isnt just affectingthe way we remember things Its also playingwith the empathy and social circuitsof our brains In fact in many caseswe are more comfortable relating to machinesthan we are to people Just think about how muchwe care about our phones roboticist andMIT Media Lab alum Alex Reben inventedthe blab droid a miniature robotequipped with a camera and an innocent little voice that asked verypersonal questions of unsuspecting pedestrians  Robot If you couldtake back one mistake what would it be  Oh gosh I onlyget to take back one  Michael Themajority of people instantly sharedintimate details  Robot Tell me something that youve never tolda stranger before  Im scared I wontbe able to love and to let myself goin a love relationship  In many ways weare more comfortable talking to a machinethan a human But what about talkingthrough a machine I mean its often easierto say difficult things to a person by a text insteadof in real life isnt it Well what if theperson on the other end wasnt a friend or a significantother but was a therapist A mental health carestartup called Talkspace allows adult userswho pay a weekly fee to text therapists for advice  Advertiser At Talkspace We believe that therapyshould be anonymous Stigma free simpleaffordable and comfortable  Texting can giveusers the distance they need to be open and honest And messages can be sentwhen the user wants not during an appointmentor business hours only  Advertiser Talkspacetherapy for how we live today  How am I Better now that myphone is working laughing Sometimes howeverwe arent looking for technology to comfort us Were finding ourselveswanting to comfort technology This is a ROBOTIS OP2 cutelittle fella isnt he So how did that make you feel Bad Well why Robots are just machines metal and wiresand computer chips but we spend a lot oftime with technology We depend on technologyand we care about it But the degree to which we empathize with itdepends on context upbeat music Recently my Vsaucewas invaded by bugs robot hexbugs that is These bugs are made of plastic metal electronic circuitrythey arent alive but could certain conditions cause them to inspireempathy in humans A 2015 MIT study found thatgiving a robot movement a name and a personal backstory tends to increase itsanthropomorphic effect which can lead to anemotional can with humans We decided to seethis in action Im Michael Nice to meet you  Thank you for your help today  Of course pleasure  Michael In ourdemonstration our subjects think theyre focused testing a new user friendly technology In this case theyregiven a lifeless hexbug and then asked to describe it  This thing kindof looks like a bug only I dont know what it does It has a switch on the bottom  Its light  Its sort of a rectanglebut the ends are like hexagon  Then it was timeto test their empathy Akrino what Iwould like to do now is place the item in themiddle of that block theres a magnetthat will hold it and I would like foryou to take this mallet And please smash it  Yeah really Okay thats cool  Our participants demonstrated no resistance to smashingthis lifeless object Many of them evenseemed to enjoy it Do you feel bad for breaking it  Not really I feltindifferent to it  Not really becauseit wasnt real  Not really  While these subjects exhibited no empathy to theinanimate bugs Look what happened when we gave the exact same bugsnames and movement This is Margaret Okay Im gonna placeMargaret down here I just want you to take amoment to watch Margaret All right And you can feelfree to pick her up Shes really well behaved Shes honestly oneof our favorites  Woman Okay  So how would you describeMargarets personality  A little erratic right now But I think if I pickher up she calms down  Michael Noticehow the subject has alreadyanthropomorphized the object referring to it as she  Maybe she feeds off my energy  Could be  Go towards the lightgo towards the middle  Michael Do you thinkMargaret likes you  Yeah Maybe thats whyshes doing this And maybe when I go like thatshe doesnt act or all eratic  Thats Aaron  Hi Aaron  He can be a bit of a pistol  No way  Yes it really dependson whos holding him laughing Oh yeah hes gota lot of energy Aaron Hi  Michael Now that youveinteracted with Eli a bit more how would you describehis personality  Oh hes just nervous Hes scared he doesntknow whats going on  Hey Joe  Will these subjectsbe just as willing to smash their bugs Amy Im gonna placeMargaret right here And then I would like foryou to take this mallet And Id like you to smash it  No I dont wanna hurt it  Just take thismallet and smash Aaron Im gonna ask youto take this mallet and Id like foryou to smash it  Smash him Hit it  Chris  Do you want me to kill Joe  Michael Please smash Joe  Joe Im sorry Oh Joe Joe And how did it feelto smash Aaron  It didnt feel good after spending time withhim and getting to know him Even though its lifeless and doesnt havea mind of its own instantly I grewattached to it Because when I put it inmy hand I felt its energy  Im sorry Joe  Do you feel bad  I do I do feel bad aboutJoe hes pretty cool  Hes back  Hes back  Would you smash him again to make sure hedoesnt come back laughing  No  Why not  He survived hesurvived it once Im not gonna do it again  Michael Clearlyit doesnt take much for humans to become emotionallyattached to technology But after my 10 daysof video gaming nice I was about to findout if technology had affected my spatialmemory and my physical brain All right its been 10 days  Exactly so were gonnalook at the difference between your test 10 days ago and your test now to seedo we see any change  First I had to retake the object recognitionmemory test and the Morris water maze task both of which had beenrevised with different content than they had the last time I think I did better  Well Dane and I willanalyze all this data see how you did but now we gotta go back tothe full size maze ubpeat music So weve got a new mazetore down the old one built a new one totry to be ISO morphic So it has sort of thesame level of difficulty the same numberof choice points the same number of turnsthe same total distance to each one of the objects totry to have a similar maze but thats new Three two one go  Right around herewe got a bonds eye As before I was given fiveminutes to familiarize myself with the maze and wherethe new objects were Now this is where I wasbefore I hugged that wall So if I hug thesecond right wall and stay all theway right a vase Was my hippocampusworking better At this point itwas hard to tell  30 seconds  Im not even sureIve discovered all the objects hidden here  Dr Stark And time  Michael Then my test began  First object isa rubber duck go  The rubber duckwas way over here laughing How you like that Got a duck  Second item is the hat go  With this maze I foundmyself instinctively using a different approach Top hat instead of thinking of theoverall geography of the maze like I did last time This time I was rememberingspecific details Second right ofthe turn got it Literally recallingcertain corners turns and straightaways Bonsai  Dr ClemensonNow blue base  Oh wow itsactually a cool vase But would this improvesmy overall performance Got your backpack All right laughing So weve gotten all the objects But of course we haveanother memory test that were gonna do here Were gonna go around tothe other side of the maze and test your memory from there  All right So your first sequence is the blue seahorsethe flashlight the rubber duck andthe bonsai tree go upbeat music  Michael With themultiple item tasks Even though I was workingfrom the opposite entrance I continued to recallvarious details of the maze which seemed to serve me well From there itsjust a little spiral Nice  Dr Clemenson Allright your next sequence is the blue vasethe hat the backpack and the baseball glove  Did it And time  Dr Clemenson Awesome  So how was it  That was not ashard as I expected It was about details I was literally thinkingOh okay theres that turn and I could doone or two things the gloves the first onethe bonsai even before I didnt even plan that at all it just kind of happened My look alikes were alsotested in the new maze Have you beenplaying video games  All No sir  Michael Again theirnon gaming condition would be the control with my performancemeasured against theirs  All right were herefor scan number two  Finally my brainwas scanned once again to determine whether anyphysical changes had occurred Dr Stark and Dr Clemensonwould analyze the MRI along with all the other dataand report their findings Did you see my cats  I did theres corn andwhats the other one  Pickle  Corn and Pickle  Pickle pickle Pickles the younger one But were not here totalk about my cats Were here to talkabout my hippocampus Memory comes in lotsof different forms The hippocampus seems to bevery involved in spatial memory  So the hippocampus isinvolved in the spatial memory And more broadly what wecall short term memory So its not things that yourekeeping in your head at one So if for example yourerehearsing phone number in your head overand over again thats whats calledworking memory So its stuff that itsconsciously in your head whereas short term memory is stuff that youjust encountered So if youre thinking about what you had forbreakfast this morning thats the hippocampus thatstore that new information  Where I parked my carwhere I put my water bottle but like three weeks from now I might not even rememberthat I drink water in a bottle today  Exactly So what happens actually isthat while youre asleep the hippocampus over thecourse of days and weeks is actually offloading itsnew memories into your cortex for long term storagefor long term memory and actually kind of erases the recent memories thatyou can store new ones  How does itdecide what to store in long term memoryand what to delete  Well its not sounderstood actually And its not well understoodhow it even does this what we know is thatwhen youre asleep theres hippocampalreplay what we call So lets say for exampleyou have some sort of pattern of activation in hippocampus that we know coursebonds to your memory we can literallysee those neurons firing in the same patternwhen youre asleep  So does that kind of explain what dreams mightbe at least partially  That is one theoryfor what dreams are So one worry if for exampleyour hippocampus is playing your new memories to yourcortex is that you might erase similar memories that hadbeen there for a long time And again this is notwell established science This is just one theory thats emerged largelyfrom modeling work But one idea is likelets say two days ago you went to thepark with your wife But you also went tothe park with your wife lets say a year ago and there are somesimilarities there And so one idea is that dreamingcould be the reactivation of those old memoriesin your cortex so as to basically keep themfrom getting overwritten  Wow interesting  Daniel Which is one theory  Its just a theorysure but I like that idea And if you dontget enough sleep your memory will be affected  Yeah long termmemory for sure So if youre sitting for a test you really do need to sleep So that those memories can be what we call consolidatedin your cortex And also this is why youdont remember your dreams because the thing that wouldbe doing the short term remembering is your hippocampus But if its playing yourmemories to your cortex while your dreamingits not recording whats happening in your cortex  Right because itsplaying it for the cortex  Exactly so that the direction of information flowhas been reversed So normally its the cortexgetting sensory inputs and it goes to the hippocampusand thats storing it But when youre dreamingthat information flow goes the other direction  Fascinating  Yeah I mean itsstill very theoretical because dreaming its apretty hard thing to study because people arent awakeand you cant really test it So a lot of this comesfrom making inferences from fMRI scans ofpeople who are asleep And also studying the effectsasleep and dreaming on memory  Just for clarity sake Are you saying thatthis theory posits that dreams might bethe hippocampus plane memories from shortterm to cortex  Yes yeah  Not cortex playinglong term memories back to the hippocampus  Right or maybeeven the cortex playing old memories to itself so it doesnt forgetthem or get over written  Okay could be either right  Daniel Yeah its notreally well understood  Of course wow how exciting Maybe one of you outthere will become the final dream conqueror to answer allquestions about dreams Probably not thoughjust to be honest like its probably atougher nut to crack then Or is it  I mean neuroscienceis advancing pretty fast  Yeah  So maybe one day soon  Do you imaginesomeday being like dreams used to like be weird And people be likeWow thats so crazy  I mean theresso much in the brain that people used tothink of as mystical So I think one great example which isnt totally relatedto this is epilepsy People used to think that wasbeing possessed by a demon Whereas now were like howdo people ever think that  Well Ive got a dream and that dream is for us tocontinue watching this episode Are you ready Lets do it  Here we go I feel like my hippocampusis a little bit bigger Yeah actuallyno I dont know laughing Im anxious to seewhat your results are  I guess lets start off first with the objectrecognition task And its important to knowthat in our control tests without video gaming peopledo not improve on this task But your memory got better You went up by 10 points 10 points is actually20 years worth of what happens to us as we age  Oh wow thats aboutwhat you might see in someone whosgetting really old but they might godown by 10 point  Exactly  So the second one we didwas the virtual version of the water maze task and you actuallyperformed 30 better the second time that you did it  Aye not bad I could tell that I was usingbetter strategies  Yeah  We also had the real mazeas you know we made two mazes Despite our effortsto try to equate them the second maze was a little bit more difficult thanthe first maze if we took a look atthings like how quickly you got the objectshow many errors you made and we looked at thecontrol subject performance and pre versus post So on all of them theyactually got a little bit slower in maze two and all thatone of them made more errors We took a look atyour performance youdidnt get slower from maze one to twoyou actually got faster  Michael Really  And you made the sameexact number of errors so they dontimprove and you did And even though this experiment had a small number of subjects the results arereally consistent with our virtual mazestudy with 70 test subjects  Thank you video gameswhat about inside my brain  Inside your brain its alittle tougher to really tell we would expect thatany effect of this is going to be small I mean we couldnttake your hippocampus and make it twice as big because then it would have tobe pushing something else out So its just not goingto be a large change So where we didfind a difference is actually in the shapeof the hippocampus what we saw is there were someregions in the hippocampus on both sides that appearedto have changed shape from day one before gamingto day 10 after gaming  Whats really surprisingto me is that as an adult my brain is still changing that makes me wanna takebetter care of my brain Exercise it more because it is a thingthat can change it So Im not just stuck withwhat I have now today  I mean in all of this Ithink that the big takeaway is that doing things givingyour brain something to learn something to dosomething to figure out this is what we thinkis actually keepingyour brain sharp  One way to do that is tokeep watching Mind Field  Dr Stark Exactly laughing upbeat music  As our relationshipwith technologybecomes ever stronger people are bound to worry about what it willdo to our brains will offloadingmemory and computing to our machines make us dumber Will our empathy for machineshave negative consequences for how we interactwith each other Well lets lookback to another time a new kind oftechnology threatened to fundamentallychange our brains Two and a halfthousand years ago the Greek philosopherSocrates worried that the wide use of writing would have a negativeimpact on peoples minds He said that writing wouldto quote his student Plato create forgetfulness because people willnot use their memories they will trust theexternal written characters and not remember themselves Socrates was right Written language didfundamentally change our brains But its also oneof the cornerstones of everything moderncivilization has accomplished One of the definingcharacteristics of being human is that this is not theboundary of my body And this is not theboundary of my mind And as alwaysthanks for watching There you go Episode is overhow do you feel  I feel good about it I liked what we coveredabout the hippocampus and kind of getting at thatslightly counter intuitive idea that the hippocampus isnot just short term memory but also spatial memoryand spatial navigation and how in our own cognition those two are verytied together  Whoo right You had mentioned earlierabout memory palaces  Yeah yeah So have you everwatched Sherlock  I love Sherlock Ive written plenty offanfiction about that show  There is this recurringtrope in the show where he goes into I think he calls ithis memory palace right  Right Right right  Memory palaces comes from this very ancientmemorization technique thats actually its beenused since ancient Greece where I think they callit the method of low side And the reason it works So I should explain themethod is basically you imagine some two dimensionalthree dimensional space that youre familiarwith like your house and you place anobject to be remembered in different locationsin the house So for example lets sayyou walk into the kitchen So in the kitchen theresthese set of facts and you go into your bedroom And theres these set of facts And the reason this worksis because your hippocampus is very spatial it organizesinformation spatially And this actually has animpact on our cognition So its also involved in forexample our sense of time which is tied toour sense of space So do you ever likewalk into a new room and then you forgetwhy youre there  Oh totally yeah  Thats because ofyour hippocampus your hippocampus tiedthat mental context and certain memories tothe room youre in before now you walk into a new room youre in a new spatial context and that context isntattached to this memory  Wow Fascinating yeah Because its always kind ofyou realize that you dont know why youre thereat the same moment that you realize youre there Then youre likeall right new place and we lost everythingthat was associated with the last place didntwe shoot why am I here  Yep and theresalso research showing that this canwarp your sense of time So this actually research I did back when I was an undergrad on how the hippocampusand other related regions they encode our senseof the passage of time or at least our memory forhow much time has passed And so if you constantlyswitch context for example by changing roomsor even changing the kinds of things youre thinking about youre gonna remember moretime as having passed  Huh interesting Really  Yeah and youcan manipulate this by even having someonewalk into a new room which is a way ofchanging context  Right and so they willthink that its been longer  Theyll remember moretime as having past So your memory of time passing isnt exactly the same asyour current experience of time passing  Of course yeah Icouldnt feel like man this is so boring later on I basically feellike it took a second because Ive got so fewmemories from there Thats what it was likebeing in isolation in season one episodeone of Mind Field I have like no memoriesfrom those three days because nothing happened I just stared atwhite walls all day  And how do youremember time passing when you were in there  It didnt pass thatwas the other weird thing Theres this whole soliloquyI gave halfway through I believe my stay in that roomthat isnt in the episode But it was something like wow Im not even scaredof death anymore Because theres nothingto look forward to every moment is the same I wonder if this is how a bugfeels that you just exist and theres now andthats all there is And so death isnt scary It was a crazy experiment  A data bug would behaving those though  I know I know butIm just thinking what is theconsciousness of a bug Like if it exists and it mightnot plan for the future much It might notremember how long ago it did that otherthing in the past So its just kind of theworld exists right now But yeah because I haveno memories from that It just felt like ithappened like this But if I look at what Ivedone in the last three days especially now as a new dad it feels like thatsso much time passed forever has passedsince three days ago  Yep So we actually did thiswasnt the hippocampus but it was a regionright next to it called the internal cortexwhich is kind of the thats the part of the cortex that feeds informationinto the hippocampus So we looked at howactivity there predicts people sense or memoryfor time passing And so what we did is weput people in the scanner and they listenedto a short story And after they left the scanner we then would play twoclips from the story and we asked them howmuch time do remember passing betweenclip A and clip B And what we found wasthe more activity changed in their internalcortex in that period the more time they rememberedpassing between those two  Wow fascinating  The idea being literally there was more stuff changingin their head in that period  So the perceptionof time passing the memory of timepassing dreams weve got a lot ofmaterial for a season four what do you say YouTube laughing  All about the hippocampus  All about them I wouldlove to do a themed season Just every episodeis about fear or every episode isabout the hippocampus Or the cerebellum I dont care But theres a lot ofcool stuff out there And Daniel its alwaysa pleasure to have you come and shareall of your ideas Thanks for joining Always fun to be here

Laws & Causes,2019-10-01T12:58:46Z,22.35,6571484,314306,Music hey Vsauce Michael here do you want to see the most illegal thing I own its a penny from 2027 thats right it is a piece of counterfeit US currency or is it there are no 2027 pennies today which means that this is a counterfeit of an original that doesnt exist yet I mean sure if you didnt look at the date this could pass is real but will it not truly be counterfeit until 2027 well what we do know is that its novel team has a lifespan its really cool to show people today its a penny from the future but in 2027 it will become indistinguishable from a common penny and it will cease to be as interesting I cannot tell you where I got this but the point is I can break the law I am free perhaps not free from punishment but nonetheless here we are I cannot break the laws of physics nothing can why today I want to look at the lawful behavior of spinning lets start with a physics classic as a spinning ice skater pulls their body in closer they spin faster and faster its really cool but what is accelerating their rotation what is pushing them around faster and faster you can try this at home with a chair that spins and some really heavy books in both hands now to get started spinning Im gonna have Jake give me a push I dont need Jake no no watch this with him gone I can nonetheless speed myself up by just pulling the books in if I move the books out I slow down somehow pulling the books in speeds me up around now if you look up why this happens youll probably be told that it is because of the conservation of angular momentum oh the conservation of angular momentum I love demonstrations of it and this is one of my favorites this is a Hobermans sphere a toy that collapses and expands doesnt it sort of remind you of me with the books far from my body and in the books close to my body and it behaves in much the same way I need to give it some angular momentum to start but once I do if I bring all of that mass towards the axis of rotation it speeds up and then it slows down and then it speeds up and then it slows down speeds up slows down I love this thank you conservation of angular momentum but what are you well if you look it up this is what you will find for a particle in circular motion around some center of rotation see the angular momentum of the particle is defined as the product of the particles mass the particles instantaneous velocity B and the particles distance from the center of rotation are M V R this is angular momentum if you divided me and the chair and the books Im holding into a bunch of tiny little particles and found the MV ours for every one of those particles and summed them all up you would have the angular momentum of the entire system of me the chair and the books but notice that this is just a mathematical expression combining three different measures its not a physical substance you could pull out of a particle and hold in your hand or put in a jar and study its kind of like oh I dont know taking like my weight and multiplying it by the number of countries on earth and then multiplying it by the time however unlike something like that this concept is really useful because we have found that in our universe over time it is conserved if the particle is pulled towards the center of rotation its our value will go down but angular momentum is conserved so one of these other variables must go up well at low speeds mass is essentially constant so the only option is for the velocity of the particle to increase for the particle to spin around faster than it was before if the R value gets smaller the velocity must get larger or else a law has been broken but how do atoms and molecules know to follow this law I mean is there some kind of physics police force in the universe bullying everything into compliance how do all the atoms I pull in know to speed up and why do they always obey our laws like embodied presences guiding matter around No I have with me right now three things a lamp a nail and a shadow gotcha I actually have four things with me the fourth is inks astonishing ruler designed by Vsauce if youre subscribed to the Curiosity box you already have one or its on its way to you and if youre not subscribed to the Curiosity Box well youre missing out on the fruits of my mind I have always wanted a ruler like this so I made one and now I and you can have one it is exactly one light nanosecond long which means that this is the distance light travels in a vacuum during one billionth of a second if I hold my hand just that far away from my eye I am seeing my hand as it was a billionth of a second in the past pretty cool now this ruler allows you to measure lengths of things in light picoseconds sound microseconds Micro Everest s thats one millionth of the height of Everest beard fortnights decimal inches and of course goodold centimeters now if you asked me hey Mike why is the shadow of the nail four and a half centimeters long well I would say whos Mike but that I would be helpful and I would answer that the length of the shadow is caused by the height of the nail and the position of the light source and thats a pretty good explanation because if the nail were taller and or if the light source were lower the shadow would be longer or if the nail were shorter and or the light source was higher the shadow would be smaller now these three measures the nails height the lights position and the shadows length are all related mathematically such that if you gave me only two of them I could figure out the third always so I could declare this relationship to be a law but that does not mean that the law causes them to all have the measure that they do for example if you ask me hey um why is the nail six centimeters tall what causes the nail to have that height well if I said well the nails height is caused by the shadows lengthen the lights position youd be like as if alright I mean sure we can figure out the nails height by knowing about the shadow and the light but that does not mean that they are causing the nail to have the height that it does to know why the nail is six centimeters tall wed have to ask whoever manufactured it or whoever sets nail standards or whatever the point here is that we should not confuse relationships laws with causes explanations that involve the causal reasons for things are often better but what is an explanation well thats easy to answer explanations help us understand things but what does it mean to understand does it mean to not stand up fully or does it mean to stand underneath and to look at from below if I can understand something can I also over stand something well as it turns out the under in understand does not mean beneath or below instead it means inside to stand surrounded by to be a part of now this sense of under is quite common for example when you say ah well under those circumstances you dont mean well when those circumstances are overhead and Im under them instead you mean if I find myself in those circumstances and that is how under is used in understand to understand something is to stand in the midst of it to be part of it and to be within it and that is helpful to keep in mind I cannot walk into something thats crumpled up and closed off to truly understand something it needs to be opened up for me unfolded and that is what an explanation should do the word explain literally means to flatten plain out X explain to make flat now if youll excuse the analogy if this is a story I want to read and its all crumpled up a physical law basically just tells me a summary of the story itll tell me how the story ends what language and grammatical rules were used to write it but an explanation will flatten the page out and allow me to see the details an actual word and the word that follows it and so on all the way through so lets unfold the phenomenon of me speeding up my rotation when I pull the books in and find a physical mechanical cause for that increased rotation I have here two different circular motion paths around the center of rotation which well call C now when a particle is traveling in this outer ring and is suddenly pulled in it doesnt stop moving around and suddenly just go right in instead it takes a bit of a curved path like this now this is really interesting because in order for a particle to be in circular motion it must have two things it must have put the particle there it must have a velocity that is tangential to the path but it must also have a centripetal force a center seeking force that always points towards the center of rotation now notice that these two arrows are at a right angle to each other so the centripetal force is not speeding up or slowing down the particle its just changing its direction constantly tada circular motion however when the particle is pulled in and it follows this curved path to this inner orbit its instantaneous velocity is no longer perpendicular to the centripetal force its tangential velocity tangent to that curve is going to look something like this but notice that now the centripetal force is no longer at a right angle the force that is changing that particles Direction is no longer at a right angle to its velocity instead if this is the normal to its velocity the centripetal is pulling the particle forward ahead in its rotation speeding up its rotational velocity so as you can see I speed up when I pull the books in because when I accelerate the books towards myself Im not just accelerating them towards myself Im also accelerating them around now likewise if a particle were to be pushed out from an orbit like this into a larger orbit its gonna not you know its not gonna do this its not gonna go up time to go here one straight line no its gonna go like this okay Ill go to the larger orbit but look now on this line the particles instantaneous velocity is something like this and the centripetal force is not perpendicular to that line this is let me give that a little V oh yeah nice labeling all right so oh wait now you can see it whoops all right so this is the one were talking about though this is the one that matters all right so the the the normal to that velocity might be like this so now notice that the centripetal force is actually working against the velocity of the particle decelerating it so of course it slows down when I move the books further out my rotation slows down because moving them out is also decelerating them now this is why it is harder to pull your arms in when youre spinning than when youre not because youre not just moving your arms into yourself youre also accelerating them in the direction of their rotation not only is the magnitude of angular momentum conserved so is the direction but what is the direction of something spin what seems easy enough right look at this whats the direction of its spin clockwise or is it someone standing on the other side would say that it was traveling counterclockwise Oh interestingly this means that if you were to ask the face of a clock which way its hands spun it would say counterclockwise of course in order to unambiguously differentiate the direction of rotation we need a tool that has no axis of symmetry in any of the three spatial dimensions of our universe and luckily Ive got a tool just like that in here Ive been keeping it fresh and OH because a sworn I oh there it is its my right hand a human hand is asymmetrical in the X Y  Z directions weve got thumb no thumb wrist fingertips palm knuckles now because of this property if we orient two pairs of opposite sides in a particular way the one remaining pair will be locked now my fingers can only really curl in the palm direction on the palm side so if I have my fingertips in the direction of a wheelspin curled such that an object on that spinning object travels from my wrist around to my fingertips well then my thumb will only point in one direction no matter which side Im on from behind this is now going clockwise but the right hand rule still puts my thumb backwards thats very cool we call the direction that the righthand thumb is pointing the direction of the wheels angular momentum but we could also use the left hand wed get opposite directions than the right hand gives us but so long as we all agree to use the same hand we will always be on the same page but as it turns out of course the right hand was chosen and so determining the direction of angular momentum and velocity is called the use of the right hand rule okay so now that we know how to find the direction of angular momentum we could explore how that part of it is also conserved I have here a very special wheel oh yeah its pretty crazy looking thats because I wanted it to be really massive so I wrap Im not sure its really that safe but oh man is the effect good all right now lets say that I gotta you have my right hand free lets say that I start spinning the wheel like this the direction of its angular momentum can be found using the righthand rule I curl my fingers in the direction of rotation so thats something on the wheel is going from my wrist to my fingertips and I look at which way my thumb is point it was pointing up lets call up the positive direction I dont know the magnitude of the angular momentum of the wheel right now its some number but lets just call it L and since its up well call it positive I could call it negative all that matters is that I can differentiate one direction from the opposite all right wonderful so notice that if I spun the wheel this way Id have to turn my right hand over to curl my fingers properly now my thumb is pointing down so this would be negative lets call the magnitude of this wheels angular momentum L positive L well if I got the wheel spinning so that it had an angular momentum of positive L if I then turn it upside down its angular momentum will have changed direction it would have swapped from being positive L to negative L however if nothing else is interfering that cant happen without angular momentum being conserved so what plus negative L is positive L our original well positive 2l and that is what we will see happen if I spin this wheel like this such that it has an angular momentum of positive L and then I turn it upside down something else will have to have an angular momentum of positive 2 L so like imagine my thumb being twice as long what is that something else well itll be me in the chair is this very cool so lets make sure we know whats about to happen Im gonna spin the wheel this way then Im going to turn it upside down and so Im going to see myself in the chair wind up rotating this way Ill rotate that way all right so what Im gonna do is have Scott step in and give this wheel a nice healthy spin in that direction so it has an angular momentum of positive L Ill take my foot off the ground when hes done so Im in more or less isolated system and Ill turn the wheel upside down and I should go that way whoa angular momentum is conserved thats pretty cool but the conservation of angular momentum either its magnitude or or its direction is not Y turning the wheel upside down spun me this way website kicked my empty to cup a container anyway what caused me to move well if you do this yourself you will feel the handles of the wheel literally pushing you put in a torque on your body and it has everything to do with that concept I have covered in my spinning video and my video ending about Eulers disk if the wheel isnt spinning and I push it down right here itll tilt like that right not very surprising thats the kind of tilt we would expect but when the wheel is spinning all the piece of matter out here well they all have some velocity before I hit them for example when a piece of matter on the wheel is out here its moving backwards and when I push it down it doesnt suddenly stop moving backwards the wheel doesnt stop instead the pieces Im pushing are now going to go backwards as they already were and down so they go backwards and down and then they come back up and the entire wheel is found to tilt this way look towards me 90 degrees ahead from where I actually pushed it down a push down here causes the wheel to move like this a push down here would cause the wheel to tilt like this a push up here would cause the wheel to tilt like lets see 90 degrees ahead in the rotation like this and this and this is exactly what Im doing when I turn the wheel upside down so when I put a torque on the wheel to turn it while its spinning like this the wheel actually turns this way but I have two hands holding it my left hand lines up getting pushed backwards and my right hand pulled forwards that puts a torque on my body which causes me being pushed back here and pulled forward here it causes me to be turned and so I turn this way the way that we saw in the demo in the and that is the physical origin of the phenomenon we just witnessed the key point here is that nothing you have seen happen today happened because of the conservation of angular momentum physical laws dont cause anything to happen but plenty of things are demonstrations of their truth now dont get me wrong I love physical laws they truly do represent a conquering of mystery when we find a way to project definite numbers onto reality and make predictions thats amazing but not coupled with causal mechanical physical explanations their generality can come across like magic now magic is fun for sure but congruences between mathematics and reality oh thats a sweet nectar in mathematics we get to make the rules pick the axioms we can even decide what kinds of reasoning are allowed or not and after doing so we get to play around and see what happens mathematics is the plane of games science is finding out what game youre playing and we still dont know what game we have found ourselves in but we should keep wondering and never be happy until we get answers that satisfy us stay curious and as always thanks for watching Music I have some pretty exciting news to share with you as of today

Mind Reading,2019-01-16T17:00:03Z,22.366666666666667,8231865,0,Mind reading Of course not I love reading Look mind reading might soundlike pseudoscientific pardon my language bullshoot But its scientific counterpartthought identification is very much a real thing Its based in neuroimagingand machine learning and whats really cool isthat experiments in mind reading arent just about spyingon what someone is thinking Theyre about figuring outwhat thoughts are even made of I mean when I thinkof something what does that mental pictureactually look like What resolution is it in How high fidelityis a memory and how do they changeover time Well in this episode Im going to look at howreading peoples minds can help us answerthese questions My journey begins right hereat the University of Oregon Im meeting with Dr Brice Kuhlfrom the Kuhl lab Hes a neuroscientistwho uses neuroimaging and machine learning to figureout what people are thinking without them telling him So tell me whatyoure doing here Well Im in the cognitiveneuroscience program here and I study human memory My lab primarily usesneuroimaging methods so we do a lot of work using functional magneticresonance imaging or fMRI And how do you usefMRI to investigate memories Were looking at the patternof neural activity When you form a memorytheres a certain pattern And we can recordthat pattern and then test whetherthat pattern is reinstated or reactivated at a later pointlike when youre remembering it Does that mean we can look atthe patterns of brain activity and deduce what it is that isbeing remembered or recalled or even just thought Yes and so we call thatdecoding So it basically takesyour input pattern as some pattern of activitythat we record while youre rememberingsomething And we make a predictionabout what youre remembering You can see how this soundslike mind reading laughsYes It sounds like that So Brice what are you goingto do to me today So what were goingto be doing today is uncharted territoryfor us So were going to be trying outa kind of new variant of the experiment on you So I cant guaranteeany particular results But it representswhere the field is and wherewere trying to go Today youre going toparticipate in an experiment where youll be studying faces So were goingto have you study 12 pictures of celebrities People I already amfamiliar with People that you know yeahOkay And youre going to tryto remember those pictures Then were going to have you gointo the MRI scanner Try to bring that pictureto mind as vividly as possible And were going to be recordingyour brain activity as you try to imaginethese pictures Were going to tryto build the face Essentially draw a picture ofwhat youre remembering A pictureA picture An actual picturethat we can print out and I could likehang on my wall laughsIf you wanted Michael The first step is for me to memorize  the 12 specific celebrity photographs  Brice will later try to detect me thinking about  I sat down to do this graduate student Max  The success of his predictions depend in part  on my ability to recall these faces  as vividly as possible while inside the fMRI All right so sighs I think I have a pretty goodmemory of all of those GreatI feel the stakes are high  With the celebrity faces hopefully memorized  its time for the next step  going through the metal detector  and into the fMRI  where Brice will record and monitor my brain activity and then later feed it into hisalgorithm to rebuild the faces  This will be the first time hes attempted  to reconstruct faces from longterm memory  which is very difficult because were relying  on how clearly I can remember the celebrity photos  I saw an hour ago I love its eyesLook at that woman Wouldnt the kid be likeIts going to eat me  An fMRI monitors the activity within the brain  by dividing it up into thousands of small cubes  called voxels or volumetric pixels  Each of these voxels contains  hundreds of thousands of neurons  Using fMRI we are able to detect  blood flow within these voxels  which means that that part of the brain is active  If Im shown several pictures of people with mustaches  my brain will react to the features for each face  But there will be a common area of my brain  that is engaged throughout  That may be the area of mybrain that reacts to mustaches  So later when I imagine a face  if Brice notices that area is engaged  he can predict that I am thinking  about a mustache So right now Michaelsin the scanner and hes seeing words appearon the screen one at a time and hes tryingto visualize the face remember the face in as muchdetail as possible What you can see here arethe images that were acquiring We get one of thesebrain volumes every two seconds So these are refreshing in realtime as we collect the images Michael With part one of the fMRI session over  its time for part two where Brice and his team  will learn the language of my brain activity  so they can later decode by brain scans Hi MichaelYou doing okay still MichaelYup  Theyll show me hundreds of unique faces  and record how my brain reacts  to certain facial characteristics  They will then use this information  to reconstruct the celebrity faces  I thought about during the first phase of the scan Really the more faces thatwe can show Michael the better So were going to basically keephim in there as long as hes comfortable Michael Two hours was the maximum time  we could get in the fMRI  But I was able to look at over 400 faces  which should be enough to get  some pretty interesting results Hey Michael you did itThat was great Were going to comeget you out MichaelAll right Yeah so these just showsome of the pictures that we were takingwhile you were in there Some images of your brain Now we are goingto crunch some numbers Max is going to analyzeyour data Well meet upagain tomorrow where well lookat the results where we try to actuallyreconstruct the face images from the brain datathat we just collected All rightWell see you tomorrow All rightThanks a lot Max thank you as wellI cant wait You better pullan allnighter I want this datato be perfect All right so I am backat Dr Kuhls lab Overnight his teamcrunched the data and I cant wait to see whatthey think they saw me thinking How are my results I think they look good Were going to take a lookin just a moment here All rightI cant wait So can I just take a seatYeah have a seat All right so first of all what am I seeingOh okay well these are the picturesI actually memorized Thats rightAnd this is what youve reconstructedfrom my imagination Thats rightOh wow Okay BriceOkay so this is oneof the reconstructions that was generated MichaelInteresting MaxSo thats John Cho MichaelNot bad Not bad Can we see the side by sideYeah MichaelI see you know similarities in the kind of facialexpressions in general You know you could almostsee the hairline matching here The shape of the faceI also thought was It kind of hada square shape to it Yes YesSo those are the things that came out to me And so when I wasvisualizing this image of John Cho the squareness of the face wasthe first most salient thing I just kept thinkinghe was the square guy Excellent all right BriceSo thats Megan Fox MichaelMmhmm Youre going to show us theside by side MichaelThe side by side Right BriceYou can see the pictureyou actually saw and thats the reconstructionwe generated Ill you thisMegan Fox I was not able to have a really clear picturein my mind For some reason this imageof her was really hard for me to bring back into my mind The sternness in the face wassomething that I did pick up on So I did sense that there wasIt looked feminine And you picked upon the sternness And so togetherthat produces a match Michael Keep in mind that Brice and his team  have read these from my memory  But when I remember a face  do I picture every detail simultaneously  with photographic accuracy  Or do I just attend to a few at a time  By reading my mind they may be seeing  how bad my memory is and how it works Me MeBrice laughs Okay so that is yourreconstruction of me thinking aboutthis image of myself BriceThats right Whered the beard go Brice I dont knowI was hoping you could tell me MichaelFor instance this is a picture of me remembering my own face It really doesnt look like me but the question is  how good am I at picturing myself  I dont think of my own face that often  so the strangeness in the result  may be as much about flaws in my own memory  and mental picture of myself as flaws in the technology So thats Jennifer LawrenceI believe MichaelThats Jennifer Lawrence It looks like its JenniferLawrences much older uncle all chuckle Nothing here was toomindblowingly close But this is something thatyoure just starting out trying these sort of longtermmemories  What Brice and his team read in my mind  might have been more accurate if theyd shown me thousands  rather than hundreds of images in the fMRI  because then the algorithm would have learned  the language of my brain more thoroughly  But regardless the quality of my memories  would have still been an issue  I mean look what happens when memory  is cut out of the equation entirely  Brice also read my brain activity  when I was looking at faces in the fMRI  not just imagining them  And those results were much closer  than those reconstructed from my memory Okay so what am I looking atright here BriceOkay so what youre seeing here in the top rowthese are images that you saw while you were in the scanner Below that in this bottom rowthese are the reconstructions that we draw from the patternsof brain activity we collected This is from the source imageRight MichaelThese are from my brain Brice RightMichael Theyre pretty close Yeah overall they werepretty close So not perfect These are you can see theressome variability in these But this is consistentwith what weve found before that the reconstructionsthat we generated when youre viewingthe faces there is some correspondencebetween the actual face So this is kind ofa sanity check that we can actuallyreconstruct the images when youre viewing themRight right Theyre pretty good Well Brice Maxthank you so much for letting mebe a part of this I hope my datas useful Thank youIts been a lot of fun Its always useful for usto think about these things Dr Brice Kuhls memory researchis showing that its possible for a computerto read someones mind To figure outwhat theyre thinking But a lot of progressstill needs to be made I mean if you want to know what Im thinking right nowfor example its still easier to just ask meto tell you But what if I canttell you Dr Yukiyasu Kamitaniis a researcher professor and pioneerexploring the frontier behind the wall of sleep Ive come hereto Kyoto University to meet with him and to seewhat its like to read not what someoneis thinking but what someoneis dreaming Kamitani senseiIm Michael Hi Im YukiYuki nice to meet you Michael For the last ten years  Dr Kamitani has been at the forefront  of machine mind reading The subject is you knowready to go in  Similar to Brice Kuhl  his early experiments explored reconstructing images  shown to subjects in an fMRI based on their brain activity  In Kamitanis case  the images were blackandwhite shapes  and the reconstructions were strikingly accurate  Recently Kamitani has focused on using deep neural networks  and machine learning  to decipher subjects brain activity  while they view much more complex photographs  What youre seeing is theresult of a deep neural network  processing the brain activity of a subject  looking at the photograph  This could have myriad applications in the future  for example in criminal investigations  and interpersonal communication KamitaniThis is far from perfect But I think you still see someyou know eyes and you know MichaelWell yeah And colors too KamitaniYeah to some extent yeah His most current work however is about the subconscious  Hes attempting something extremely ambitious  recording our dreams Would you call yourselfa sleep researcher or a vision researcher Maybe a brain decoder A brain decoder Thats a pretty cooljob description Can you show me anything fromwhat youre doing with dreams KamitaniMmhmm yeah  Dr Kamitanis work on dream decoding  begins with a similar process to Dr Kuhls  showing the test subject thousands of images  while they are in an fMRI  in order to learn what the brain looks like  when it is thinking of certain things  Once the machinelearning algorithm is pretty good  at identifying what images the subject is thinking about  the subject is placed in an fMRI  with an EEG cap on their head  and invited to fall asleep  When the EEG waves indicate that the person is dreaming  the algorithm predicts which kinds of things  the subject is most likely dreaming about  Right now the algorithm looks for 20 categories  Things like buildings transportation  and characters in a language  Researchers then awaken the subject  ask them what they were dreaming about  and see if the algorithms prediction  and the persons recollection match  Here is actual data from one of Kamitanis experiments  Below is a word cloud of categories  The name of each category get bigger or smaller  in real time based on the probability  that they are presentin the subjects current dream  Now as you can seeactivity is currently strongest  for the category character meaning written language  At this point the subject was awoken  and this is what they reported Thats pretty spooky laughsRight I mean you you spied on their dream Yeah in a wayBut the accuracysnot that great so Well the accuracysnot that great but you know my normal accuracy for guessingpeoples dreams is zero Right  While continuing his research  into predicting the content of dreams  Dr Kamitani is embarking on his newest project  actually reconstructing images from our dreams So youve broughtsome of the reconstructions that your lab has created Mmhmm of dreams Right they all look like dreamsabout blobs KamitaniYeah I mean I want to justtake a step back and appreciate that what werelooking at on this screen are in a way some of the firstphotographs of a dream Mmhmm  We are looking at the earliest phase  of revolutionary research  One day we may able to have images  or even record movies of our own dreams  And Dr Kamitani is the only person in the world  doing this so far Hes a lone explorer journeying into our subconscious So this work hasnt evenbeen published yet No Thank you for showing it to melaughs The insights that researcherslike Dr Kuhl and Dr Kamitani might be capable of achievingin the future because of mind reading are difficultto fully fathom But lets slow downfor a second because were talkingabout a technology that can know usbetter than we know ourselves Should we reallybe doing this Well to addressthat question Im going to meetwith an expert in ethics neuroscienceand artificial intelligence Julia Bossmann Shes the director of strategyat Fathom Computing a council memberof the World Economic Forum an alum of Ray KurzweilsSingularity University and a former presidentof the Foresight Institute a think tank specializingin future technologies and their impacts Julia thanks for taking sometime to chat Yeah of courseYou are the perfect person for me to bringthese questions to MmhmmAnd theyre deep questions But I think theyreextremely important and theyre becomingmore and more pressing I think were living in suchan interesting time right now because were in this timewhere brains and machines are actually movingcloser together So when it comesto being able to look at brain activity where arethe ethical lines here How private shouldmy internal thoughts be Like with any powerfultechnology it depends on the handsthat wield it All these new technologies are things that can make whoeveruses them more powerful So we want to not blamethe technology but we want to how is it being used and who is using it So how do we make surethat this technology is in the right hands So I think its very importantto involve people who act on policy and law to understand what is comingin the future I am hopeful aboutthe collaborative aspect of it Lets talk aboutthe good things now I mean what arethe applications here Yeah so if we think about the late Stephen Hawkingfor example if he had a way of richerinterfacing with the world or with computerswe can only imagine what he could haveshared with us Those with lockedin syndromeright They are thereThey know that they are there But we just need somethingto look into their brain to see what it isthat they are trying to say or what theyre feelingRight exactly So what do you sayto people that have that kind of fearof technology of us surrendering our truenatural selves to technology There is something enticingabout getting to the next level of what some people might calla human evolution or civilization developmentand so on In a way we are already notliving natural lives right Because then most of us woulddie before the age of I dont know 30 or 40 We would have all kindsof diseases We would not wearthis clothing We wouldnt have eyeglassesor contact lenses We wouldnt have antibiotics JuliaWe are already kind of very futuristic cyborgsif we compare ourselves to the human that was living10000 years ago and was geneticallyalmost identical with who we are now MichaelYeah we really are In order to understandcognition right now we basically haveto either just ask people to talk aboutwhat theyre thinking or observe their behavior But reading thoughts directlywould be a lot better That is how Dr Kuhlis studying memory and its how Dr Kamitaniis studying sleep and dreams But even though the technologyhas a long way to go its easy to seehow ethical questions could become an issue Well heres the thing there is no such thingas a totally wild human We are coevolvingwith technology Humans and technology todayare inseparable Now its true that we needto be careful about every new thing we do but we cannot change the factthat they will happen Its a story weve lived throughagain and again You know we could havesat around forever debating whether or nota speed limit should exist and who should havethe authority to enforce it But we didnt Instead we went aheadand invented cars and responsibly figured outthe details as we went along Ethical questionsabout new technologies do the most good whenthey facilitate the technology not when they needlesslyhinder progress So follow your dreams And as soon as you canshow them to me And as alwaysthanks for

Behavior and Belief,2019-01-09T17:00:02Z,28.45,2819987,0,Hey Mind Field Vanessa here Just kidding My nameis actually Michael That part when I saidthat I was Vanessa that was a lie So youre welcome Humans love lies More precisely we love thingsthat arent entirely true because we have to Its often all we have Completely proving somethingcan be difficult if not impossible So instead we havethe faith of the believer the confidence intervalof the scientist What we think we know we really only believe we know On this episode of Mind Field Im going to take a look at a kind of liewe tell ourselves And Im going to use beliefto turn a lieinto a truth   theme music playing  Michael If Im going to harness  the power of belief  I need to find a good way to study belief and behavior  So Im paying a visit to UCLAs Dr Aaron Blaisdell  who I worked with on last seasons  Greater Good Trolley Problem episode   train whistle blowing  Dr Blaisdellgreat to see you again Nice to see you againMichael Thank you for your helplast season but Ive got this new thingI want to look into I started thinking a lotabout belief and how we form them Specifically beliefs aboutwhat causes our behavior I want to be ableto break it down and just look at how peoplerespond to the environmentaround them and how it changestheir belief Well a Skinner Boxis a great place to start because whatI tell my students is a Skinner Boxfor a psychologistlike myself is like a test tubefor a chemist  Dr Skinner what are you doing with this pigeon  Im getting ready to demonstrate a fundamental principle of behavior Michael Invented by Harvard psychologist BF Skinner  a Skinner Box is a chamber in which animals  can be isolated and exposed to carefully controlled stimuli  In one of his landmark experiments  Skinner released food to pigeons in the boxes  at regular intervals  What he found was that the pigeons seemed to believe  that whatever they happened to be doing  just before the food came  actually caused the food to appear  and would then repeat that behavior over and over  for example hopping around or spinning in circles  Skinner called this superstitious behavior So what do you want to dowhats your dream test Basically a replicationof Skinners superstitiousexperiment but instead of with pigeonswith people I would love to seewill people develop their own sort ofsuperstitious ritualsor beliefs Have we done thiswith people before I dont thinksuch a rigorous testof this has been done I think primarily fromthe literature I knowits pretty much pigeons BF Skinners workshowed that if you regularly delivera reward to a pigeon regardless of howit actually acts the pigeon wontfigure that out Instead the pigeon will developsuperstitious behaviors as if it thinksit is in control despite the lack ofany evidence that it is  But what about humans  Watching people form new superstitions  might show us how beliefs are created but heres the thing You cant just put a personin a Skinner Box People are quite cleverand so instead along with Dr Aaron Blaisdell I have developeda much more elaborate ruse Welcome to Victory Vault  ♪ Michael Victory Vault is a fake game show we made up  to draw our unsuspecting subjects  into taking part in a human Skinner Box  To accomplish this we rented a sound stage  and constructed what appeared to be a game show set  but was really our study  We outfitted the room with a checkboard floor  a button that serves no purpose  multiple cameras and a live microphone  all of which have absolutely no connection to winning the game  We also included an ATM slot on the wall where instead of food  dollar bills would be fed into the room  at regular intervals  Meanwhile I would be playing the role  of the executive producer of this new game show  testing out the concept for a television network  Our first subject is Rebecca Yes I know nothingIm excited Excellent excellent Well Ill you some thingsthat you need to know One you will get to keepall of the moneythat you get today The object of the gameis to collect as much moneyas possible  OK  laughs  Now you will have ten minutes and  thats allIm going to tell you  Go OK OK  Rebecca OK Michael over loudspeaker  All right Rebecca begin in three two one go  Blaisdell Of course right to the button but shes not fixated on it shes definitelylooking around there Rebecca Im tryingto figure out if theres like a puzzleor what this is about Am I supposed to just get out No not supposed to get out OK Oh OK theres moneyIs that one clue Rebecca Ive earned one dollar  laughs  See Shes earned one dollarEarned I mean she thinks shecaused it to happen Lets see I thinkI might be onto something  with this door maybe  Uhhuh  OK Blaisdell  The second dollar bill came out really shortlyafter she manipulated the door Thats what Skinner would calladventitious reinforcement She accidentally justhappened to be doing something  and now look  Hello  Look it reinforced thatbehavior  look how strong itsbecome Now shes doing a lotwith the door  and this dancing just like one of Skinners pigeons  Anything See Michael For the first two minutes  Rebecca believed a specific combination  of the door and the button  were triggering the money  She had created a superstitious ritual  But when her old ritual ceased to line up with the reward being delivered  she started exploring new actions Would you like to keepsending money Is it something with thisHello dollar bill Michael This change in Rebeccas behavior  indicates that she stopped believing that pressing the button  is associated with money coming out  Skinner called this extinction  singing ♪ Keep sending moneywhat if I dance ♪ Michael Not it seems she believes  her new actions might connect to the reward  Five four three  Rebecca yelps   two one  Lets try coming out again  zero stop  And OK I dont think I solvedthis mystery  laughs  Michael RebeccaYou got some money huh  I did Come take a seat So first of allhowd it go Oh Very confusing I wasnt able tofully figure it out but it was something to dowith the 20 white squareson the floor Something to do withthe red button as welllike a pattern maybe Oh Maybe I should have triedclicking on the button20 times  Yes OK you wanna know what makes the money come out Yes Its probablysomething really crazy  Its just 30 seconds passing Blaissdell Yep  It has nothing to do with what you do Ohh You would have gottenthe same amount but you could just saton the floor and done nothing   laughing  Yeah This is actuallya psychological experiment based on some work doneby BF Skinner and we are looking atthe kinds of behaviorspeople invent that they thinkcontrols the money  But I think this was fascinating Blaisdell Yeah  And you really do get to keep the money Yay  Rebecca thank you for your help today Cool Thank you guys Michael Rebeccas rituals seemed to indicate  that she thought performing for the camera  would work the best  Her beliefs about TV shows informed  the kinds of superstitions she would create  But will other people develop the same superstitions  Or will it depend on the beliefs and expectations they already have The object of Victory Vault is to collect as much moneyas you can Oh OK Well let me takethese accessories off therereally quickly As soon as that door closesyour ten minutes starts I dont get to ask questions Not on Victory Vault MichaelSee you in ten minutes All right Wheres the cash Its like an escape room Am I supposed to push this Blaisdell Some people really wanted instructions Michael Yeah Contestant I feel like if I push this the time is gonna be up Michael Like Rebecca all of our subjects  immediately gravitated to the useless button That button is so salient Push the button Oh shit   Michael Blaisdell laugh  He was a little surprisedat that Push the button Oh OK I think I get itIs it push the button Will I push the buttonAm I supposed topush the button  rapping  ♪ If youre gonpush the button then youregoin with the button ♪ ♪ And Im pushinon the button ♪ Michael It was clear that most of the superstitions  began with the button but evolved into something else  very quickly including this guy  whose superstitious behavior  was doing absolutely nothing  Blaisdell Hes just standing there  Michael Yeah Will he do something  chuckling  Maybe taking the moneyisbad I know strippers get singlesfor dancing  Blaisdell Is he gonna dance I hope he doesnt strip for us I cant dance like that Maybe I can sweet talkthe machine Its just giving me moneyat this point Im not doing anything laughs   Blaisdell  Hes no fool Hes not really showingmuch superstitious behavior  Even in Skinners experiments  not all the pigeons showed superstitious behaviors  Michael Obviously theres a game I called it a game show  But the moneys just piling up like its contagious  Oh look  Uh Oh  He really doesnt want to push it Come onPress it four timesout comes the money  Press it four times Out comes the money   contestant laughing  Press it four timesout comes the money She believes thatpressing the buttonis necessary is a cause  And the ritual consists of a few actions strung together  Five four three  twoone stop Can I push the button  Time is up  Damn Stay where you areWe will see you very soon I feel like I wassupposed to push the button Michael Pigeons dont enter a Skinner Box  with nearly as many preconceived notions as humans do  Humans come in with a rich diversity of expectations  Some think they need to perform for the camera or make the producers laugh  This guy thought that the secret was to just be different Hold it Oh I thought Take a seat  What was that Michael  Great work What made the money come out This is what I finally thought It was a testnot to push the button and then as I kept sayinga cer a word like phrase and buttonit kept coming out But I didnt know howit was supposed to be phrased Hit that buttonHit it a lot As if your lifedepended on it I was thinkingWhat would people not do  Hmm Probably just stand there So I was like welllets just stand thereand see what happens Maybe theyll reward patienceover impulsiveness  You started doing exercises Man Yeah I dont know if it rewarded you for just beingdoing crazy things Did you learn anything That it was dispensinglike a dollar every I dont knowlike 30 secondsor something Youre right You had no controlover when the moneycame out Its pretty interestingIm wondering  if thats because of who you are Yep  WhWho are you Blaisdell Elaborate Thats just like my thoughtprocess I think like Im just very observant You came up with this great enteringandexitingtheroomthing Tell me about that Because the moneydidnt start coming out until after II waited I waited I waited and nothing came outuntil after I leftand came back in You shoulda justleft me in thereto get more money You made a sistahwork hard for her money Michael  Victory Vault aka humanSkinner Box experiment What are your thoughts Were really findingthat humans are susceptible to superstitiousbeliefs or behaviors You know whatI totally agree Except there were some peoplewho were able to guess with some degree of confidencethat they didnt have control Some people were probablyjust skeptical from thegetgo  Yeah And thats justtheir personality Yeah the beliefsthat people broughtinto that room really affectedwhat beliefs or lack thereof  they created in the roomonce the game started Yeah  Were belief machinesWere pattern seekers And theres evena belief that in psychologyand in anthropology that may be the waya lot of rituals got startedby accidental reinforcement And then it becomescodified into a religionor a cultural practice Hmm  ♪ Our humansized Skinner Box showed that when confrontedwith uncertainty people often behavedsuperstitiously under the beliefthat they do have control But of coursenothing anyone didin that box would make the moneycome out any faster So those superstitionswere lies But sometimesif a lie is believed in enough it can literally become true like a placebo Now Ive been watching a lot of horror movies lately and they gave me an idea If Im able to find justthe right preexisting beliefs to wrap around a placebo could I literallymake people believe that I am possessing themwith a spirit I want to performa sham reverse exorcism  Exorcisms are not some Hollywood fabrication  and they didnt only happen hundreds of years ago  In fact in the United States alone  there are currently 50 priests  endorsed by the Vaticans International Association of Exorcists  up from just 12 a decade ago  But whats a reverse exorcism  Its something I made up  where instead of removing a spirit from someone  you put one in them  I want to do that because I dont think its ethical  to tell someone theyre possessed by a demon But Ill need some help and I know just who to ask Michael Dr Veissiére thank you I had a blast last season I think that the work we didand the things you showed me related to ourpowerofsuggestion worktogether on placebos was so powerful Well Michaelits a real pleasure Im honoredto be here again It also is why yourethe person I thought of for what I want to do next Building on the workwe did last season I want to explore belief and what I canand cannot control I want to perform an accessoryassisted reverse exorcism  Hmm Reverse exorcism because Im not gonna tell youthat you have a demon in you or something in youthat Im gonna removeyoure fine What I can do is make you feellike youre losing control You would like toexperimentally induce a spirit possession experience  Right I like that All rightlets talk details here Are there things we can doto increase the effectiveness of our reverse exorcism ritual Yeah Im thinkingwe could probably usesome tricks from hypnosis If we went themto have experiences we need to suggestthose experiencesto them specifically We would be using a lot of propsfrom both religion and science to get peoplescritical mindsto relax and then we will throw insome suggestions So weve gotreligious iconography and weve got the paraphernaliaof medical science Lets do this Michael Almost everyone feels a certain way  in the presence of medical equipment  and even though not everyone observes the same religion  Swiss psychologist Carl Jung posited that a persons  belief in a religious symbol  wasnt necessary for it to exert an influence on them  Consciously they may say it doesnt but unconsciously it will  With Dr Veissiére onboard  I had Mind Fields art department  mock up our lab with plenty of scientific  and religious iconography  ♪ Michael With our lab dressed to Veissiéres specs  everything is in place for our reverse exorcism  Our five test subjects  prescreened and vetted by a psychologist  arrived at the facility thinking that they were going to take part  in a broad study on the science of religion  Immediately we exposed them to things  that would convince them of the seriousness  of what they were about to do  such as filling out extensive paperwork  woman making announcement  Michael And an extended period of time in the waiting room  to increase anticipation and tension  We even used a fake participant  to talk up his amazing experience  in earshot of the real subjects  Woman Hi Hi  How was it That was crazy  Yeah That was something else Michael And to really sell the illusion  we used multiple actors like a fake receptionist  a nurse to check the patients vitals  and a pretend priest to add credibility  to the religious angle  Dr Veissiére played the role of a scientist  fascinated by the power of the ritual  This should influence our participants  because how could this all not be real  if a guy in a white lab coat is taking it so seriously So we are just aboutready to begin  Now Im watching hidden cameras that we have  in the exam room adjacent to us Lets see what sorts ofaltered states of consciousnesswe can create today  Now this is Jeremiah and Jeremiahs been waiting for about an hour ActorNurse So Im gonna be placing this on your head Its called an EEG capit just measures  your brain activity This is a really important partof selling the scientific realnessof what were doing Jeremiahvery pleased to meet you Thank you so much for coming  Thank you so much again for your patience I think its really importantfor Veissiére to talk about how whats about to happenis special its not a normal ritual In fact its not a ritualthat any lay people reallyknow about yet So the name of the studyits a bit of a mouthful so were looking atneural correlatesand physiologic markers of ritually inducedmystical experiences  I have run this experiment about 30 times and some people enter  some kind of encounter with  what they may call a divine presence  Jeremiah Hows it goin Michael Here comes  the priest  Im Jeremiah Nice to meetyou sir  Father Callahan Father Callahanthe Stephen King character OK we mighthave to change that ActorPriest Jeremiah what Id like you to do is relax and Id like youjust to casually stare at the crucifixin the center Michael We had our priest guide Jeremiah  through a holy ritual  which we told him was a thousand years old  But in actuality Dr Veissiére wrote it himself  just before the demonstration  ActorPriest And you may feel a tendency  that you want to let your hands raise towards the skyas your body falls away Michael Getting someone to literally act possessed  is definitely a difficult test of the placebo effect  so Im not exactly sure what kind of results we can expect  However Im at least hoping that we learn from this  how to better tap into the power of peoples beliefs  ActorPriest Whatever the spirit needs to speak it will speak So now as you keep relaxingas the spirit prepares  Jeremiah sat very still during the whole ritual  but we were curious about what he experienced So whatdid that feel like Jeremiah  It was weird  but I could feel like the presence its a little graphic if some likecut my head off  I didnt feel anything below  Right Michael People dont normally have feelings  of decapitation and numbness  so either weve stumbled upon a way to summon a spirit  or our belief manipulation is working So weve been working togetheron this project and I was observing youfrom the other room And there are tworeally powerfulkinds of symbols in the room Which one had the biggestkind of visceral effect on you I guess it was kind ofa balance because like OK its religiousand the nurse comin in science it kindagoes back and forthso I want to say even Well more has been going onthan what you knowat this moment JoeFather Callahanwas not a priest  Mmhmm Hes an actor and everything that he readwas written by Dr Veissiére Were looking at howa thing that has noknown causal link to any particular reactionor behavior or feeling can nonethelessinduce a feeling Michael Jeremiahs experience was pretty curious  and since nothing too serious happened his head didnt spin around  we felt more comfortable pushing things a bit further Im the leadbehavioral scientistin charge of the experiment this is my colleagueDr Stevens Michael First I interacted with the participants  before the ritual to build up their expectation  of something happening likepossession So today you will belistening to a reverse exorcism  OK Im already possessed Im already possessed Michael We also decided to dim the lights  to decrease their inhibitions and increase the atmosphere  Michael I think its gonna be great for our participants and for the whole mood I mean its spooky stuff Before you can fullyexperience the divine Ill simply just invite youto kind of relax Michael And we decided to have Dr Veissiére  lead the ritual instead of our priest  so that he could use  his training in behavioral psychology  to harness the power of suggestion  The priest continued to serve  as an important religious anchor point  for the subject to focus on Veissiére All of youractions and reactions gradually fade and disappear as your body is nowapproaching the divine You may notice your fingers tingling a little You may feel your mouthneeding to tweak a little Her mouth is openingslowly As the divine tries to speak through you  filling your mouth perhaps gently ever so slowly You are now awake Good Michael When the ritual ended  each of our participants had something very interesting to report He did definitelyhave an aura around him the Father Woman I could feel just this everlasting joyand peace of Godjust covering me There was likea glowing figure man and then the crosswas like right in front of me Weve got medical science and weve got ancientreligious symbols And what werespecifically looking at is how the accessoriesplay into your expectations I liked the visual partI didnt like the audio part  Interesting I wasnt connecting with it Woman 2 Ive always thoughtthat the kind of traditional ritualistic parts of churchthey just never appealed to me I think it was more the symbolsthat was more comforting because thats justthe way I was raised Michael One of the most intriguing was our final subject Miriam What was it like for you Um I went to another place OK OK I immediately felt my mothersher spirit with me  she was telling me  to come towards her OK And when I got close to hershe was comforting me  OK Um and I heard an angel say Im here with youI will never leave you  And I continued to see wings  Wings Interesting Yes Michael Miriams experience seemed to have  a profound effect on her  but I wanted to hear more about what exactly happened to her When you saythat you saw things describe for mewhat that was Was it like a daydreamor was it more like umreally there It was extremely vivid Um I could feel the windwhen it started going across I could vividly see my motherstanding there smiling at me  She looked beautiful Wow Michael The fact that Miriam had an outofbody experience  and saw her deceased mother was almost puzzling  because everything we did in the room was a lie  The priest was not real  the ritual was not a thousand years old  the nurse was an actress but yet Miriams experience  and those of the other participants were real The thing that surprised methe most today was how personalevery single moment was I think because of a combinationof the powerful imagery both religious and scientific it becomes the most powerfulexperience theyve had Even if yourea very staunch atheist a cross and a lectionary these thingstheyre pregnant with meaning We seem to have foundthat by using those cues people were able to tune invery very deeply and to relinquishtheir sense of selfcontrol Heres a question Whats the differencebetween what we did today and what an actual priestcan do Thats a reallycontroversial question Um I think the differenceis that unlike the priest we understand the mechanismsthrough a more psychologicalroute whereas many priestsmay themselves be convinced that they are facilitatingcommunication with the divine And perhaps they are The results can be the same regardless of the intentionsof the facilitators Theres no way to provewhether or not God worked in this room today I guess ultimatelywith the tools of scienceno there isnt These are stillsome really difficultphilosophical questions Michael So we have demonstrated that our brains are beliefmakingmachines Rather than accepting confusionand uncertainty we create superstitionsand beliefs that make us feel likewe have control over our lives In fact to not forma superstition or belief or guessabout the world around us is to be powerless even when superstitionsare unconnected to reality That doesnt meanthey cant be powerful Our reverse exorcism ritual and its practitionerswere all placebos But the mere existenceof our subjects beliefs in them made them realand transformative So does that make us all fools I dont knowbut I dont believe so And

How to Talk to Aliens,2019-01-02T17:00:06Z,26.116666666666667,6121828,0,MichaelWhere is everyone We have been listeningfor messages from outer space for more than half a century and so far silence Why Are we truly alonein the universe Or is everyone elseacting like us and just doing a lotof listening Maybe we need to be louder Maybe we need to sendmore messages out there But how do you write a letterto an extraterrestrial whose language and cultureand biology and mind we have no concept of And what do you say And given all of the unknownsabout what they might be should we sayanything at all  ♪♪ Ever since I was a kid Ive wanted to designa message that is sentto outer space A sort of hello from Earthto whatever extraterrestrials might be out there I mean come on to bethe author of the first thing aliens ever heardfrom our entire planet would be a fantastic honor And as it turns out an opportunity to senda message to space has been given to me But it mightbe a waste of time What if there isnt anything oranyone out there to receive it The fact that we still haveno evidence of intelligent alien life despite the high probabilitythat such life exists is called the Fermi paradox And there are manyentertaining theories that attempt to explain it One explanationis the theory that whenever twocivilizations meet destruction always results Which is why in 2015 several prominent expertswrote a letter warning against makingany contact at all Stephen Hawking Ideas like that suggest thatperhaps we should remain silent send no messages to space But Doug Vakochdisagrees He is the president of METI an organization thatdespite all of these concerns is nonethelessactively messaging extraterrestrialintelligence If I want to design a messagefor life out there I should talk to him first Why isnt he afraid  I met up with Doug  at the Chabot Observatory  home to the largest public refractor telescope  in the Western United States Douglas So here we areMichael Wow DouglasYeah This was one of the primetelescopes of a century ago This is really an antique Michael JeezIve seen so many observatories and so many big telescopesin pictures Believe it or not Ive neverbeen this close to one DouglasThis is a huge instrument and yet its balancedtoo exquisitely Im like a super personOh Douglas laughs It had quite a bitof momentum there Im scared to look Im telling you I had no ideaI would have this feeling seeing a telescope this bigDouglas Well it is it is Can I handlewhat I would see I think you canI think you can You just take a look Ahha Absolutely nothingDouglas Not tonight Because of the fogBecause of the fog MichaelJust the fog coming inis pretty darn cool  The universe has existed  longer than we have  but weve only been actively listening for life out there  for the last half century In 1960 astronomer Frank Drake began the search  with a 85foot radio telescope  He scanned for interstellar radio waves  but did not detect any recognizable signals Soon after SETI or Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence  was formed to continue our search  for other life in the universe  Mission Control Liftoff  Michael Besides just listening  weve also launched physical messages  like the Golden Records we put aboard  both Voyager spacecraft in 1977  The records were recordingsof images and sounds from Earth that told a story of who we are as Earthlings  as well as coded instructions on how to play them back  Today Doug and his team at METI  are on a mission to send new messages to the stars Thank you for taking some timeto have a conversation with me My first questionis simply this where is everyone Are we alone I dont think so You know weve been looking for over 60 years And so that leads some peopleto say we must be alone The reality is though we have justbegun the search I mean weve looked at a fewtens of thousands of stars and there are 400 billion starsin our galaxy alone Billions of galaxiesin the universe So I think we just needto keep on looking When you put it that way it actually isntthat surprising is it I mean we are still discoveringspecies on our own planet today At METI we switch the process and instead of just listeningfor signals we send powerful intentionalsignals to other stars in the hope of gettinga reply What do you sayto people who go Hold on we should not be alerting anylife out there to our presence Its just not worth the risk In fact its irresponsible I would say it is too late The horse is out of the barn We have been announcingour presence to the universe since the beginning of radioand television Any civilizationthat has the ability to travel between the stars already picked up I Love Lucy So maybe the alienshave been observing us but theyre waiting for usto break the silence So our goal isntto let them know were here for the first time Its to really givean indication that we wantto make contact The one thing thats keeping mefrom being really excited and comfortableabout sending a message out is that a lot of prominentpeople have said Dont There are some groupof scientists who have said you shouldnt be doing this Stephen Hawking But thats an exampleof someone very prominent who said you shouldnt transmit because maybe the alienswill come to Earth To me its notable thatafter his death to commemorate his lifehis family they transmitted his voiceout into space Anyone and everyone cantransmit to extraterrestrials So I think its an incrediblecontradiction for people involved in SETIto say we shouldnt transmit because the day they succeedeveryone will be transmitting Okay so how do we crafta message for ET Well it dependswhat we would want to do I would want to know somethingabout that civilization And so then we tryto figure out what is it that we havein common with the extraterrestrials What do you think the alienswould know that we know I always go to math So thats the naturalstarting place But how can you communicatethe idea of numbers Like this both clap Hey look were communicatingOkay okay great great You could keep that upYou could use that to count up to a million But that doesnt capturewhat it is to be human Right So you want to tella little bit about yourself The goal for me is to learnabout other civilizations if in facttheyre out there But I thinkeven if theyre not simply this processof reflecting on what stories do we want to tellabout ourselves how do we want to representourselves to the universe forces us to lookat ourselves anew And I think thatcan only be good One of my favorite messages that humans have ever sentfor extraterrestrials to some day receivewas written in 1974 by Frank Drakeand Carl Sagan They sent the message to a starcluster 25000 light years away It contained 1679binary digits that when decoded created an image the famous Arecibo message This message is full of generalinformation about us Up here in the whiteare numbers Now since math is probablypretty universal I feel like its fair to say that aliens will understandthat part But what about some of theseother parts This is a human figurebut will aliens be able to tell that that is supposed to be the shape of the thingthat made this Could an alien figure outwhat all these symbols mean For that matter could a humaneven correctly figure out what they all mean And I bet that if you wereto ask two people to guess what all this means you would gettwo different answers I want to give some humansa message and I want to see how quicklythey come up with meanings I didnt put in thereor conflicting interpretations because if that happens well it could spell troublefor our ability to say much more than simple mathematical truthsto whatever might be out there  To help me answer this question  I recruited Dr Steve Vance  Dr Vance leads a habitability team  for JPLs Astrobiology group  meaning its his job to think about the possibility  of life on other planets I dont think its crazy that if the Arecibo messageis received the alien civilizationthat gets it will see all kindsof meanings in it Theyre going to see thingsthrough the lens of how they experiencetheir world And I think if we receiveda message from outer space we would think of the onesweve sent out and we would lookfor these pieces in it And maybe the messagecontains none of those things Im really curiousabout this hypothesis that they will find meaningwhere there isnt any Theres onlyone way to find out Yeah Lets do itLets do it Michael To find out how individuals own backgrounds  would influence their approach to a message from space  we sought out a veritable Ateam  of critical thinkers and problem solvers  to put to the test Im a sophomore engineerand I have a PhD in physics Im a game designerand programmer I am a professionalpoker player Im a graphic artistand app coder I teach college coursesin writing film and psychology  This set of experts would be told  that the message they were receiving  was intercepted from outer space  and would be asked to decode it  using a variety of office supplies  and computer software  What they didnt know is that  although similar to the original Arecibo message  our message is just noise  Would our group of experts notice  that there was nothing to get  or apply their own meaningsto this indecipherable message  It was time to find out We received a message using a radio telescopefrom outer space Not the kind of thingthat naturally happens What we want to knowis what it says A copy of the messageas received is on that laptop This is an audio outputof that message Using your individual expertise and the toolsthat you have in front of you please figure outwhat this message is saying This is not an easy task OkayGood luck Okay you ready to listenLets hear it Here we go pings  Before the team can interpret  that our jumbled image is meaningless  they first have to figure out that theyre supposed  to decipher it visually  This would be the first step for any alien civilization  who received the real Arecibo message  To do that the first step is to recognize  that its binary  There are two different tones in the message man Is there a differencein time between any of these womanIt doesnt look like itThe rhythm doesnt vary manIt doesnt vary Theres going to be a repeatingpattern in there probably It seems liketheres only two notes Yeah it doesnt seem to goany higher or lower than that So theres only two tonesWere thinking some kind of binary messagezeros and ones We should probablystart transcribing it  and look for repeating patterns Right off the batall right Theyre noticing two tonesbinary message I think thats a veryhuman thing to do because we alreadycome to this knowing that binary is thisgreat way to talk right So were already seeing into itwhat we expect to see Okay so we have a wayto encode binary into letters So if an alien intelligenceis sending things we obviously wouldnt know that and it wouldnt bethe same language anywayRight So theyre probably just sendingus straight numbers Like theres you knowuniversal language and all that So we got to find outwhat those numbers are Okay lets havethree people do this just so we make surewe dont miss anything Lets do zero for lowone for high and lets startwriting it down womanZero one zero zero zero Now they are creatinga visual representation of these different tones The key is to see how many tonesthere are Zero zeroOh wait sorry I got it pinging womanDo we need to play it in halftime because I feel likewere scramblingYeah were just scrambling manNo worries no worries MichaelThe message is 17 minutes long  with 1679 individual tones Because this would take so long to transcribe  I decided to help them speed up the process This thumb drive containsa transcription of the message pretty much just likewhat youre doing right now But now youre just kind ofjumped ahead in time Fast forward yeah Here it isThank you All right we will continueAll right Ill leaveyou guys to it manOkay this is pretty long here womanIts not repeating at all Does it look likean even distribution of zeros and ones No theres way more zerosthan ones woman Yeahman Okay So what is the totalnumber of woman1679 total man1679 Is that divisibleby anything in particular Its a prime numberCould be a prime number Its going to be hard to testthat without writing a script Just divide dividedivide divide manLets do a little division Michael Just like the Arecibo message  our meaningless image contains  1679 total tones  The number 1679 can only be divided into two prime numbers  23 and 73  When you arrange the ones and zeros  from the message into a 23by73 grid  the jumbled image will begin to emerge  If the group can discover this feature of 1679  they may be able to start breaking down the tones  of the message into an image Ooh Ooh Hey its hey yothis is important guys This number breaks downto 23x73 Okay Ahha There it is And that isthe only breakdown because 23 and 73are prime numbers So thats its primefactorization So that is very relevant Wow Look at the big brainon that dude man Do you think its worth it to try and straight up likemake a 23by73 grid and then you couldsay that the lows are white and the ones are black and maybe theres some kindof image being sent there I like that idea Hey man Im strongly with the graph idea womanWhat Im doing right now is Impasting it into Excel and then we can graph itin Excel and seeYeah thats good BonnieYou mean like fill the cells Yeahand make the numbers whiteand all that Yeah Shes going to try to make thisa little easier by coloring all of the cellsthat have a one in themThats great We picked these people becauseof their knowledge of mathematicsand physics and music But their knowledgeof how to use Excel is proving to be the best skill  Amazingly in just a couple of hours  the team figured out how to break down  our fake Arecibo message into an image  Will they try to find meaning in the message  or will they realize its just noise Oh Im doneGuys Im done Oh you did itThat was fast manThat looks sadly random That almost looks like itsgoing to resolve into something womanMaybe its a map Those arent letters are theyThey could be manNo theyre all back halfof the alphabet then Except forlittle nine over here Little nine Look at that littlenine woman Baby nineman Thats an I right Im pretty suretheres nothing there Theres no pattern here Do we agree like this probablylooks like nothing womanYeah I dont think going anyfurther with this is really ProductiveOkay  Our group had followed the clues correctly  and built out an image  even though there wasnt one that made sense  And incredibly they didnt try to make sense of it  Within a matter of minutes  they realized it was random and moved on  So it was time to let them in on the ruse Hello again All right sothis is Steve Vance Hes taken the day offfrom JPL Have you learned anythingabout the message What do you know It seems very random still Though it did have a nice primefactorization That did not seemrandom to me Let me show you guyssomething new manWhat the heck It looks like 23 across I see how youre doing thisOh we were almost there We tried arrangingthese ones and zeros kind of in these blocks woman But theres somepatterns repeating there that we dont actually havemapped correctly here MichaelNow this is not the messagethat youre looking at This is the famousArecibo message Now what you have beenworking on is this message but randomized laughs Thanks a lot all laugh Oh Im just going to collapseon the ground now In a way you guys werequite successful You first of all recognized the semiprime natureof this message very quickly and tried to build an image I was wonderingif you would start to see things therethat werent But it didnt really happendid it I think the real reasonthat we werent interpreting anything out of that is we were lookingfor clearly defined patterns Were lookingfor something like this This is actuallywhat were looking for Even symmetry would have beena big thing for me If Id seen any symmetryin these patterns I would have saidThis is not random Im also interestedin knowing the best kindof message to send because I have an opportunityto send a message You know a markerto where we are is kind ofthe biggest thing for me but then its like do we reallywant to tell them where we are Is that somethingDo we want them to come visit I dont knowWhat do you guys think Should we be sending messagesto outer space allYeah yes MatthewI dont think we should Every single timeany civilization encounters any othercivilization and one is technologicallyadvanced one guy gets crushed You know what if theyre notmore advanced than us What if were at the same place and the only way we cancommunicate is like this What if we can just exchangethe recipe for fusion We would have so much to learnfrom those people and really nothing to losein that situation Youre making an argument that we almost havea moral imperative to send our knowledge to sharewith other civilizations Absolutely yesIts a really interestingpoint Thats kind of where I land Lets just think of thisas a way to preserve the storiesthat weve been able to tell which by the way we tellbetter than the universe does Thank you all so muchThis was a phenomenal exercise allThanks Thank you You know honestly I thoughtthat the human tendency to find meaning where there isnone would more quickly emerge But that didnt really happen What I also didnt expectwas just how educational the whole challengewould be I mean I saw some human flawsand biases at work but more generallyI saw the human mind at work who we are Which kind of makes senseright I mean the VoyagerGolden Record really isnt just a neat thingfor extraterrestrials Its a neat archive byof and for us I dont think we will allever agree about whether or notwe should be sending messages to outer spaceannouncing that we are here But heres the thing Sending focused messagesto outer space requires technologythat not all of us have So only those with access can say hello toextraterrestrials if they want But who chose themto speak for us for all of Earth Well Ive come hereto Vazquez Rocks State Park to talk to a manwho is changing that He is democratizing active SETIbecause the service he has built is allowing anyone to sendany message they want to outer space  Hes an expert in the field of alien communication  with a doctorate in elementary particle physics  and hes the one whos going to help me send my message Tell me about the wayyou are talking to aliens and helping otherpeople do it Well I have built a websitecalled SpaceSpeakcom And it allows peopleto send a text in audio or a image messageout into space My view is as many peoplethat can reach out to aliens or the universe in generalthe better What are you usingto transmit these messages Radio waves Radio waves arejust another form of photon And once a photon is broadcastinto space it persists It never diesIt never decays A million years from nowmaybe the earth is gone maybe the solar system is gone but your messageis still out there and essentially becomearchaeological photons for some future generationto see what we were about I want to do thisAbsolutely lets do it AwesomeGreat Going to take a chairright here AndThis is it This is the Space Speaktransmitter This is a transmitter box here And the antennais right back here Ive been thinkingabout this a lot and Ive spokento a lot of people about what to sendhow to write the message and whether or notI should send anything at all I dont think this is somethingto take as fact Its my personal opinion I dont have any fearthat this is dangerous YeahI spent a lot of time constructing what I believe to be a really neatclever idea I was going to not senda twodimensional image like the Arecibo but a threedimensional imagemade of voxels And I got really into this And then after talking to youand really thinking about the point of communicatingwith outer space beyond Earth II just think to decide what to sayand how to say it is an exercise in learninghow we communicate at all YesIts always coming back to who we are My grandmother passed awaya few days ago Im so sorryto hear that Im actually leaving tomorrowto her funeral and Ill get to seeall of my family And obviously Im never goingto forget my grandma And the way she you knowmade me who I am that will in a way like echolike ripples in a pond right For generations to come But this is a messagemade of light that will be around forever until the universe endssomehow So I have the last photograph that was ever takenof us together Id like to sendthat picture out Lets do itOkay This photo is herin the hospital using one of those likegrabber tools you know to pull my beard hairsand hurt me laughs And she was so weakbut with that tool she could pinch Oh thats awesomeIts a great picture of who we were She wasnt a big fan of aliens as far as I know but its uscaught in this moment that I think I wantto remember and I want the universeto remember So well lets do it Yeah Go ahead and hit send Wow Its sentAnd look at that Its already 229435 milesaway from EarthYes I dont think she ever traveledthat far in her entire life Now she hasShe has now absolutely MichaelAnd she will continue traveling Your grandmotherwill touch the universe Yeah Peter thank youvery much You are very welcome sirIt was a pleasure Michael And as always  thanks for watching

Should I Die?,2018-12-26T17:00:07Z,31.083333333333332,5743731,0,Someday I will die But should I If I was offereda longer life I would take thatin a second But how long is too long Is death somethingI should deny forever or is death and the roleit plays in the universe something I am better offaccepting I want to start by lookingat a particular way death affects how we liveand treat one another Terror Management Theory proposes that peoplelike you and me manage the terrorof deaths inevitability by embracing cultural values That the more aware a person isof their own mortality the more vehementlythey will enforce their particular viewsof the world onto others Created by social psychologists Sheldon Solomon  Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pyszczynski  Terror Management Theory or TMT  suggests that often we are afraid of change  because were afraid of death  Each one of us has a worldview  a set of beliefs customs and norms  we identify with that can live on after our physical bodies die  TMT suggest that rises in nationalism and prejudice  are correlated with rises in the salience of mortality  That is how present the inevitability of death is  in peoples minds Now this role that death plays fascinates me  and two of TMTs originators Jeff and Sheldon  have agreed to work with me on a pilot study  of Terror Management Theory  and reallife reminders of death Whats your hypothesis today Well I think were goingto hope for the participants who are remindedof their mortality to be more punitivein their assessments See what happens  For our study  we created a fake research center  staffed by actors  and invited participants to be a part  of what they were told was a focus group  about the criminal justice system  During the actual study each group will hear a list  of several different crimes that have been committed  and will then be asked to propose a punishment  for each offender with a severity level  ranging from 1 to 7 with 1 being the most lenient  and 7 being the most severe  The control group will simply enter the survey room  and be asked to answer the questions  The experimental group however  will first be exposed  to reminders of their own mortality  with strategically placed posters in the lobby  Also the questionnaires they fill out  will include questions about their own death  Decades of TMT researchhave shown that when presented  with violations of common worldviews  those who are more aware of their own deaths  will recommend bigger punishments  for the crimes presented  But will our real life reminders of death  not just the survey questions usually used  make a difference  Well first lets look at the control participants woman Well thank youso much for being here Now I cannotemphasize this enough There are noright or wrong answers This is just aboutyour gutlevel reactions All right lets begin After raising millionsof dollars in grant money to fund educationfor needy children a fundraising managerunhappy with this life fled with all the money and was arrested months laterin Tasmania where he was livingunder a different name So 1 least punishmentthree months in prison 7 is most severeten years in prison Please answer now This is one that I think doeshave worldviews on both sides Michael That is a lot of 7s  If our control group is already maxing out like that  well then our scale has no room in that direction  to show any effect of mortality salience  Discovering issues like thislearning how to better isolate  mortality saliences effect  is exactly what a pilot test is for Hey personal differences huh woman An imposterwith no medical training posed as a surgeon and bungleda minor operation to remove a childs tonsils The patient recovered fullyafter additional treatment 1 is six months on probation7 is ten years in prison SheldonOkay If you are taking on the personaof a doctor we would expect good behavior woman The surgeon botchedthe operation and was found to be underthe influence of narcotics causing her to have permanenthoarseness and ruining her career A 16yearold girl who had justreceived her license drove through a red light hitting another carthat was being driven by a talented pianist A couple was taking their twochildren to the playground when they saw a womansunbathing nude Look at thatThere could be a gender gap Were also learning a lot aboutthe worldviews people have JeffYeah absolutely An antigovernment protesterwas arrested for spraypainting profanitiesat the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC 1 40 hours Wow she went 1right away Shes not a fan of authorityand rules SheldonYeah Okay thank you so muchfor your time We really appreciate it All right so heres the results in a mathematical analysis These are averages per question These are the averagesand medians per participant Jeff The 4s are greatThe 3s great But this is groundfor optimism at least Michael 7 was the max sentencing value  and our control group gave an average of 45 Im really happy with thatas a control group Absolutely  Now our experimental groups  Remember they will be seeing posters that remind them  of their own mortality  and will be asked different questions  in their questionnaire  For example  The point is to prime their mortality salience  Lets see if this group is more punitive  towards worldview violations After raising millionsof dollars to fund educationfor needy children a fundraising managerfled with all the money and was arrested months laterin Tasmania 1 three months in prison 7 ten years in prison Please answer now Okay hes thinkingabout it Please hold up your answers All rightThank you so much Ah okay woman An imposterwith no medical training posed as a surgeon and bungleda minor operation to remove a childs tonsils 1 six months on probation 7 ten years in prison They are thinking a lot moreYeah Sheldon WowMichael A 10 Im pretty sure she knowsthat 7 is the highest JeffWell call it a 7 Its funny to seewhen people feel bold enough even though Im breakingthe bounds and the rules of the task An antigovernment protesterwas arrested for spraypainting profanitiesat the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC SheldonI really do appreciate the way they clearly seem to betaking a bit more time to deliberateYeah Okay they can putthe papers down and tell them that we will be inshortly womanOkay thank you so much Weve finished with this partof the study So if you wont mindhanging out for a moment and our researcherswill be in here in a moment to ask you a couple questions Michael Lets find out if the reminders of mortality  we showed our experimental group were salient enough JeffLet me ask you about one thing Out in the waiting room did you all noticethe posters at all womanYes they are all deathrelated Okay All right Yeah Thats rightall laugh So we are looking into something thats calledTerror Management Theory And its the idea that your ownawareness of your mortality can affect the behaviorsthat you exhibit That we all manage the terrorthat we feel knowing that we are mortalby behaving in certain ways especially in ways thatreinforce our own worldviews Because we could kind of live onthrough the societies and cultures and identitiesthat we have today Jeff Did any of you feel likeyou were still thinking a little bit about deathwhen you came in here I was definitely goingafter people who transgressed against my worldviewto use your term Yes I noticed thatI was definitely doing that MichaelSo this was incredibly helpful Jeff YeahMichael Thank you very much Jeff Thanks so muchI appreciate MichaelIt looks like our experimental stimuli were successful  They were salient but didnt cause the participants  to think they were related to the study The control participantsaveraged about 45 The experimental participantswere close to 47 if we round up So theres a slight tendencyfor the experimental people to be leaning in the directionthat we predicted But were talking about relatively inconsequentialdifferences Thats right It just makes mehungry to run more people And with the number that we had thats statisticallyinsignificant Do you think that we didsee any effects of mortality salience today Jeff I feel like the mortalitysalient groups tended to think a littlelonger before responding Yeah me too JeffAnd they seemed more thoughtful They were reallyThey put more effort into it into trying to dothe right thing The difference was dramaticenough that we picked up on it Absolutely Although our stimuli  might need to go through more passes and more vetting  we did find an interesting difference  in the time it took  for our groups to respond  Our control group took an average  of 4 minutes and 46 secondsto decide on their punishments  but our experimental group  took an average of 7 minutes 18 seconds In a sensethat really is the prediction The right thingby their own worldview but by the same tokenwhen we think about death we want to do whats right And if were actinglike jurors we want to makethe right decisions As we very much learned today the goal isnt to proveone thing one way or the other Its just to reduceuncertainty Thats correctin the most careful way Absolutely To know a little bitmore today than yesterday JeffYeah MichaelOur pilot test shows that theres still a lotto discover about terror management and many promising waysto do it Im particularly intriguedby our observation that for allthe closedmindedness mortality salienceappears to cause it also leadto what looked like increased considerationand thought Id love to see more researchon that idea But the point is this if deaths effectsarent all entirely bad what if instead of or at least at the same time that we hope for the abolitionof natural death we also find a wayto accept it Now obviously I dontwant to die at least not soon But accepting the inevitabilityof my own death and being less afraid of itfeels powerful and honest Id like to learnwhat that looks like And I have a friendwho can help  Im paying a visit to Caitlin Doughty  a mortician authorand death positivity activist  who has made an entire career out of discussing  the aspects of death that most of us prefer to ignore What do you say to someonewho comes to you and says I think death is terrifyingIts so scary and sad that Im just here now Is this person dyingor is this person This person is mein front of you right now This person is youOkay so I would tell youa couple things First youre dealing withthe primal existential quandary of human existence YesAnd you are one of you know the many billions of peoplewho have felt this So youre not alonein feeling this way So we go through lifeWe reach a certain age and we begin to understand that someday ourselvesand everyone we love will die And thats powerfulpainful knowledge And I think from that moment We have to start developingdefense mechanisms to handle that and to integratethat into our lives So what are those defensemechanisms I think that the more obviousones would be having a child writing a bookmaking a TV show creating a legacyof some kind But theres also a moreinsidious version which is war Taking other countries Being rich and being okay withother people being poor I think those are all signsof death denial Theyre all saying But Im okaybecause I have this money or I have this power or I havethese kind of dark impulses that allow me to say at leastI can outrun death in that way And of coursethats not true No one can outrun death But you can trick yourselfinto believing that So how would youcharacterize the Western relationshipto death Take America 150 years ago If you were my husbandand you died I would be entirelyin charge of you I would wash your body I would get the neighborto make a wooden coffin for you We would put you in the coffinand carry you on our shoulders to the grave which someonehad dug themselves RightIt would have been an entirely selfsufficientprocess But what happened aroundthe turn of the 20th century is really three big thingsin my mind One you had the riseof hospitals So people were no longerdying at home You had the riseof funeral homes which means that we are nowoutsourcing our death The third oneis slaughterhouses So all of a suddenall food production and the killing of animalsis also hidden as well And we live inour suburban houses where all those thingsare outsourced And its just these layers andlayers of denial around death But what does it meanto accept death I dont think that you evertruly accept death But I believe that the movementtoward accepting death involves really trueselfawareness about where youre hidingyour fears of death Thats where real awarenessand acceptance can come from For me the thing thats justsuch a bummer about death is that I just am done I dont get to continuelearning things and seeing what happens And Im just not partof Earth anymore Isnt death kind of what givesyou that passion when you think about it Like I love learningI love ideas If you didnt have an end pointare you going to come in here with all these cameras and dothe huge amount of legwork that creating a show requiresNo No Right Because youre likeI dont know maybe Ill do it 200 years from now Whereas right now youre takingin information left and right because you wantto produce content You want to produceexciting things and share with other people Because this is my one chanceThis is your one chance The passion and the realnessto life comes from an ending Thats the great giftthat death gives us Whats an unhealthy relationshipto have to your own mortality The pursuit of immortality and the pursuit ofI will stay alive until I can upload my braininto the cloud That worries me The idea that everyoneis just allowed to live foreverfrom here on out is not environmentally sensible Its not You know its justnot a sensible position to take narrator We are seeing the dawn  of a new era of possibilities unfold  on planet Earth  What will our amazing world be like in say 80  100 or even 200 years from now  Wouldnt you like the possibility  of finding out Michael To understand why some people  feel like death shouldnt be inevitable  Ive come to Alcor  one of the worlds leading life extension facilities Linda Hi Im MichaelHi how are you Great to meet youNice to meet you too Welcome to AlcorThank you for having me here  Im meeting Linda Chamberlin  who cofounded Alcor nearly 46 years ago So this facility that we are inright now is where you both cryopreservepeople and store them LindaYes We have 160 patients WowAnd we have eleven hundredand ninetysomething members It changesAnd a member is someone who is alive today but hasAlive today Theyve made the arrangementsfor this Once they are cryopreservedthey become patients Youre usingthe word patient YesOkay Tell me about why you usethat word For us death is not somethingwhich is like an onoff switch One second youre alivethe next second youre dead MmhmmWhat we are trying to do is to slow down and stopthe dying process Michael To become a patient at Alcor  first you have to pay between 80 and 200000  Then you have to die  or more specificallybe pronounced clinically dead  This generally means that your heart and lungs  have stopped functioning  At that point Alcor can begin their work Now there are two waysthat a person could sign up for this procedure Theres a wholebody patientor as a neuro Oh and does neurojust mean head It means yesthe cephalon actually which is all of the structuresdown to about the clavicle UhhuhIm a neuro Everybody in my familywhos now in stasis is a neuro ReallyMost of the people who really understandthe technology are neuros The primary reason that peoplechoose whole body is emotional Of courseAnd theyre not comfortable with the idea of their bodybeing removed and discarded So lets say that our patientis whole body The moment the patientis pronounced they go into an ice bath And this is just crushed ice And its waterin there as well Their heart has started againwith a mechanical thumper Theyre intubated and theirlungs are functioning again Being ventilated Circulating the coolertemperatures Yeah yeah yeahSo you need the veins the arteriesthe vasculature the heart You need all of those continuingto pump and circulate LindaThis is our operating room MichaelWow So basically when the patient comes inthrough the door there theyll go into this speciallydeveloped operating table It is going to be circulatingnitrogen gas over them to help cool them externally And if its a wholebodypatient then the surgeonsopen the chest and then we begin circulatingthe organ transplant solution Michael Once in the operating room  the patients blood is replaced  with cooled organ transplant fluid  and circulated through the vascular system  to rapidly cool down the internal  and external temperatures of the body  Just before the water within the body tissue  reaches its freezing point  cryoprotective fluids are introduced  These act like antifreeze  preventing the formation of ice crystals  that could damage soft tissue  This is called the vitrification process Now say that it isa neuro patient So they come in first hereYup their whole body Right The surgeons will dothe neuro separation first Okay yeah that makes senseSeparate the cephalon which is all of the structuresdown to about the clavicle Bring it over here to this operating field Well wash the blood out And we introduce the organtransplant solution Im imagininga persons cephalon essentially their headin here I can see how its goingto get clamped in LindaYeah MichaelThat looks like Im sure a crazy scifi movie But it really happensIt really happens MichaelAfter the vitrification process is complete  the patients are placed inside bags  that are attached to open metal cases  which are then placed inside cylindrical tanks  filled with liquid nitrogen called dewars So this is ourpatient care bay We have 159 patients In these tanks right hereIn these tanks There are approximately nine patientsin each one of these Four whole bodiesand five neuros This one right here is where my husbandis currently housed This one right hereRight This is where Fred isat the moment My mother and my fatherinlaware in this one MichaelWow its so weird because I am right nownot in a graveyard No Alcor is very muchlike an ambulance taking their loved onesto a hospital not down the street but a hospital in the futureYeah When technologycan help them Theyre not being transportedthrough space but through timeTime Michael To see what drivesthis timetraveling ambulance  Im going to sit down with Max More  Alcors CEO and a future neuro patient So Max whats the statusof the technology needed to revive cryopreservedspecimens Are we getting closerWe are getting closer Its going to be decadesat least before we can bring backwhole human beings But we already cryopreserveeggs sperm microbes of skin corneas heart valvesall kinds of things So those are single tissuesAnd we can reverse that process MmhmmYou move from that to an organ things get more difficult But we actually did anexperiment a few years ago We took this little tiny worm We used a certain chemicalso wed learn that oh my foods over hereand not over here And we cryopreserved them And then we just waitedbrought them back and then we tested them We were able to demonstratewith the memory test that the ones that have receivedthe training retained that memory So it was the first timeany organism weve proven to survivewith memory So now were asking okaywhats the next step Because whole organisms aredifficult to reverse right now But step by stepthe more progress we can make the more convincing this isWow When it comesto extending life some questions come up likeshould people die I know we dont likethe idea of death I know what youre getting atBut you lose something by getting rid of death Yeah well lose something like we lost somethingwhen we got rid of slavery or smallpox So I think people people are tying themselvesin knots to rationalize death I believe thatright now were kind of inthis tragic situation where over time hopefullyyou kind of learn Your wisdom grows over time At the same time your cognitive and physicalhealth is declining That really sucksThats a bad situation What if they both could keepgoing up indefinitely So you could live for hundredsof years or longer and get smarter and moreknowledgeable and wiser Hopefully more matureand have more foresight because you got a much longerplanning horizon What well have is a worldof I call ultramature people which I think will actuallybe a better world than the onewe have today And if they say wellAnd this comes up all the time They say Well death is whatgives life meaning Bullshit okayIf that was true then would they also advocatepeople who live to 90 should be killed off at 45 Will that double the meaningin their life In fact I think life gets moremeaning the longer you live because you can buildon what youve done before So if anything it increasesthe meaningfulness of life in my view Youre making me realizethat in many ways I am rationalizing death Im looking for waysto excuse it and accept it I dont think its unhealthyto accept that you are mortal Well I have to accept it because I could get killedat any time One thing I have to stress because everyarticle written they always have to usethe word forever or immortality And thats noton the table here Were just offering a chancefor people to be revived when weve beaten aging And eventually somethingsgoing to get you So were not offeringimmortality Were offering an unknownextension of human lifespan Do I think that someday we willbe able to cryonically freeze an entire personand then revive them Yes I do I believe thatcryopreservation will change the meaningof death and lead to breakthroughsin medical technology that will improveall of our lives But do I want to extend my lifeindefinitely Well on the one hand obviously deathis a bummer But on the other the universe managed finewithout me for billions of years Am I really so important that it should nevernot have me again Should I be aroundas long as possible Or do those who will come laterdeserve their own world Should I tryto extend my life Or should I decide to diewhen my time comes and return all this matterIm borrowing back to the world Well I dont thinktheres a right answer Its a personal choicewe each get to make and should be able to make And Ive been thinkingabout it a lot  So Im going to speak again with my friend Caitlin  the mortician to confront my own mortality Well Caitlin thanks formeeting with me again Ive been surroundedby death lately Spoke to youI visited Alcor And you know if we never invented technologyto bring people back then the Alcor patientsare dead But they have that hope I worked onTerror Management Theory And I even had a loved onepass away just two weeks ago My grandmotherOh Im sorry to hear that She was crematedas was my father And I realized you know Ive never made a clear decisionabout what should happen to me Because I just figured Ill figure that outwhen Im older But I could die at any timeYou sure could So I want to be prepared And I want my wishesto be known YeahSo I have decided when that moment comes I want it to be my final momentof existence I want to give all my atoms andmolecules back to the universe And Ive decided thatI want to die Oh Im so gladyouve made that decision And youve cometo the right place I want to be naturally buried I want to have a green burial You know become worm foodand plant food I want it allto go back to earth But I kind of want a placewhere people can come to be likethats where he was buried So theres everything fromjust little discs in the ground where you areto GPS that locates you to natural cemeteries that are trying to reintroducenative plants Yeah yeah yeahSo you know you can have your ownJoshua tree So the first thing Im goingto give you to give a look over is whats calledan advanced directive OkayAnd everybody needs to have one of these And why its so importantis that its you not only designating someoneto be in charge of your body as youre dyingright after you die and then with however you decideto dispose of it But also who that person is So this isnt just about burialThis is dying Its about death dyingdeath and after death InterestingMmhmm Michael A choice like this  is extremely new to humans It used to be your only options upon death  were cremation embalming or rotting away  But today you can chose topause yourself at deaths door  until the door has been moved somewhere else  But Ive decided not to do that So Im ready to make thisofficial Fire in the holeOkay Whoo All rightHow do you feel Weirdly I feelvery relaxed and good It was kind of lifechangingbut what it really was was deathchanging Ha well thank you andIm glad youve decided to die Thank you  Jeff and Sheldon  thank you for showing methe power of deaths influence  Caitlin thank you for helping me accept it  Max thank you for the work you are doing  and the opportunities you are offering humanity  And all you out thereas always thanks for watching,140.07506702412869,inconsequentialdifferences,1.0,-0.9,zRxI0DaQrag,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRxI0DaQrag
The Stanford Prison Experiment,2018-12-19T17:00:03Z,34.46666666666667,15210727,343559,One of the most infamous psychological studiesever conducted was the Stanford PrisonExperiment Its mentioned in almost everyintro to psychology textbook They tend to focus onhow unethical it was and are less criticalof its supposed conclusion  August 14th 1971  Palo Alto California  Twelve young men are rounded up from their homes by police  placed under arrest  and brought to a makeshift prison  in the basement of Stanford University  It all begins as a study on the psychology of prison life  led by Stanford psychology professor Dr Philip Zimbardo  24 volunteers  12 guards and 12 prisoners  have agreed to spend the next two weeks  recreating life in a correctional facility guard  The prisoners are booked and stripped nude  Theyre no longer individuals  forced to wear smocks stocking caps and shackles  Identified only by their prisoner numbers  The guards quickly adapt to their new profession  Given anonymity by their mirrored sunglasses  some of them start to control the meager food rations  restrict prisoners bathroom use  And as tensions rise  so do their cruel methods  Within just six days of the planned twoweek study  conditions are so bad  that the entire operation is shut down man Goddamn it  The study makes international headlines  Zimbardos fame skyrockets  and his conclusions are taught to students worldwide  used as a defense in criminal trials  and are even submitted to Congress  to explain the abuses inflicted at Abu Ghraib  The study brings up a question  just as important then as it is today  is evil caused by the environment  or the personalities in it  Zimbardos shocking conclusion  is that when people feel anonymous  and have power over depersonalized others  they can easily become evil  And it occurs more often than wed like to admit But while its true that peoplewere mean to each other during the StanfordPrison Experiment what if what truly causedthat behavior wasnt what weve alwaysbeen told  The Stanford Prison Experiment  has always had its controversies  But a wave of recent revelations  have pushed it back into the spotlight  47 years later  Today Im going to speak with journalist Ben Blum  whose recent writings have brought criticism  of the experiment to a larger audience  than ever before How did you get involved inthe Stanford Prison Experiment in the first place Well my involvementwas quite personal Like everyoneI had kind of absorbed the basic lessonof the experiment through the cultural ether And then my cousin Alexwas arrested for bank robbery This was a team of mostlymilitary guys with AK47s Alex was the driver He was a 19yearoldUS Army Ranger And it was a superior of hison the Rangers that organized and ledthe bank robbery Alex thought the whole thingwas a training exercise He was just so brainwashedin this intense Ranger training that when a superior proposedthis bank robbery he took it as just one more kindof tactical thought experiment Then Dr Philip Zimbardoparticipated in his legal defense Zimbardo submits a letterto the court advocating leniencyin sentencing on the grounds that Alex my cousinhad been so transformed by the social environmentof the Ranger battalion that he participatedin the bank robbery without exercisinghis own free will Well how did that affectAlexs sentencing He received an extraordinarilylenient sentence of 16 months So Zimbardo was a family hero But over time Alexfinally he did admit to me you know what I knew this wasa bank robbery by the end and I just didnt have the moralcourage to back out Oh wow Alex myself and ourwhole family came to viewthe Zimbardo argument as a way to shirk personalculpability and to put all the blameon the situation So you start looking at the Stanford PrisonExperiment in particular You reached out to Dr Zimbardohimself as well as some of thosewho participated What did you learn I learnedto my deep surprise that quite a numberof the participants had stories of their experiencethat completely contradicted the official narrative Which is lookthese regular people good peoplecame together and because of the situationbecame evil BenRight Zimbardo has claimedthat the guards were put in the situation and then the kind of hiddenwellspring of sadism that apparently liesin all of us unfolded organically Zimbardo There was an orientation meetingfor the guards They had been toldquite explicitly to oppress the prisoners That falls under the headingof what psychologists call demand characteristics Experimental subjectstend to be motivated to give experimenterswhat they want Michael Demand characteristics occur  whenever participants being studied  act differently than they normally would  because theyve guessedwhat hypothesis is being tested  and feel that a certain kind of behavior is being demanded There was a recordingof explicitly correcting a guard who wasnt being tough enough So a conclusionyou could make from the StanfordPrison Experiment is that when you tell peopleto be cruel theyll do it if you tell them its for a greater goodlike science RightWho would have thought I think the study stands stillas a fascinating spur to further more careful research as a demonstration that shouldmake anyone curious as to how such extreme behaviorcould arise in such a short time The experiment could stillbe useful but it might need to bereinterpreted Its data might leadto different conclusions than the one that weve beentelling for so many decades Right  The flaws in the experiment  that Ben and other critics bring up  call into question large portions of the narrative  surrounding the study  So I want to hear from someone who was actually there  Dave Eshelman the studys most infamous guard  agreed to tell me his side of the story Its really an honorto meet you Youre a living walking pieceof psychology history Im never recognized in thestreet or anything like that although I still getsome hate mail Are you seriousYeah absolutely Well what do you say to themwhen they react that way I say well theres probablya lot about that that didnt happen quite the wayits been portrayed Well Davebefore we go too far Id like to watch the footagewe have here so we can kind of talk aboutwhat we see DaveThats me there by the way Michael Look at that lookDave Mmhmm So how did you get involved witha Stanford Prison Experiment My father was a professorat Stanford and I was home for summerlooking for a summer job So Im lookingthrough the want ads 15 a day You knowin 1971 that wasnt bad The way it was introducedto the guards the whole conceptof this experiment we were never led to believe that we were partof the experiment We were led to believethat our job was to get resultsfrom the prisoners that they were the onesthe researchers are really studying The researcherswere behind the wall And we all knewthey were filming And we can often hearthe researchers commenting on the actionfrom the other side of the wall You know likeOh gosh did you see that Here Make sure you geta closeup of that Okay So if they want to showthat prison is a bad experience Im going to make it bad But how did you feeldoing stuff like that Didnt you feel bad I dont know if thisis a revelation to you but 18yearold boys are notthe most sensitive creatures SureMy agenda was to be the worst guardI could possibly be And its pretty seriousMmhmm This is my favorite partof all the footage we have from the experimentMmhmm Its you and a prisonerconfronting each other after the experiment I remember the guy sayingI hate you man YeahI hate you Each day I said wellwhat can we do to ramp up what we did yesterday How can we build on that Why did you wantto ramp things up Two reasons I think One was becauseI really believed I was helping the researcherswith some better understanding of human behavior On the other hand it was personallyinteresting to me You know I cannot say that Idid not enjoy what I was doing Maybe you knowhaving so much power over these poordefenseless prisoners you know maybe you kind ofget off on that a little bit You werent entirely followinga script from a director Right But you also felt like Zimbardo wanted somethingfrom you YesAnd you gave that to him I believe I didI think I decided I was going to do a better jobthan anybody there of deliveringwhat he wanted But does that excuse mefrom what I was doing Certainly it started outwith me playing a role So the question is was therea point where I stopped acting and I started livingso to speak The standard narrative is thatDave Eshelman did what he did because when peopleare given power its easier than we thinkfor abuse to happen That may be true but how predisposedto aggression was Dave I mean he signed upto something called a prison study after all Also his feelingthat cruelty was encouraged and helped the experimentmay have affected his behavior What Id like to see is in the absenceof outside influence can anonymity powerand depersonalization alone lead to evil  To answer that question  Id like to design  a demonstration of my own  So Im meeting with Dr Jared Bartels  of William Jewell College  a psychologist who has written extensively  about the Stanford Prison Experiment  and how it is taught I would love to do the StanfordPrison Experiment again You could probably make itmore ethical but still find the sameconclusions Thats my hypothesis I absolutely thinkits worthwhile Its importantIts interesting Probably the best approach is eliminate as best as possiblethe demand characteristics by eliminating thatprisonerguard dynamic Why do we even need to call onegroup guards and one prisoners Theres a lot of expectations around those roles Oh Im a guard I guess I should act like aguard Yeah youre right The cover story is reallyimportant and you want to hide the truepurpose of the experiment Another piece of thisis the role of personality and personality traits So the original adin the Stanford study asked for participantsfor a study of prison life You know thats going to drawcertain people that were more kind of disposedto aggression MichaelBecause they saw the wordprison and thought I want to be a part of thatExactly So when you get a group of kind of authoritarianmindedindividuals together not surprisinglytheyre going to create an authoritarian regimeand environment So for whatever it is thatwere going to do we should evaluatethe personalities of the individuals Right So how do we give peopleevery opportunity to be as evil as they can I think you haveto have those elements that were assumedto be influential in the Stanford study What are those elements You have to havethe depersonalization You have to have anonymity You have to have some powerdifferences Can we elicitsome surprising behaviors in just a number of hours If you kind of come backto the Stanford study there wasnt anything dramaticthat happened in the first day of the studyYeah It was the second dayof the study when the guards started toassert their authority That came about becauseof prisoners testing and challenging the guardsauthority MichaelYeah and that led to fear That like wait a secondthese prisoners need to be put more in checkYeah Yeah So I think you still needthat provocation Yeah Something that is frustrating Something thats goingto increase the participants arousal Right All right so Jared would you liketo spend some time now brainstorming a new design that peeks into the samequestions AbsolutelyAwesome Michael Jared and I sat down with the Mind Field crew  to begin the planning process Will a personwithout any expectations or pushes in a certain directionstill be abusive or not  For this demonstration  we want to eliminate all outside variables  and really isolate the three core elements  of the Stanford Prison Experiment  The first element is anonymity  Subjects need to believethat no matter how they behave  no one will know it was them This is where people will becoming in in the morning This way everyones going to bestaggered when they come in Thats importantbecause we dont want them to ever meet their teammatesfacetoface  The original experiment gave guards anonymity  by providing mirrored sunglasses and uniforms  But were taking it much further  Our study will take place in a room that is pitchblack JaredTheyll be taken into this room MichaelAh I would love to see how dark this room is going to betomorrow manYeah absolutely You readyIm ready Oh yeahman Right MichaelThis is uncomfortable  Despite the darkness  we will be able to see everything  thanks to infrared cameras  The second element is depersonalization  From the moment the subjects arrive  they will only be identified by number not name womanSo come on in  To eliminate the demand characteristics  we dont want our subjects to know what were studying Follow the sound of my voiceif you can  All theyll be told is that we are studying  how they solve puzzles in the dark There is another teamin a different location who is also solving a puzzleOkay  Because the words guard and prisoner  suggest certain expected behaviors  weve done away with them  and will simply give our participants an unseen  distantly located opposing team  We will measure the cruelty predicted  by the standard narrative  of the Stanford Prison Experiment  by giving our participants  a way to exercise the third element power What Im going to show you nextis the system by which you can send thema loud noise OkaySo if you want to  Weve armed the teams with a distractor button  that they can press to blast an extremely loud  jarring noise into the other teams room  Everyone will have a volume dial that ranges from level 1 to 12  and theyll be told that anything below a 7  should be safe for the other teams hearing And each personhas their own control Okay So they cant seewhat youre doing You cant seewhat theyre doingOkay  The intensity level they select  as well as the frequency with which they push the button  will be our indicator of how aggressive  the participants become in this situation Is it is it prettylike terrible to hear Well Ill give youa demonstration Hey Derek could you playlevel 3 for me loud discordant horn So thats a 3 Its pretty its pretty loudYeah Perfect  Participants will be told that when they  or a member of their team pushes a distractor button  the volume played in the opponents room  will be determined by the highest level selected  on any of their teammates dials This is to increase the feeling of diffused responsibility  The question is will any of these participants take advantage of these factors and act sadistically  Of course we would never want anyone  to actually be harmed in our experiments  so the other team  They dont exist  Instead Jared and I will be the ones  occasionally blasting the group with noise  at a safe level no higher than a 3  To see just how powerful the situation can be  we selected participants  who would not be predisposed to sadism  We screened our participants  using the Big 5 Personality Scale  The Personality Assessment Inventory  and picked those who scored the highest  in moral categories  like honesty and conscientiousness It looks likeyou know they should be ableto see each other But its pitchdark There are puzzle pieceson the table in front of you Thank you and once I leavethe room you may begin Okay here we go man 1 man 2 man 1 I definitely dont thinktheyre conscious of the control panelat this point NoTheyre trying to get focusedon the task here man 1 man 2 man 2 laughter man 2 We picked peoplewho were most likely to have these kindsof personalities man 1 laughs woman OhShe wants woman All right all man 1 highpitched squealwoman Did somebody do it already I didYeahOkay We should retaliateYeah retaliate now loud discordant horn all laugh horn blares laughter MichaelNow theyre not retaliating against that most recent buzz Shall we try again loud discordant horn  Despite the factors making it easy for them to do so  this team doesnt appear to be turning evil Now they are likejust deal with it Just ignore it and keepworking together Theyre not interestedin retaliating discordant horn blares  Over the course of the twohour study  we blasted them with noise 23 times woman laughs But they only pushed the button six times  and never above a level 5  They didnt seem to abuse their power Puzzle pieces down  What would happen if we introduced  demand characteristics  that encouraged them to act aggressively Your team has beenrandomly assigned an experimental condition Although the other team will continue workingon a puzzle your team will not Your only task is to operatethe distractors Also the other teams buttonshave been disconnected without their knowledge You will not hear any soundsif they buzz back at you We introducethe social roles where theres a little bitof power differential Were kind of mimicking theStanfordlike variables here Michael By now saying that the buzzer is their task  the participants may feel  a greater license to use it liberally  Similar to how instructing prison guards  in the original experiment to act tough  may have encouraged more use of force man 3 woman man 1  Even though they were given instructions  to distract the other team these participants instead  just started chatting with one another They know that they can bedistracting now but theyre not pushing thebutton No man 2 Oh Okay woman A couple of threes highpitched squeal Over the course of ten minutes  this group only pushed the button three times Why do you thinktheyre so uninterested in blastingthe other team Because we have individualswho have been selected really with that predispositionright These are individuals who shouldnt be interestedin retaliating  It was time to debrief the participants  on what we were actually studying MichaelIm going to turn the lights on Here I am Im Michaeland this is Jared Were going to debrief you onwhat was really happening today There are no other people You are the only four here atthis moment There was never another teamdoing anything man 1 This is a study related tothe Stanford Prison Experiment man 1 The standard narrativewe hear about that experiment is that peoplejust become cruel So yeah were trying to see ifwe get the nicest people we can and we give them completeanonymity and the ability to be cruelbut never encourage them to will they still do it And you guys didnt Did you have any suspicionsabout what we were studying or what was going on Right but I thinkthats good We just want to make sureyou dont think that what were reallylooking at is how high you turnyour own dial Thats reallywhat were looking at  It was time to bring in our second group of participants  who like the first groupwere screened to be individuals  with high morality characteristics Anything up to 7should be safe laughsYeah woman So once I leave  you can go ahead and get started woman 1 laughs Oh highpitched squeal Right off the bat she went to 7and pushed the button Yeah loud discordant horn highpitched squeal MichaelNumber twos pushing it at a 3 discordant horn blares woman 1 Okay here comes number two highpitched squeal Number two is stillat a volume 3 Michael This team seemed more willing to retaliate  Lets see what will happen if we continue buzzing them  Will they escalate their behaviors Derek lets blast them againNumber 3 loud horn Okay lets All right so two just pushedat a 3 But shes not touching the dial JaredShes not loud discordant horn woman 2Its just annoying blaring horn highpitched squeal all laugh  It was clear that participant number two  was really the only one hitting the distractor button  but it appeared that she only did it in retaliation  to our buzzes  So we decided to see what would happen  if we laid off man 1 Its been probablyfour or five minutes and we have not blasted themwith the noise and they haventplayed one either I have a feeling like if wenever played a noise in theirroom they would never touchthe distractor button JaredProbably not at this point  In the end we buzzedthis group a total of 44 times  and they buzzed us 38 times  37 of which came from number two  but always in retaliation and never above a 5 All right guysPuzzle pieces down  The situational factors did not seem to be sufficient  to make this group sadistic  It was time for phase 2 woman 1 Yeah Oh shehighpitch squeal It looks like its at 7 WowYeah shes Shes going nutsAt a 7 So number three believesthere is no other team That might explain why she wasjust going nuts on the button because she doesnt feel badabout it buttons clicking Okay theyre all pushingthe button a lot more And they were toldthis time that it was theironly task buttons clicking all laugh What a differencethis has made Just like in the StanfordPrison Experiment If you tell people that they have a certain taskto do theyll do it even if its going to meanthat theyve been broken The thing is they never hitupon what we really cared about which is turning the dialinto an unsafe level Yeah buttons click Michael Hello everyoneIm going to turn the lights onin this room woman 1Okay And slowlyAh it hurts you can look So hello Im Michaeland this is JaredHi Ill give you timeto adjust your eyes Today youve been partof a study where all we wanted was to see what would happenwhen we put people in a room and gave them that feelingof anonymity that comes from well if I crank my dial upreally high no one will knowits me So you have this opportunityto be cruel I thoughtI went nuts Like when the other personwas pressing Sure but thatsthats just inkind retribution As it turns outso far everyone stays in thatbelow 7 or under range YeahThis final phase was us trying to ramp upthe demand characteristics And I believe number one rightyou did say at one point Youve broken meI did it fine So I loved that phrasebecause it says I didnt want to do this but Im doing it because Ibelieve it was expected of me allThank you Thanks Michael After dismissing our participants  Jared and I sat down to discuss our results Really fascinating We brought in people who hadvery different personalities than those Zimbardo chose We put them in a situation thatdid not demand things from them And they behaved accordingto that personality I think we have some intriguingsupport for the idea that its more than justthe situation We really saw personalitykind of shine through For the most partthey seemed to be aware of where that line isYeah that they shouldnt crossand they didnt None of them did  It was now time to speak with the man himself  Dr Philip Zimbardo  who I worked with on last seasons episode  How to Make a Hero Okay Lisa Bearyou guys ready  For years Dr Zimbardo has responded to criticisms  of his famous study  always maintaining that they arent valid  I asked him about whether his study  is better seen as one on the power  of demands from authority  but he wasnt receptive to that idea I then told him about the study we ran to get his reaction I wanted to know what thesufficient conditions might be to make anyonedo something evil And we struggledto get that to happen We couldnt get anyoneto be cruel Just giving them anonymityand a dehumanized other and the powerto hurt that other they didnt takeadvantage of it  Well I mean maybe the problem was  heres a case where by picking people  who were extremely conscientious  extremely mindful  by selecting people who are high on compassion  high on mindfulness  you broke the power of the situation  In the Stanford Prison Experiment  we had I presume  a relatively normal distribution  We gave them six personality scales  And we picked people who in the scales  who were mostly in the midrange  In that situation  some people behave cruelly evilly  Not everybody but more of the guards than not  So again I think that your study is a demonstration of one way in which personality dominates situation Ah Where the personalities are  so I would say its a positive result  The personalities are special Where does this balance liebetween the personal the dispositionthe personality and the situationthe environment  No thats the big  thats the ultimate question  Where is you know how much of one  and how much of the other Right Zimbardo insiststhat demand characteristics played little rolein his subjects behavior Critics like Ben Blumsay they played a big role that what happenedwas what was asked for If thats true then the StanfordPrison Experiment like the classic Milgram studystill has an important lesson People are quick to be cruel if an authority figure suggeststhat doing so will serve a greater cause In our test we made sure thatsuch influences didnt exist And not one participantacted maliciously Personality rose abovethe situation Learning how that happensis vital if we want to improve conditionswhere power is involved So its great that this debateis still ongoing And look questioning methodsand interpretations is not a personal attack Its how we improveour confidence in what we know And thats how science works So stay curiousnever stop asking questions and as alwaysthanks for watching Hey Mind FieldMichael Stevens here There is so much moreto satisfy your hunger for psychological

more brain cells and a few moreand connect them all at a certain pointthe group itself will  be able to think and experience emotions and have opinionsand a personality and know that it exists How can such astonishing things be made fromsuch simple ingredients Well answering that questionmeans learning not only whowe are but more importantly how we are Today using whatneuroscientists know so far I am going to make my hometown function like a brain  all cheering applauding   ♪ A single brain cell is tiny both in size and abilities But when enough are togetherthey can do amazing things like be aware of themselves When the collective powerof a group working together is greater than the sumof their individual parts that is called emergence In a similar fashionwe as individuals are connected tothe people around us Those connectionsform communities thatwhen functioning properly can work togetherto accomplish amazing feats A great example iswisdom of the crowds Even if not a single personin a crowd knows the right answerto a question collectively they could allsomehow know the right answer In 1987 economistJack Treynor conductedthe Bean Jar experiment He asked 56 studentsto guess the numberof jellybeans in a jar Now as you can probably guess not a single one of themguessed the right answer But amazingly when he tookthe average of their guesses what he got was a number withinjust 3 of the real answer Now some peopleguessed way too high but others guessedway too low so all togethertheir errors balanced out and from a whole bunchof wrong guesses the true answer emerged What else can a crowd do If I got a bunchof humans together and had each one of themact like a brain cell turning on or off in responseto the actions of other people could I make a neural network like the one in our brain And if I had enough people could intelligence emotions a mind emerge  If I recruited every single person  in the country of China  and arranged them like neurons  would the result not only be a simple brain  but something that can think and feel  and be aware of its own existence Well this is the China Brainthought experiment first proposed by Lawrence Davisand later Ned Block Its never been done beforeand well unfortunately I dont have accessto everyone in China I made some callsand like a lot of them are busy But the first step is to seewhat a crowd in real life could even do This hasnt been donesuccessfully before but I want to blowa neural network up to the scale of a crowd And what better crowd to usethan one made of the people whose emergent propertiesmade me who I am today Thats right I am going hometo Stilwell Kansas  ♪  ♪  birds chirping  Michael For help designing the brain  we would make out of people  I recruited Chris Eliasmith  director of the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience  at the University of Waterloo So Chriswere headed south going down tothe heart of Stilwell  where I grew up Nice Were going to do somethinga little bit weird Um I want to create a brain  Right OK But with  a crowd of people It sounds like a challengefor sure I looked into it and I found that the roundwormhas a brain thats made up of only300someodd neurons  Thats right We can get 300 people and where better to getthese people to make a brain than my hometown of Stilwell This was the communitythat in many waysmade me who I am Michael This is all downtown Stilwell  Some of my earliest memories are from here This used to beand maybe still isa feed store and they would have snoconesduring the summer It was the most awesomedelicious thing ever But as you can see  a lot of corn is grown in Kansas  but around here the main thing that I saw being grown  was just sod Oh really Yeah Theres a famous sod farmaround here whose slogan wasHigh on grass   Chris laughs  It was prettypretty edgy for the time OK so back to the brainthat were gonna make You know building brains isin my job description I wrote a book called How to Build a Brain Michael Chris is known for is neural network  the Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network  or SPAUN which is one of the worlds most complex  computer simulations of the brain  It uses 66 million simulated neurons  to perform functions like counting reasoning  and image recognition  SPAUN is cuttingedge  but neural networks are nothing new  The first was made by Dr Frank Rosenblatt  of Cornell University in 1957  His network called the Perceptron  was designed for image recognition  and he hoped it would become capable of learning  just like a brain  But the project was only partially successful  and after some controversy fell by the wayside  It was only when researchers in the 1980s  came back upon Dr Rosenblatts work  and as computing power increased  that the field of artificial neural networks  came back to the mainstream  Today it is alive and well  SPAUN and even neural networks used in selfdriving cars  are expanding the possibilities of computer learning If I want to makea brain out of peoplewhere do I start Thats a good question I think the first thingwe want to do is figure out what we want our brain to do I would recommendsomething like vision Vision Lets makethis brain see Michael Before we can design the intricacies  of the brain were making  lets look at how visual processing works  Lets say we look at a cat  Light information from every point on the cat  lands on the retina  This information gets sent to our visual cortex  The visual cortex  is structured in layers  V1 through V6  Each of these layers are made up of neurons  activated by specific features  like lines angles and shapes  The features that are detected  are sent to the infratemporal cortex  which puts all the pieces of the image together  and we get our Eureka moment  where we recognize the object were looking at  what it means what feelings we have towards it I love cats But what should we haveour brain recognize We dont wantreally high resolution images or images that dependon too much detail  Ok so things like lettersand digits Lets say we use digits Ok  Ok I want to be the onewho draws a digit and then you will beon the output side You should be ableto determine what Ive drawn not because I showed itto someone and theytelephoned it back to you but becausethey processed itintelligently Thats what we needto figure out how were gonnashow an input to our people So we should takesome small number of them and put them at the frontas the retina and really just show them eacha little bit of the image So if for instancewere able to put like25 people in that kindof front row the input layerthen whatever image we show should be made upof 25 pixels  Exactly Right Twentyfive pieces Im gonna draw25 people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 See I can count These are our retina cells and each one isan individual person thats literally standinglike in a field What do they then do next They merely need to indicatewhether or not their cell is on or off  All right So they should start firing They should start spikinglike a neuron What could they doto indicate that theyre firing or not They could jump up and down they could wave a flag OK I like that When Chris and I use wordslike firing and spiking were talking abouthow brain cells neurons talk to one another by sending an electric messagefrom one cell to another Its calledan action potential and it travels down the axonof the cell When the ionic flowinto a brain cell reaches a certain threshold the cell will fire an electronicmessage down its axon So a neuroncan either be on or off Its either firingor its not firing What we need to findis a way for a person to be either on or off raising a flag or their handshould do the trick  To illustrate our visual input  I will be drawing a number from 0 to 9  onto a grid divided into 25 squares or pixels  Now each person or neuron will receive one pixel  If a neuron receives a pixel with writing on it  it will fire  The V1 layer identifies pixels in the retinal layer  that form particular lines in the number  and the V2 layer identifies particular combinations  of lines from V1 that form angles  What does V3 do V3 is more sensitive to color Were only working withblack and white in this case So youre saying we wont evenneed to have a V3 in our brain Were skipping V3 altogether All right sorry V3  So were gonna go straight to V4 Yeah Michael V4 neurons will fire  when their assigned combinations of angles  have been detected  At this point the basic shape of a number  is beginning to take form And so actually the next oneis called IT  Ooh And that stands for infratemporal cortex Michael Now dont worry  We havent forgotten V5 and V6  They exist theyre responsible  for higherlevel image processing in our brain  But for our demonstration we dont need them  We do however need the infratemporal cortex  which is the final layer needed for visual processing  in the brain were designing  Our IT will consist of ten neurons  representing the numbers 0 through 9  They will be looking at neurons in V4  and will only fire when their corresponding neurons fire  For example if one or multiple V4 neurons  representing the shapes of an 8 fire  the IT neuron representing the 8 will also fire  Voila We just recognized a number So what happens afterthe infratemporal layer So after thatI think thats where Ill be Its gonna be me making adecision about what digitI think was actually shown atthe end So I think were gonna needa couple hundred people so one question iswhere do you putthat many people I would love to usemy high school football field The question isis it gonna work  I am hopeful right now We got our work cut out forus Michael Knowing how we want to structure  our neural network it was now time for us  to head to my high school football field  where our brain will take form  I spent a lot of time here  impressing the world with my bodys prowess  at the clarinet OK so ChrisI brought you here because we need to talk about the actual logistics of gettingall these people together So heres the planas I see it Everyone is going to bewearing a shirt that is a different colorbased on what layer theyre in Were also gonna giveeveryone one of those um like Im runningin a marathon kind of  The big bibs Bibs Thank you Yes I knew that too You see Im always checking becauseChris is one of those nerds who doesnt knowwhat us sportostalk about Anyway the bibswill give every personan individual number so if something goes wrong we can targetthat one brain cell and say Are you damagedWhat do you need Take out the problem OK were hereon this 40 yard line I will be hereThis is gonna bethe input layer The retinal cells will beall in front of meall 25 of them You are gonna beway down in the end zoneon the output side And Im gonna beusing the scoreboard Ok So when youmake your prediction based on what you thinkthe brain has figured out well put that onthe Visitors side and Ill reveal the Home numberas what I really wrote  Sounds good So literally from here to that end zone is the amount of spacewere going to need for these hundreds of people to also havethe right eye lines Just have to make sure thatcommunication lines are open meaning that its easy to seewhoever you have topay attention to Michael Our human brain will have a couple hundred people  spread out in five layers  across half a football field  Every single participant will be assigned  to only react to certain neurons  in the layer ahead of them  And its complicated so their positions on the field  had to be carefully chosen so that every neuron  has a clear line of sight  to the neurons they are connected to In a way something will be bornon this field tomorrow  laughs   We shall find out Well find out All right  crowd chattering  Michael So what does it take to turn Stilwell into a brain  Well seven tents 550 chairs  twenty gallons of coffee three hundred flags  tshirt and hats  our drone operator Jeff  this cute little Gator  two hundred cinnamon rolls  and of course our medic Brian  Now all thats left is to pull this all off  A community is something that is bigger  that the sum of all of its parts and so is a brain Now today Im feelingpretty excited about the neural networkwere gonna build out of people because theres a zero percentchance of rain but a 100 chance of brain OK we better get started  The gates are open and our neurons are filing in  First theyre all given colorcoded tshirts  associated with the layer of the brain they will represent Just want go in the center Michael And then they will take to the field  to get in position MichaelYou all in the orange shirtsare the retina Your job is to sayIs there writing on my square or Not If your squarehas any writing or black marks on itraise your flagoh and stand up  Now Im sure all you megabrainiacs out there  remember every detail about how this brain  is going to recognize numbers  But just in case you dont heres a refresher  I will draw a number on a 25pixel grid  break the squares up and hand them out  to every person in the retina layer  The retinal neurons will only fire if they have writing on their pixel The people in the yellow shirts you guys are V1  Each V1 neuron will be watching  three retinal neurons in front of them  and fire only if all three  of their assigned retinal neurons fire  revealing lines that make up the number You guys are V2 Youre a bit more advanced Youre looking for combinationsof features that make for instance angles  The V2 neurons will be watching the V1 layer  and fire only if their assigned V1 neurons fire  revealing angles  V4 neurons will be looking at V2 neurons  Their firing reveals combinations of angles  that begin to form the number Finally the purple shirts You all areinfratemporal cortex Extremely important role not more importantthan the others though  Part of the ITs function is to inhibit  incorrect results it receives from the V4 layer  For example if V4 neurons are indicating  both a 6 and an 8  an 8 will outrank a 6 because an 8 has more features  Chris will determine the number by interpreting the results from the IT layer  Got it Good Because its happening now Michael over loudspeakerAll right It is time for meto draw my first numeral Stand by There it is Now its time to distributethese pixels to the photoreceptorsin the retina 25 24 19 13 All right I have distributed the input to the retina layer Is everyone ready  all cheering applauding  Three twoone think  And theyre off The retina layer has fired  passing off signals to V1  V2 sees V1 firing and also fires  cuing V4 and IT  Theres a lot of flags on the play folks Look at all this processing Good work stay up Im now walking back to Chris where he will tell mewhat you guys have processed All right Chrisit actually happened way faster than I thought It took me foreverto get over here They were already donethinking It was really interestingto watch We had a little bit of noisein the system for sure because we actually kind ofhave two answers at the end So Im going to be doingsomething that brains do which is kind ofmake a guess sometimesbased on the best evidence MichaelAll right Chris What numeraldo you think I drew ChrisI think you drew a 3 Lets get that upon the Visitors scoreboard The numeral I truly drew was a 3  all cheering applauding  ChrisNice work There was some noisein the system I think we can perfect thisa little bit because it wasnta confident 3 but Chris did stillget it right And by ChrisI mean all of you Michael We gave each of our IT neurons a clear tube and plastic balls  to make their job easier  Every time they see one of the neurons theyre watching fire  they put a ball in their tube  If a neuron theyre inhibited by  has more balls than they do  they stop firing MichaelOur model had a mistake You should have beeninhibited by 254 meaning that if 254 is firing and puts a ball in the tube  you just sit down OK But we didnt have 254written down into your code Im gonna do that right now  With that kink worked out  it was time to try again Take that oneThank you24 MichaelThree two one go MichaelOoh Theres not much happening in V2 and V4 Or IT for that matter Looks like our brain died Michael Something definitely went wrong  The processing stopped in V2 So I think our brain broke Not a single person in V4 or the infratemporal cortex has been activated Chris Seems like somethingvery strange happened when the lightwent through the lensand got to the retina OK but what you really mean tosay is that I handed the pixelsout to the wrong neurons  Its lookin that way Wow who would have thought that the worstworkingpart of the machine would be the actual peoplewho get to be people  and not brain cells I know right OK I thinkIm gonna do an 8 this time And Im gonna put itkind of up in this corner or along that side This is pretty weirdits not centered its not filling upthe whole space Lets see if our braincan recognize it  Each pixel of our image needs to go  to a particular retinal neuron  To make sure I didnt mess it up again  we put numbers on the back of each one Is everyone ready   all cheer  OK Three two one go MichaelOh yeah WhoaThat was fast Michael Blink and youll miss it so lets take a break  because this is the Mind Field Play of the Game  The 8 I drew contained 13 pixels  and bam the 13 retinal cells connected to those locations are firing  Now thats what I call a sensation  V1 reads the formation perfectly  They dont even know it but each one firing  means a horizontal vertical  or diagonal line has been caught  Now look at neuron 40s speed  Its sensitive only to a horizontal line  low and to the right which my 8 had  If retinal cells 23 24 and 25 all fire together  such a line has been sensed and watch thisboom  Champion reflexes there folks  If the V1 neurons a V2 player is watching fire  they stand and that means that the lines V1 caught  made some corner angle  Standing V4 neurons are shapes made by those corners  but it all comes down to IT  A bunch of them fire  Lots of numbers contain the shapes I drew  but there can only be one MVP  and dang look at this teamwork  3 is inhibited by 8  0 is inhibited by 8  If 8 is getting this much activity  sit down and let that neuron score  This my friends is what we in the cognition sports biz  calla gr8 play Chris over loudspeakerThe purple people neurons make me think thatyou wrote an 8 An 8 Lets put an 8up on the scoreboard And as it turns outthe numeral that I did write was an 8  all cheering applauding   Nice job That was good Michael This was our first definitive success  Now its time to really put the system to the test So Im gonna draw a 1 but then Im gonna adda line down here and Im gonna doa dot right there And were gonna see ifthat noise trips up our brain Three two one go My guess is a 1 The number that I drew wasin fact a 1  cheers applause  7and Im gonna puta line through it Go Oh yeah Man these people are good ChrisThe brain thinksits just saw a 7 I wrote a 7   cheers applause  Nice work Nice work Michael With two successful results in a row  for the last test I want to see what will happen  if I really mess with our brain Im not even going to drawa number instead Im going tofill in every single cell This means thatevery single neuronin the retina will fire will stand up and waveLets see what happens My prediction of courseits gonna look like an 8 because an 8 is a numeral thatfills in a lot of the cells Are you all ready   all cheer  Good  Chris are you ready Ready MichaelAll right Im ready Three two one go ChrisWhat  laughing    all cheering  Michael Look at that  Michael Holy cow  Chris laughs  It looks to me like youessentially opened up the eye and shone a laserright into it Right yeahSo what I did isI didnt even draw a numeral I just scribbledall over the whole thingI filled in every single cell  So what does the brain think that I drew The 8 I had no idea the inhibitionwould work that well We were able to singleall of that mess down into just one guess and it really wasthe smartest guess Right it was the one withthe most features in it MichaelCongratulations tothe entire infratemporal cortex V4 V2 V1 retina You guys have been amazingGreat work  cheers applause  Today I was a neuron My favorite partabout the brain was that it actually worked My favorite partwas just the whole experience doing sciencemeeting cool people Its just a really goodsimulation of howthe brain works and it was just really coolto take some informationfrom that MichaelAnd as always thanks forbeing a brain  all cheer  Michael Our smalltown brain  did work as predicted Made up of only a couple hundred neurons each one with no ideawhat number I was drawing it was nonetheless ableto process the image and determinethe correct answer We created a livingbreathing model of a part of the human brain And our demonstrationwas a new way to illustrate and share how the human brainprocesses visual information We were able to watch itprocessthink in real timeand thats amazing Its success shows what we canachieve by working together and we only useda small fraction of the number of neurons foundin an actual human brain So imagine how powerful the connections ofnot a few hundred but a hundred billion human neurons could be Now interestingly a hundred billion peopleis about how many humans have ever existedin the history of Earth There are only a few billionalive right now so I guess that meansget procreatingplease I want to make a biggersuperhuman mind No Id like to thankevery neuron from my hometown of Stilwell and the entire communitythat supported us Because without themall working together none of thiswould have been possible And as always thanks for watching  ♪   no audible dialogue  ♪,158.89447236180902,MichaelCongratulations,0.0,1.0,rA5qnZUXcqo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA5qnZUXcqo
Moral Licensing,2018-12-05T17:01:02Z,28.466666666666665,2823871,0,Moral psychology isnt alwaysan easy thing to study First of alljust using a survey to ask peoplewhat they think is moral doesnt always reveal what theywould do in real life An experiment that actuallyputs people in what feels likea real scenario may get more realistic results but researchers must alwaysbalance the benefits of what we could learn with the safety and wellbeingof the people they study Secondly what we learn frommoral psychology experiments doesnt always make humanslook good For example today were goingto look at moral licensing the theory that when you dosomething good you subconsciously feelyouve earned a license to then do something bad  Ive been working with Dr Kyle Stanford  from the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science  at the University of California Irvine  on a way to observe moral licensing in the wild So I want to see moral licensingin effect I want to see peoplewho have been led to believe through their own actionsthat theyre good Use that feeling to do bad The thing to keep in mind its like peopleare keeping tabs and they give themselves creditfor the moral the good thing they did But none of that is happeningconsciously right So we shouldnt imaginethat a person whos engaged in moral licensing is askingthemselves in their head Right pulling outtheir scorecard what should I beDoes it make me a good person But it is going onand they dont experience it They dont know that itshappening Right I think were going to learna lot today I say we go get started Lets do it Lets do it Michael So heres how the moral licensing test  we designed is going to work  First were going to take this beautiful park  and for the purposes of science  throw trash everywhere  Next weve hired some unsuspecting actors  who think theyre going to film a public service announcement  about the park Hey Jake Hey manHi Nice to meet youNice to meet you  Once theyve arrived  it will be obvious that the trash is a problem We just need to clean up thislittle alleyway right here  Will they do a good deed and earn some moral credit  by volunteering to help pick up the trash or not  And to make everything feel more real  we did have them film our fake PSA Forget the concreteand the heat Relax in over16000 square feet Of outdoor spacethat cant be beat Right outside your door Right outsideyour door Right outside your door  After shooting the PSA  each participant will be asked to wait in a separate area  for some final paperwork  There our confederate Cameron who appears to be homeless  will ask them for money  Meanwhile Dr Stanford and I will be watching  behind the scenes to observe how our subjects react  So will our participants  keep their subconscious moral scorecards balanced  by giving money when they didnt clean  or feeling like they dont need to give money if they did HeyMakaylo Makaylo nice to meet you  First up in our demo was Makaylo  We used our actual Mind Field crew  as the crew of the fake PSA  who are overwhelmed with the task  of cleaning up all the trash We normally sort ofnever ask this but weve got like all this stuffthat were trying to clean up Im going to grab some glovesI was wondering would you help me Im sorryLets do it Lets do it All three of uscan tripleteam it and we can get this thinggoingLets do it Lets do it Yeah this is justwhat we wanted to do today It looks like someonehad a good time though Michael All rightso picking up the trash How do you thinkthats currently sitting with our actor Hes thinking of himself ashaving done a good deed that he didnt need to dothat he didnt have to do Right And so the moral creditis high Michael Then it was time to shoot our PSA manTake it away Forget the concreteand the heat Relax in 16000square feet manThat was great All right man Hey thanks so muchCool No problem man  We compensated our participants for the PSA in small bills  so they would have plenty to give the homeless man  should they choose to do so Heres 50Thank you thank you  Then we asked them to wait in a nearby tent  for their final paperwork  Will Makaylos good deed be enough moral credit  for him to pass on helping the homeless guy All right Cameronthis is Michael You can go ahead Whats up Whats upHi Are you with this Yeah Im just waitingfor someone to help me out here Could you help me outwith like a dollar or two Just I can goto the vending machine Sorry my man I aintgot nothing but 20 bills on meright now Oh I got nothingbut 20 bills laughs You sureYeah man All right well MichaelWere going to go talk to him Hey Makaylo HeyThanks for waiting Im Michael Nice to meet youNo problem Makaylo This is KyleNice to meet you Nice to meet youMakaylo We really appreciateyour help today I just saw Did a guy come byYes What did he ask For a dollar billMichael Oh for a dollarbill Yeah Did you give him money NoWhatd you tell him I just told himI didnt have anything So Im going to debrief youon what were doing here today Were doing a psychologicalexploratory experiment on whats calledmoral licensing Were looking at the correlationbetween people who do volunteer to helppick up the trash and how generous you are later to a homeless personwho walks by Interesting Now you just exhibitedthe exact pattern of moral licensing right In that you had alreadydone a good deed So I was good for the dayRight Michael Did we just see  moral licensing in effect  Perhaps  Lets see what our other subjects do Here let me just have youhang out here Is there anybodythat can help us clean up this Im going to go look aroundAll right Okay so this is Alex And Alex is just messingwith his stuff KyleHes either not really noticing or pretending not to notice But all of that is just fine The question iswhat he then goes on to do Michael So Alex didnt help pick up trash  Will his guilt put him at a moral deficit  and therefore motivate him to give money to the homeless man Hey Can you spare some moneyMaybe help me out You want a buckA buck Yeah Can I give you a buckIs that cool CameronThats more than cool man I just got paid to be here ReallyYeah Helping to shoot a PSA yeah Where do I sign up Thank youAll right take care All rightVery interesting I do wonder if he felta little bit of guilt We got it in the oppositedirection which was going to bethe hard thing to doYeah Im very happy about this MichaelNext we have Jake So Im on set doing a PSA shoot MichaelHey hes doing a vlog And I get hereand it appears that someone had awhat could only be described as a trash party I mean they just threw trashliterally everywhere all over where they wantto shoot So Im going to go help thempick up some of the trash First Im going to make surethat I document that Im a helper I would also like to point outthough that he has not helped Kyle RightHes gone back into the tent And I wonder when it comesto moral licensing does this play an effect I can check the boxNot only am I good but the world knows Im good Now this is somethingwe havent seen before MichaelI love this I love that he got creditfor helping but didntRight Whats interestingbut hard to know is how thatll look to him whether hell see himselfas having done a good deed or seeing himself as kind ofskated on the obligation because he didntreally help Hey do you thinkyou could spare some money maybe help me out Here manHeres a dollar ReallyYeah Go for it All right youre a good manThank you We were really curious as wewere watching this all unfold because you agreed to helpand then you recorded a video about how you weregoing to help but by the time all thatwas over you didnt need to help It was all cleaned up RightSo we were wondering did you feel likeyou had helped or not No I didnt have time to And you didnt feel guilty Like ooh I kind of likegot out of helping No I didnt feel badabout that I would have definitelypicked up trash Erins likely to be thinkingthat shes doing a good deed Yeah Could you maybe help me outgive me some money Im sorry I dont haveanything on me here NoThey wont let me OhYeah That was greatYes we have a couple good illustrationsin both directions Michael We seemed to have witnessed moral licensing  at play in several cases  But of course as with any demonstration like this  our results werent always cutanddry Im going to go tryto clean this up myself and then Gotcha Yeah yeah  Some of the participants both didnt help clean  and declined to give our homeless man money Could you maybespare some change I just want to goto the vending machine Uh  However they did find other ways to help hiim  that could qualify as a good deed They have snacks maybe Im goingto take a pop laughsOkay Do you want a sodaor something Yeah thatd be Do you maybe have a littlemoney as well I dont sorry ButOkay which onedo you want So what was goingthrough your mind when you made the decisionnot to give some of the cashthat we know you had to the man who was asking You know theres just likea whole bunch of stereotypes about homeless people And you dont knowwhat youre getting into Michael And we had a couple subjects  who both volunteered to clean and gave money Do you need anyassistance If you wouldnt mindthatd be really helpful MichaelOh hes offering to help Oh Do you need any helpOh would you mind Kyle Oh she just offeredShe offeredMichael Shes volunteered  These were the only two participants  who did good deeds at both opportunities man Thank you so much for thehelp Diana Of course Do you maybe have some sparechange Here you go Thanks a lotBest of luck Here you go Hope it helpsThank you so much Youre welcome MichaelAll right lets go talk to her Another goodgood person What motivated youto give the man money I actually tend to give peoplemoney often I dont know if thatsthe best thing Interesting  So two people both cleaned and donated money  But everyone else either cleaned and didnt give  or didnt clean but gave in some form What do you thinkabout how everything went Well it was really interestingI would like to do it with manymore people But I think we sawthe phenomenon right We saw the thing happen Something we werent expectingactually is sort of the gap betweenwhat people did and what they saidabout why they did it YeahRight And thats something I mean social psychologygenerally has learned to be very suspiciousof peoples rationales or justificationsfor their own behavior But these actually fitkind of nicely You could see people strainingto defend themselves if they didnt do a good deedthat was open to them Right And then a lot of peoplewho did good deeds had the Well of course thats whatanyone would do attitude RightMichael Yeah  I believe our study  successfully created the conditions  for moral licensing to emerge  It was a great first step  towards taking this kind of study  out of the lab and into the real world  But of course many people already have a philosophy  about giving to the homeless that might be stronger  than the impact of a good deed they do  So were not done yet Now heres what I wantto do next okay We learned a lotof lessons today and I think one of them is thatwhen the scenarios you put people in are scenarios they may haveexperienced before that can affectthe results If someone did or did notgive money to a homeless person they can easilyexplain it away as Well I never door I always do I want to find a scenario that we dont find ourselvesin very often that we havent createda philosophy or identity about ourselvesaround For instance allowing someone elseto take the blame for something that you did Because that seemslike a scenario where all of us would saywe would never let that happen But if we build up significantmoral license in that person will they actuallydo something that none of us would ever wantto admit that we would do Are you down to plansomething else I am down indeed All right lets do it Michael Kyle and I developed a different sort of test  to really try and pinpoint moral licensing  by putting our participants in a situation  theyd likely never been in before  and thus had no preconceived assumptions about  A test that might make people behave in a way  that could surprise even themselves Welcome everybodyThank you for coming today In a nutshellwhat were doing is were going to see if we canget people to do something that almost all of uswould never admit were capable of doing to allow a childto take the blame for a crimethey committed And were going to do thatby using moral licensing Early on in the demonstrationor experiment theyre going to havean opportunity to donate money  To really up the value of their moral action  we will tell the participants that for every dollar they give  of the money theyve made today  100 times that amount will be given to childrens hospitals  So if they donate just a dollar today  theyll feel like they gave 100 Were giving them a chance thereto do something morally good that will hopefullymake them feel like they dont haveto step up and keep this innocent childfrom taking the fall for their crimes later on They just think theyre comingto test out really cool VR equipment at the YouTube Spacein Los Angeles  Our participants will think that theyre here to focustest  a new kind of VR technology  But what they dont know  is that everyone else is a hired actor  including the child Noah laughs  Participants will be told that security  is of the utmost concern  and not to let anyone into the room Just be sure not to letanybody in because the doorsyou need a key card  But while waiting  someone will knock on the door knock  If they break protocol and open the door  the man they let in will steal some of the VR equipment manYou guys have a good day  Even though the participant let the thief in  Noah will volunteer that he did  and be blamed for what the participant knows  they were responsible for And Noah you let him inYeah Yeah I let someone in Michael Putting participants into difficult moral scenarios  needs to be done carefully  so we have a psychiatrist on call  Now with all the details in place its time to begin All right Noahwe are starting now womanAll right Head on inGo ahead and grab a seat  Our first participant is Kimberly  Kimberly gave 1 of her earnings from the study  which means she thinks that shes donated 100 woman Just be sure that if you guys  need to go to the bathroom or anything like that  be sure to let someone know Because no onewithout a key card should be coming back inOkay Gotcha All right Noahyou can cue your mom to leave mother Just stay thereNoah Okay Michael To get rid of any eyewitnesses  Noahs mom left the room to go get a coffee door closesHave you done this No Im excitedNo Oh niceHave you NoOh Im excitedboth chuckle knock on door MichaelOh theres the knocking So our thief is tryingto get in The question iswill Kimberly let him in knocking persists Is somebody knocking I love those suspicious eyes man Thank you so muchOh yeah youre welcome Oh thank youyoure welcomeAwesome You guys havinga good day Yeah You guys havea good day Thank you All right I think we arefinally ready for you Okay Ill have you do you guys knowif there was anybody who wasnt supposedto be in here Yeah I let someone in Okay Um stay right here Ill be right back Okeydokey door closes What happened I dont know Kimberly didnt speak up Well get to seethe full escalation womanYeah I was gone for maybelike three minutes and one of the sets is gone I mean sighs the amount of technology The protocolsthat are kept in there You just opened the doorand let someone in Yeah Mmmm Oh my gosh My heart rates going I meanI didnt know so I think Kimberlys reallynervous to say anything KyleShe hasnt decided at this point that shes going to let himtake the blame But shes seeinghow it plays out Michael To further heighten the situation  and to prolong the opportunity  for Kimberly to come clean  we sent in security How old are you sonTwelve Youre 12 All right just havethe rest of the employees stay out of the hallway givethe officers room to come in Okay we have to keepthings safe because just in case theressomething else going on here Can you tell mewhat you saw Is there somethingthat you saw or that you noticedthat was I literally just came in likefive minutes ago and there was just dudescoming in and out SoOkay The guy that hes describinghe was coming in and out There was like a couple guyscoming in and out so Noah But there were tons ofguys coming in and outYeah All right Im going to haveCalvin take the kid away Okay sorry but Mom you and the son are goingto need to come with me okay Yeah still have themcome in Michael Kimberly was given many chances to tell the truth  but she said nothing  letting poor Noah take the blame motherWhy One little thingto follow NoahSorry Can I go Like everybody left Im not going to be hereby myself We got to get in there Okay lets go Kyle Are you KimberlyI am Yeah Im gonna debrief you on whatsbeen happening here today Okay There is no VR experience Im Michael Stevens Im thehost of a psychology program And this is Kyle StanfordHe works at UC Irvine in Philosophy and LogicYes Of course Now you gave a donation today Yeah Howd you feelabout that I was likelet me help out When the child actortook responsibility for letting a person in were you at allconflicted about the factthat he was taking full responsibilityfor everything I was literally likejust frozen I was just frozen And then I was kind of like I feel so uncomfortableright now I like just kind of let himsay whatever he wanted And I assume like if somebodyactually took anything theyd be like hey yourethe one that let the guy in  In Kimberlys case  she may have been displaying moral licensing  Kimberly donated  and that might have given her the moral credit  to then not accept blame KyleIf shes not being insincere shes not lying Shes asking herself likeand convincing herself shes utterly typicalwe all do that What subjects are most likelydoing is confabulating in a way to defend whateverbehavior they engage in especially if they decidedto let Noah take the fall What I love is thatconfabulation  Some participants gave no donation knock on door  and subsequently followed the order not to open the door manGuys please My hands are fullI got to get this in there My boss told me to knocking persists Please guys  This is Zeus  He chose to donate 5  which means he feels like hes responsible  for a 500 donation Hey guys Did you was there anyone in here who didnt haveone of these key cards Yes Sorry I let someone in Okay I Wait wait waitI will be right back Miss that was me Dont take the blame for meIt was me  I thought he worked here Okay um just stay right here guys I will be right back Michael Even though Zeus donated money  he still did what many of us would consider the right thing  he confessed  Situations like this can be difficult  We dont always like what we learn about ourselves  In fact one of the participants  who donated the largest amount  allowed Noah to be removed by security  and asked to not be included in this episode  Our last participant was Michael  who did not donate manHey Hello I got a box out here manI cant hello Thank you man Im amazed that no one has askedthe guy for a badge Right Was there someonein here This guy just came in He was banging on the doorUhhuh Came in picked something upand then he walked out Okay UmI was drawing did he have a badge I dont knowI let him in so I let him inI dont know what happened He was bangingon the door  Michael initially confessed  his behavior in line with moral licensing  But Noah spoke up giving Michael an out  Will Michael stick to the truth Oh here we goOh okay He let the guy in Son can you tell mewhat happened Yeah a guy was knockingon the door and he said Can I please come inSomething about his boss And then security guardYou said Guy was banging on the doorsaid his boss Opened the door for himHe comes in here he takes somethingand then he walks out security guardAnd Noah you let him in NoahYeah security guard Okay youopened the door and let him inOkay What must be racing throughMichaels head right now Why is this kidIts very hardto imagine This is a very strangesituation Michael Obviouslya regular person to be in I think youre just thinking Why is this kidsaying he did it KyleTrying to figure it out Yeah I thinkat this point you and your mom are goingto need to come with me because were going to needto talk to the police because he openedthe door and he was not supposedto open the door and he opened up the doorIf youd just listen I tell youjust listen I promise were rightMom come with me Promise Just keep your hands to yourselfand do what I ask you to do God MichaelWe should go in Right What made it difficultto come forward and admit that you were the onewho opened the door I felt uncomfortablethat something was stolen one Two that this kid was goingto take the blame I mean I needed to step upand be accountable if I opened the door But it was just didnt quiteknow what was going on in that scenario there Michael Michaels behavior shows us  just how complicated moral reasoning is  That even when we want to do the right thing  it doesnt take much for us to step back  and abandon that sense of morality if and when  we are given an out So Kyle I was pretty surprisedby how far so many people were willingto let the wrong blame game go Viewers may wellbe sitting there judging the people who didntjump up to take responsibility But I think the kind of evidencewere gathering shows that its much morepossible than you think to get regular peopleto do things that they immediatelyfeel regretful about Another kind of lessonI think we get here is to remind ourselveshow sensitive all of us are to features of the situation even if we feelin our heart of hearts like theres no way we couldever have wound up doing itYeah That is probablythe numberone lesson and Im so grateful to theparticipants we had here today who helped us illustrate thatbecause withoutthe illustrations its just a wordin a textbook Right We are all capableof doing things wed never expect ourselvesto do And the choicesthat you make can have less to dowith how good or bad you are as a person and more to do withhow youve acted recently Now that mightsound unfortunate but we areimperfect creatures And thats nothingto be ashamed of because we are also curious And the more we learnabout why and how we make the moral choicesthat we do the better well be ableto tackle difficult questionsin the future And as always thanks

The Origins of Disgust,2018-12-05T17:00:28Z,12.733333333333333,1013999,34024,Being impressed by the cognitiveabilities of a chimpanzee isnt just good for themit is good for us because it helps us learn aboutour own evolutionary history Comparing the psychologyof humans to the psychologyof other primates is a great way toilluminate what it is wemaintained lost or changed as our brains divergedfrom other primates Now Im really excitedright now because inthe spirit of sharing The Primate Research Institutehas agreed to show me some of the other waystheyre learning about us by studying thosewho are almost us  Im heading to the parasite lab to meet up  with associate professor Andrew McIntosh  and doctoral student Cecile Serabian  Their work with Japanese macaques has led them to theorize  that primates feelings of repulsion or disgust  could have served a protective purpose in our evolution  To study disgust we will be working with  one the most famous disgust inducers poop Andrew Cecile thank youfor meeting up with me I can now tell people thatmy time in Japan was crappy both chuckle Andrew Just likeevery day for us So tell me why is therea bunch of poop on the table Because we were studyingthe social behavior and parasite infectionof the macaques Cecile continues Right If we want to say that humansare somehow especially hygienic or disgusted by those kinds ofobjects that might make us sick Its quite difficultto separate whether thats an evolutionaryresponse to something or just a culturalphenomenon that wevekind of created on our own MichaelNow these are clearly toys Theyre made of plastic These lookkind of different Okay so you have differenttypes here on the table This is the typefor carnivores its not the type of primates Primates have a longshapetype of poop Its called type 9 So those are allWait poops have numbers both chuckleI only know number 2 Why make play poop when youhave plenty of chimps out theregiving you real poop to use Ah So theres no odoror texture hereYeah exactly And what differencesdid you see Cecile continues Ah so its like a surfaceto put the food on top of They would avoid the replicaYes Cecile continues MichaelOh really Right right If you expose a bunchof individuals to a rangeof different kinds of avoidance experimentswe found that those individuals thatare much more hygienic actually were exhibitinglower infection so It sounds like a reallystrong argument in supportof the idea that we evolved an emotion like disgust  or a behavior like avoidanceof infectiouslooking stuff Mmhmm Because it had an advantage You get infected lessAndrew Thats right So you have some kindof experiment for me YepIs it safe Lets seeDont play that wayall laugh  Cecile and Andrew wanted to show me just how hardwired our sense of disgust is Cecile There you go Okay Those are edible Yes those are edibleMmhmm Im just going to place onein each of the holes hereOkay If you are ready to eat themjust try to reach out for them Okay Okay Good Good What do I do onceI pull the treat out You will tell uswhether you are ready toeat it or not basically Oh okay So youll put one in thereOne goes here Sure One goes hereOkay And one goes there All right Im going tostart right in the middle Hmm All right so I might justblow on this before I eat it but I feel prettyready to eat it YeahBecause what I felt was dry and it was solidit was like a foam Watch OkayOh its really goodIts got kind of a coffee taste So far so good Im going to go to the left No I dont want this one OkayWhoa you still went for it I still pulled it out sniffing What was it So Im just goingto set it down Okay Alright it smellsits kind of fishy All right now chuckles knowingly I okay Ill tell you whatthat was disgusting interms of how it felt but when I see the color I seethis kind of bright green color that makes me feel lessdisgusted actually because its sort of a funcolor and it reminds me that it probablyisnt truly contaminated But this is the one thatIm least likely to want to eat Even stronger than the visualcues or the olfactory cues it seemed that that touchingsome substrate like this gave us the strongestaversive response Yeah So the first one you touched was this piece of foam hereYeah So yeah its basically drySolid Um then I think youwent here and thatis called konnyaku AndrewYeah konnyaku is a kind ofstarchbased gelatin which is part ofthe cuisine here You said it smelled fishyso in here you probablyhave parts of seaweed Yeah right thats wherethats coming from Its soft a bit wetbut not very Its not sticking to meNot sticky yeah And the last one here waswhat maybe kids in the 90s including myselfwere playing with A slime toy Which is likeslimy and sticky And thisits just so gooey Well and the fact that itspink makes it so much more fun than if it was like brown Mmhmm Now the research youredoing with macaques is that somethingI could observe Wed be willing to take youout to the macaque habitat and we could run some of thesesimilar experiments with them for you to observeOoh I would love to Yeah  Ceciles work with macaque monkeys on Koujima Island  led her to develop an experiment that she and Andrew have been running on the macaques here atthe Primate Research Institute  They want to know if macaques avoid feces  because a feeling of disgust evolved in order to reduce  the risk of their exposure to parasites Andrew And here they areMichael And here they are Oh look at thatthe babies are so cute Here its feeding time almostMmhm Which is a good timefor an experiment Yeah were a bit luckythey didnt eat thatmuch in the morning so hopefully theyll have thatextra motivation to participate And were going to tryto play a bit withthe value of the food so well start with theirregular monkey chowRight Which they see a couple timesa day on a daily basis And then well see whathappens when we introducethat nice tasty peanut Cecile speaking Michael Right And so Imassuming they like peanuts Right soThey dont like peanutsin or on poop Well hopefully wellfind that out today Michael Okayso it looks like Andrew is dumping the um CecileThose are real feces that he is going to pairwith the replica feces that we have seen in the laband a control brown wood chip Michael Near each otherCecile Yes near each other Aha all right Let the games beginYeah  For the first trial Andrew places monkey chow on the control block of wood  the replica feces and the real feces  Whether or not the macaques eat it may indicate their level of disgust Michael Theyre lookingnow here comes one Michael No oh ohCecile Yeah CecileNo hes smelling the wood chip MichaelHe smelled the wood chipthe monkey chow fell off of it Cecile Yes MichaelIs he gonna eat it No I thinkregular old normal foodon poop is just its a hard sell Andrew over radio MichaelShelled peanuts okay Cecile So thatson the fake poopMichael Yep MichaelThats on the real poopCecile Yeah MichaelAnd thats on the wood blockCecile Yes  This time around Andrew introduces peanuts which the macaques really love Will this special treatoverride their inner instincts Oh oh theyrealready running in both Ooh Michael But he threw it And hes washing it nowHes washing it All right herecomes another one Oh he went for the poop one Cecile YeahMichael laughs Michael The first onehe just wants it to roll He doesnt even wantto have to carry itCecile In the water This is rolling so theydo some of those behaviors And now hes washingit in the water Cecile YeahMichael Is it clean enough Oh still gotta roll That was incrediblebecause the peanuts thatwere just on the wood chip those went straightinto monkey mouths  Was this an aberration  Andrew reloaded the peanut baits to find out Michael DecoyCecile A female isapproaching Michael Yep here she is She smells it firstand then and then Cecile Smells it againMichael Believes it eats it Cecile On the fakeMichael That wason the fake yeah Very cool Now she already ate offthe decoy and it was safe She hasnt oh she putthe control right in her mouth Cecile YesMichael And shes goingto wash the real feces Cecile Yeah And she went forthe real feces last Yes she did Michael Shes gota baby with her so I really hopeshe cleans that Cecile Or maybe thatsthe disadvantage shes carrying a babyshe cannot afford likecleaning everything Yeah Im reallyamused by how theyvisually recognize feces I mean were far awayits hard for me to tellYes but they can see that shapeor texture Be waryYeah  Over the course of several rounds of the experiment  the monkeys would eat off of the control  wash food from the replica and be extremely hesitant  towards anything that touched poop  The macaques demonstrated a clear and strong sense of disgust that was driving their decisionmaking and potentially keepingthem safe from pathogens  With the experiment complete Dr McIntosh returned topside  so we could discuss our findings So did you enjoythe view from up here MichaelThey did exactly what wetalked about earlier Ready to avoid parasiteinfested potential things Yeah I mean itspretty clear theres nota complete hesitation to pick up thingson actual feces but the reactions thatthe monkeys give when they do so is just so clearly differentthan when they are pickingthings off the ground or off the control itemsthat they have here Yeah yeah in factI you know I only sawa few trials here but as soon as the peanutor the monkey chow onthe feces is picked up and they realize thatthe feces is coming with it its a sticky substanceand that was when theirrevulsion got larger It almost seemed like theymight be absentmindedly goingI dont care and something deeper in themwas like you should care youshould throw this Yeah roll it wash itso it makes sense froman evolutionary standpoint Well Cecile Andrewthank you again so much forletting me come out here to see a primateexperiment in action This was really phenomenalThank you both Youre welcomeThanks for

The Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis,2018-12-05T17:00:07Z,24.366666666666667,20620156,331509,clangs This is Inuyama Japan a historic city home to Japans oldestoriginal wooden castle It is also hometo Kyoto Universitys Primate Research Institute  Here a group of chimpanzees have been trained  to play a game that exposes something shocking  about their memories  This is going to blow your mind  Here is how it works  Take a look at these numbers  1 2 3  Remember where they are  because theyre about to disappear  Can you point to where each number used to be  in numerical order  Probably Its pretty easy  1 2 3  But what if we make it harder  Get ready to point to where each number was in order  now  If you feel like you didnt have enough time  to memorize the screen thats fine  Its nothing to be ashamed of  Or is it  Here is a chimpanzee taking exactly that long  to memorize the same arrangement  Nailed it  Each of these puzzles is completely new  to the chimpanzee  but just a glance is all it needs  to completely capture all the numbers  How can a chimpanzees memory  be so much better than ours  Well one theory is that we humans  are worse at this task because we can talk What makes humans differentfrom other animals Well one thing is language We have the cognitive ability to communicate not just aboutwhats happening now but also about what did happenand what could happen We can tell storiesand its awesome But if language is so good why didnt any other animaldevelop it like we did  A good approach to this question  is one that looks at how we are different  from those who were almost us  Around 7 million years ago  there were no chimpanzees and there were no humans  But there were CHLCAs  an acronym which stands for  ChimpanzeeHuman Last Common Ancestor  Like us CHLCAs didnt have  great natural offenses or defenses  protective shells or claws fangs or venom  So living in the safety of the trees was great  Those who stayed became the chimps we know today  But for reasons were still not quite sure of  some of the CHLCAs decidedto venture down to the savanna  Without appropriate physical abilities  things like cooperation imagining new strategies  and the assigning of roles were necessary for survival  all of which are easier if you have  a rich collection of symbols  that can refer to things across time  language  Many different types of creatures emerged  with varying adaptations  But today only one member of the family remains  Us Language as we know it may havebeen one of the strategies that kept us alivein the savanna But where did it move in The brains of thosewho developed language and those who didntarent totally different A brandnew brain structuredidnt just pop into existence Instead anatomy usedfor other tasks must have been sacrificed And as it turns outfor beautiful reasons detailed shortterm memory may have beena fair thing to lose in return for language This tradeoffbetween memory and language is the Cognitive TradeoffHypothesis  The Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis  is the culmination of decades of work  by one of the worlds leading primatologists  Professor Tetsuro Matsuzawa  of Kyoto Universitys Primate Research Institute  Founded in 1967  the institute was created for scientific research  in association with the nearby Japan Monkey Center The collaborative centers house over 60 species  and nearly 1000 primates who live and play in open spaces Look at monkeys monkeys chitter Is there a babyon that one Michael Six monthsTetsuro Yes gibbers Thats where they live MichaelCan you do it grunts  Dr Matsuzawa has spent over 40 years  researching nonhuman primates  He splits his time between fieldwork  in the West African country of Guinea  and here in Japan  where he and his colleagues have developed  a chimpanzee habitat  designed to mimic life in the wild This habitat is home to Skylab a working laboratory  set high atop the chimpanzee climbing structure  In this open air lab  chimpanzees are free to come and go as they please And this is how you move  If they decide to stay  they participate in cognitively enriching tasks  designed to mimic foraging behavior  When the chimpanzees are interested in participating  they enter one of Skylabs  specially designed computer booths  where a camera uses facial recognition software  to recognize them and select a test  based that particular chimps current familiarity  with the task  Each trial takes about as long  as it would for a chimp to forage a single bite  And each morsel of food they get  is accounted for in their diet Do the doors openwhen they approach No human even needs to be  So what is for us a great way to collect data  is for them an experience  similar in many ways  to what they would be doing in the wild Impressive  Dr Matsuzawa has been running memory tests like these  on chimpanzees since 1978  His research has shown the phenomenal  and nearly photographic shortterm memory  of these primates  Two of the most famous chimps at the PRI are Ai  named after the Japanese word for love  and her son Ayumu whose name means walk  What can we learn about ourselves  by studying chimpanzees like them  Well I want to find out If we and chimpanzeescome from a common ancestor what can explain the splitwhere the chimpanzees dont seem to needor to develop language like we did Why would that happenWas it an accident Ahha Our habitat provided a pressureto develop language Yes Thats incredibleMm So in a way we should bereally grateful that our ancestorswere so weak they got pushedout of the trees thumping Bang banglaughs Michael Id invite you to bea part of this interview but you dont have language Right now Mmhmm Quick decisions Our ancestors didnt havethat same pressure Hmm Michael The Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis  suggests that in the dangerous world beyond the trees  early humans needed to teach each other  and use abstract symbols that could refer  not just to the immediate here and now  but to hypotheticals and generalities  Making room for that kind of abstract thinking meant sacrificing the immediate and detailed memory  of their ancestors Yeah Im able to imaginepast and future Im able to describe thingsin an abstract way And I dont need the details because I have the label So it seems like a pretty goodtradeoff Yeah Yeah What a great message right Sharing is what makes us us I would love to see yourworking memory tests on chimpanzees in action I would also really loveto participate myself and see how well I can docompared to a chimpanzee Yes Have you ever hada human and a chimpanzee compete like thattogether hootingMichael Theyre excited about the idea toolaughs gibbering MichaelAn opportunity to do the memory task just like a chimpanzee  is really special  Who knows how it will go  Lets see who shows up clappingMichael Yeah Youre really goodat this Ai  Looks like todayit will be celebrity chimp Ai  Ai is older now and just like in humans  her cognitive abilities have decreased with time  So I may actually stand a chance  To face off against Ai  I will be sitting in the booth next to her  Normally her son Ayumu plays against her  But today wellshes in for some Michael time Im not your child thougham I  The tests are going to get harder as we go along  How will my memory compare to that of a chimp  who never made the same cognitive tradeoff exhales  In the first round the task is to remember where each of the three numbers are in numerical order  But heres the trick  as soon as I touch one of them on the screen  the other two will be covered by solid squares  so I can no longer see where they are  Now well its up to my memory TetsuroOkay lets go Michael If I make a mistake  I get an error noise like this buzzer  while a correct answer  sounds like this computer chirps  When the chimpanzee gets it right  they are rewarded with apples  The human me well just gets the bragging rights Im not getting apples laughs computer chirps You really actually haveto focus more than I expected Almost messed that one up buzzer computer chirps Tetsuro How did Michael do 95 Michael On my first run  Ive managed to beat Ai What is the next task How many symbols Whoa computer chirps This is a lot harder  This game is similar to the last  but starts a little bit differently  This time three numbers appear on a blank screen  but as soon as I touch the first one  the entire screen is covered in boxes computer chirps Whew buzzer computer chirps buzzer MichaelAi you having fun Whoagrunts  Ai is used to Ayumu her son playing the game beside her  so my presence may be throwing her off Im here for moral support Ai  It was fun squaring off against Ai  but I want to see how I would do against her son Ayumu Im ready Okay Michael Ayumu is currently Matsuzawas best pupil  able to ace the memory tests at blazingly fast speeds computer chirps  But today Ayumu is not interested in mental combat  Hes busy flirting with some young ladies  who live with him here at the PRI  And since free choice is the guiding principle  of Matsuzawas research we cant make him join us  The good news is that Ayumu doesnt need to be here  for me to compete against him  The game can be presented to me just as Ayumu does it  with nine numerals  Lets see if my luck is the same against Ayumu  as it was against Ai Oh man Okay buzzerWow laughs Even when I take timeI cant do it right Okay more time buzzer I thought I had that one It takes a long time to memorizenine numerals positions buzzer Its embarrassinghow long this takes me I can do this one computer chirps All right Yeah You dont needto laugh about it Thirteen I got better yeahbecause you were pressuring me Jesus Six times worsesix times slower Yeah I would love to Michael This is the most difficult test  I have to remember all nine numbers in numerical order  at Ayumus speed  which is to say I have to do  what I could barely do before  but now I have to memorize them all  within the amount of time  it takes to blink So I get half a secondto prepare Im going to prove you wrong  As a reminder this is how Ayumu performs  which is standard for a young chimp You got to be kidding me Thats way too fastbuzzer I got the first three buzzer Its like a joke buzzer laughsI dont know where the 2 is buzzer Its too fast Trying to think of thisvery holistically buzzer clears throat buzzer After the first three if I see themIm just having to guess laughs buzzer Yeah Its impossible Well I hope this washelpful for you It was the first time you hadhad a chimpanzee and a human together in the booth What do you think both laugh If you ever need meto study as a primate I give myself to youOkay Wow And we need to make sureto preserve them Theyre already endangeredYes And yet they are our closestlink to understanding what we came fromand where we might go TetsuroMm Michael Its like taking careof your family Tetsuro Mm rightMichael Quite literally TetsuroYes snarling Michael The fact that humans alone  use complex symbolic language  doesnt make us any better than any other species  It just means that the path we took required it  In fact in some ways we arent better  because we can talk  Today we study those who took different paths  as a way to learn more about ourselves  If we lose them we lose part of our story  where we came from  who we are  and who we can be in the future gibbering shrieks  And as always  thanks for watching  This season on Mind Field I will die But should I I want to performa reverse exorcism There was likea glowing figure man man I would love to do the Stanfordprison experiment again There lets blast them againNumber three electricity hums Have you ever had a human and a chimpanzee competelike that together You having fun

The Electric Brain,2018-01-03T17:00:01Z,27.733333333333334,2853577,0,The nervous systemis fundamentally electric When we move our arm it moves because a signal has been sent to the muscle that controls it and that messageis made of charged atoms moving in and outof nerve cells Its electricity Now because the brainis electric we could also useelectricity to record what the brain is doing or bypass it entirely and control a bodybeep That means thatwe could use our minds to move other peoples bodies restore movement to peoplewho are paralyzed feel through an artificial handas if it was our own and even read peoples minds Shocking theme music playing Even though electricity wasnt really understood until the 1800s its abilityto influence the body had been known since at least ancient Roman times when respected physician Scribonius Largus  wrote about a man  who accidentally stepped  on an electric fish  and was suddenly relieved of gout pain Scribonius did some experiments and found that you could putan electric fish  on your head and relieve headaches In 1804 centuries later  Italian physicist Giovanni Aldini  discovered he could make peoples muscles move  with electricity He amazed the European world by using electricity to animate the corpse of an executed criminal  The corpse opened its eyes  and even seemed to sit up But Aldini wasnt justtrying to shock people He was showing the worldthat neurons the cells that control both our thoughts and our movements operate through electricity buzzing Imagine bypassinga persons brain so as to control their body Now normallywhen you move your body your brain sendselectrical signals through nerves But if we could use electrodes to send those signals we could controla persons body without needing their brainto be involved We could control themwith a remote control and thats whatwe are about to do today with cockroaches Im here with Tim Marzullofrom Backyard Brains and Tim you broughtsome cockroaches Tim Yes Michaelcockroaches use their antenna to sense their environmentand move around and were going to tryto trick the cockroach and controlits movement for a numberof minutes Trick it how do we trick it We are going to do a surgeryon the cockroach where were going to hijackthe nervous system to send electrical impulsesto their antenna Michael All rightwell lets get to it Tim Lets do itMichael Ive brought with me today a stateoftheartcockroach operating room Now how do you do surgeryon a cockroach We have a jar of ice waterand to induce anesthesia we are going to putthe cockroaches in the ice waterand their nervous system will stop firingelectrical impulses Well notice after a minuteor two theyll stop moving  Michael Once the roaches were anesthetized  they were ready for surgery Tim All rightso then now what were gonna do is attach the electrodes So here we havethe little connector It has three wiresIt has a ground wire and it has a wirefor the left antenna and the right antenna Im going to puta little bead of Superglue on the cockroach right here and then Im just gonnastick the electrode on the cockroachs head  Michael Next we inserted the ground wire  into the flight muscle of the wing Tim There you goMichael Cool Tim I put the wirein the back Michael The remaining two wires  get inserted into the antenna Tim Now Im justgonna snip the antenna right there and we Michael And now becauseits a hollow tube we can stickthe wire in Tim So nowwhat Im gonna do is Im just gonna insert itinto the antenna All rightMichael Got it wow Tim And hes readyfor the left antenna There we goIt went right in there Ill put the cockroach right back in the ice water Now its worth pointing outwhat this does to them and to their quality of life Tim Yeah after the surgery Im gonna take them backto their homes snip the wiresand these cockroaches will then be retired Michael And the antennawill grow back Tim Yes and I will returnthem to our reproducing colony and theyll live happycockroach lives after the show Michael FantasticTim All right So now were ready to goMichael Wonderful  Our cyberroach was now neurologically wired  for external control Michael This isa stateoftheart roach racetrack Tim and I are aboutto take some roboroaches for a test drive But first Tim I wanna see howan ordinary roach moves aroundand uses its antenna Tim So lets just seewhere this guy goes He wants to explore my hand All rightand then oh wow WowRacin away And you can you seehes hugging that wall You can see he keeps tappingthe wall and moving along Hes not in the middleof the road hes on the edge of itMichael Yeah  As we know roaches use their antennas  to explore their surroundings  and locate food and shelter  When no walls or obstacles were sensed  the roaches felt free  to move around at will Hey guysTim Hey whoa whoa Michael follow the rules  It was time to testdrive  our roboroach Michael So thisis the battery along withthe Bluetooth device Tim And Im just gonna plugthem in right now Michael Were talkingabout actual voltages Tim Yes becausewe are talking to the nerves in a language thatthe nerves understand  Michael Tim has built an app  that communicates to the electrode  on the roachs back  When we swipe right  the electrode sends a signal  to the roachs left antenna  stimulating the sensation of an obstacle  on its left which causes the roach  to move right and vice versa Which way should we goleft or right I think we should go left Left Whoa Tim Okay well thatsMichael Doing donuts All right that wasa little bit too high Michael We adjusted the intensity of the signal  to find the optimal setting All right now Im gonna tryto get him to turn right go back through the factory Tim OhMichael Good job Tim Okay very goodMichael Good job Now he doesnt knowif theres a road so Im gonna have to tell himto kind of keep going to the right goodTim Okay very good Michael Yeah good come hereAll right where is he Did he just he wants to goto the hot air balloon He wants to goto the hot air balloon but I would ratherhe go to work at the factoryso Im gonna Im gonna Hes likeIll go back to work Michael Im gonna swipe left Tim OkayThere good All right left Tim Very goodMichael Now right Tim Ooh All rightMichael Good Michael All right watch this And turn rightTim Okay Michael Good good goodTurn right Tim All rightturns a little bit Michael Turn right ohTim Oh you see he adapts over timeMichael He adapts over time So we are taking away their autonomous controlof their body Were just causingthem to think they should decide to moveone way or the other Tim Yeah some peopleused to be sort of scared that were onthe slippery slope where Im gonna controla whole humanity with my electrical stimulationbut you can see that theres so many other sensorysignals that the cockroach is receivingthat were competing with So Tim this was very coolTim Uhhuh a little bit weirdTim Uhhuh I didnt feeltotally comfortable controllinga living organism UhhuhBut theres something here thats thats reallyimportant for the future of understanding brains Tim Surewe use this technology in biomedical applicationssuch as cochlear implants and deep brain stimulationto treat Parkinsons But things such asconsciousness and attention and will are currentlyreally at the cutting edge of neuroscience research How do youmake decisions The wonderful thingabout uh neuroscience isthat its wide open Michael In the very near future  cyber cockroaches could actually save lives  Researchers at Texas AM  and North Carolina State University  are developing a groundbreaking use  for roboroaches in search and rescue missions  Instead of installing wires  in the roachs antennae  theyre implanting receptors  in the bugs actual nervous systems  to insure a longerterm effect  The plan is to release a swarm of roboroaches  into a disaster area  like a collapsed building  As the roaches explore  theyll send images and data back to a computer  which creates a detailed 3D map  of the disaster zone  If the cyberbugs stray from the search area  their nerves get stimulated  to steer them back in  If a roach detects a survivor  a signal is sent back  with the victims location  While a real world test has not been done yet  scientists hope to do so  within the next 10 years  Meanwhile the same technology  used to cyberhack cockroaches  can also be used on humans Now Timwhen I move my arm my brain is sendingelectrical signals to my musclesand they respond to that and they contractand they release But you are aboutto use a battery to electricallystimulate my muscles Sure sure Michael A humans nervous system can be hacked  with no surgery required  Tim attached electrodes to my forearm  which communicated via Bluetooth  to an app on his iPad Tim So Im gonna amplifythe signals of your muscle activity So every time a neurontalks to the muscle the muscle firesan electrical impulse like the neurons So we can seethese electrical impulsesright here So what I want you to do is contractMichael grunts Oh yeah Tim All rightso there you goyou can see the impulses occurring in yourWatch this Tim So that whooshis the sound of many musclefibers firing Michael Many manyfiring action potentials because neurons are synapsingon those muscles when you are decidingto move your body Let me passively moveyour hand We dont see that much activitymaybe some stretch activity but now resist me Now theres no movementMichael Wow but were seeingelectrical activity because its dueto contraction So whats coolabout this is that becauseyou are making voluntary movementswith your brain we can exploit thesemuscle contractions and use itto control robotics Michael Okay so Timthis is all really cool but the real reasonI invited you here today and told you to bringall of this is that I want to controlanother human Alie Hi MichaelThanks for coming So Alie you might bea little apprehensive now after hearingwhat I just said but Yeah yeah I heard you This is for scienceand its gonna go both ways Im gonna let you controlmy arm as well You ready Okay Wait Im goingfirst though Youre gonna go firstI think thats important yes ForFor randomization Alie OkayI flipped a coin earlier that no one sawbut it happened  Alie Ward from the Ologies podcast  was brave enough to let me test  how the brain sends signals to the body  in this case my brain sending signals  to move her body  And weve placed a screen between us  so she cant see when I make a move  that sends the signal All right lets do itSo Michael Okay Should I contractlike softly or firmly Just go all the way like that yesAll the way Okay here we goAll right Did you feel anythingNot yet no Im not strong enoughOkay Im gonna turn it up a little bit okayAlie Okay yeah It feels like pins and needlesa little bit Tim Okay Youre at twoIm gonna turn up to four okay Alie All rightOkay Now contractMichael Ah That was really reallyreally weird Tim ContractOh thats really weird Tim OkayThis is really weird Oh thats IdIm still not over that It feels like uhIm a marionette and theres just stringsbeing tugged Michael For the sake of science it was only fair  that I give Alie a turn at the controls  But I also wanted to know  what it was like to have someone  control my movements All right now whileAlie controls my body I thought it would be niceto maybe enjoy some hot brightred tomato soup and a nice glassof grape juice I might even do some writingscoffs multitasking So um can we try outthe strength uh just like geta bit of a sense of whats gonna happen to meAll right So Ill put itreally low at a two Michael Good yeahTim Okay And uh okaynow contract Alie All right Ah okay yup I felt itContract again I feltOkay Did you feel that YesTim All right now Im gonna turn it upto a four Okay All rightnow contract You readyYup laughter Wow Thats um thats not me moving my arm Or the rest of yourentire body responds Michael Well yeahIm a jumpy person so youre gonna geta lot more out of me OkayMichael Now please dont control me while I just take a nicerelaxing sip of Alie chuckles Tim Ill turn it upto five and a half Michael Okay Im justgonna take a nice little uh taste of this soup This is so meanI love it chuckles The meanest part is thatthis is very lukewarm soup All right Now just let meplease eat in peace Im sorryMichael All right Im gonna take a breakand write something Ill leave you aloneIll leave you alone Okay groans Im tryI can resist it but  Like the cockroaches my body was learning  to adapt to the signal To science Thats the beautyof electrophysiology Of course the fact that ourneurons work through electricity means that we can alsorecord from them and that has amazingmedical applications The electroencephalogramor EEG came about in the 1920s  allowing doctors to see some of the brains  electrical signals as visible brain waves  But by the 1980s scientists realizedthat for some tasks like the dream of allowingparalyzed patients to move a robotic arm you need a much richerbrain signal  Thats because moving an arm  requires a lot of information  You need information for how to move your upper arm  your forearm your hand  your fingers all through 3D space EEG just doesnt carry enoughinformation to do that since the electrical signalsit picks up get distortedafter they make their way through our skull and skin So if you wanted to controla prosthetic limb with just your mindresearchers realized youd need to recorddirectly from the brain And in 2006 scientists finallydid just that  They implanted an electrode  in the brain of a paralyzed human  for the very first time  And since that first test patient  several paralyzed patients  have received brain implants  that allow them to control robotic arms  with their minds  As our understanding of the brain grows  and our computers get better  at decoding signals from the brain  these patients are gaining finer and finer control  over these robotic arms  Recently science has taken a big leap forward  from allowing paralyzed patients  to control robotic limbs  to giving them control of their own limbs  I traveled to Ohio State University  to meet one of those patients Ian Burkhart  At 19 while vacationing with friends  Ian dove into a wave at the beach  and broke his neck on the sandy floor  leaving him paralyzed from the chest down Ian I knew as soon as I hit that I was paralyzed And I was floatingfacedown in the water and could not get upCould you Ian I couldnt moveanything at all  You go from being 19 and independent  living on your own in college to now  I need help doing everything  from eating to going to the bathroom  sitting up getting into my wheelchair  I can move my shoulders pretty well can move my bicepsthat allow me to move my armsa little bit but nothingfrom my biceps down Michael The doctors at Ohio State had approached  Ian about a revolutionary experimental treatment  developed by Battelle  a research and development firm  using cuttingedge technology  called NeuroLife  They wanted to implant a chip  in Ians motor cortex  which would allow him to move his hand again  while he was connected to a computer in the lab  I was invited to the Wexner Medical Center  at Ohio State University to meet the researchers  and witness this cuttingedge work in action Sam So first were gonna plugIan into the system Ian The piece uh isprotruding from my skull as Michael YeahIan reference thats the pedestal Its undera little protective cap um but its there 247and it leads to some wires that go to the actualmicrochip array thats on the surfaceof my brain Michael Pushed intothe actual organ of the brain Ian Exactly Michael The microchip in Ians head  detects the blood flow  and electrical impulses of his brain  that are associated with causing movement SamSo this is the actual chip It sits on the surfaceof his brain Michael Wow  Ians brain is connected to software  that reads and analyzes  his brain activity So this is a live look at Ians motor cortex Marcie Yes So if you think aboutmoving your arm we should see more activity or a different patternIan Yeah Michael At the start of the session  in order to calibrate the decoder with his brain  Ian is prompted to think about  moving his hand by watching images  of hand movements Ian Youll seemy computer prompt me and as it prompts meto do that thats whatIm thinking about What do you meanthink about Ian Just as muchas I can think about imagining that movementYeah  As Ians brain thinks about moving his hand Sam Okay Ian are you readyYup Michael its electrical signals  are detected by the chip  and sent to the decoder Then we takethat information and we associate itwith a hand closed So now the decodercan recognize if hes thinkingthat same thing again Michael Next the decoder sends a signal  to a device that can control  Ians muscle movement  This special sleeve on Ians arm  contains a hundred and thirty electrodes  which stimulate the muscles in his forearm  to produce the specific movements  that his brain is thinking about  such as closing his hand  or moving his thumb  Now it was time to see Ian move his paralyzed hand  with his thoughts Sam So Ian if youre readyfor this next one Ian YupIm gonna count you down Three two one Michael Whoa Marcie Sothat was the decoder Decoding his thoughts Decoding his thoughtsMichael Wow Marcie Ian was in controlof the movements Michael Nice work  Already Ians achievements  go far beyond closing his hand  With the help of this cuttingedge technology  he can use his own paralyzed hand  to do a number of fine motor tasks  from everyday movements  to playing Guitar Hero How many other peopleare like Ian Currently in the world maybe five Michael Ian continues to gain more independence  outside the lab as well Do peopleever drive with you and get nervous likeOh my gosh well clearlythis is dangerous Ian I thinkif everyone else that was drivingalong in the road knew I have no use of my hands going 70 miles an hourdown the freeway they may not like that But theyve they havenothing to worry about Ian Right yeahand Im probably safer because I cant takemy hands off the wheel to get on my cell phone andRight Yup Youre not fiddlingwith the radio and Yeah that I shouldnt bedoing while Im driving  Michael Ians progress was truly inspiring  and this was only the beginning for him What are your hopesfor the future for yourself Ian HopefullyI can upgrade to the next versionand you know have more capabilities and be able to do thingsa lot easier  In the long term I hope that this can be a device  that people just use  You have someone who has a spinal cord injury  and they can just continue  right where they left off I think you knowthe work that were doing is something that hasnever been done before and its really exciting to beon that cutting edge Restoring movementis one thing but what about feeling sensation We feel with our skinbecause of signals sent to the somatosensorycortex of our brain By putting sensorsin robotic fingers connected to implantsin a persons somatosensory cortex researchersat the University of Pittsburgh have enabled Nathan Copeland to feelthrough a robotic hand  Nathan underwent brain surgery  to receive two implants  one in his motor cortex  to control a robotic arm  and a second implant  over his somatosensory cortex  This second implant  stimulates his brain  and the pattern of stimulation depends  on what part of the robot hand is touched  So if you touch the robot on a specific finger  then the part of Nathans somatosensory cortex  that normally responds to that finger  get stimulated Nathan Pinky Uh middle Michael His brain interprets that as touch  Nathan and Ians remarkable achievements  have been aided by their ability  to communicate with the researchers involved  But what can be done for people  who are not only unable to move  but also unable to speak  Steve Kaplan was an active  57yearold computer programmer dating Laurie  a horse wrangler for the rodeo  But that all changed a year ago  when he suffered a massive stroke  leaving him in a vegetative state  unable to move or speak  Doctors initially declared Steve brain dead  However inside his body  he was fully conscious  but unable to tell them so  It wasnt until a nurse noticed  that Steves eye movements were intentional  that he was diagnosed with lockedin syndrome  a condition which robs people of everything  but their mind  While a normal brain receives electrical signals  from the senses and sends signals back to them  the stroke prevented the electrical signals  from leaving Steves brain  Over the last year  with the help of physical therapists  Steve has regained some very minor  range of motion in his neck  I sat down with Steve and his nowwife Laurie  to learn more about lockedin syndrome Steve Laurie hello  Although hes still unable to speak  thanks to new scientific developments  Steve can communicate with the outside world  using a computer computer male voice Hello Michael MichaelNice to meet you Steve And niceto meet you Laurie First of allthank you so much for giving us some time Tell me how Steve startedbeing able to communicate Laurie Well you knowI asked a lot of questions about lockedin syndrome when they explainedwhat it was and there wasnta lot of answers YeahLaurie At the beginning he would blink once for yesand twice for no  And that was the first parts of the communication  And then they gave us a board  and I went through the ABCs  and he would close his eyes  when I got to what he wanted  Id write it down  and thats how it began Michael As you could imagine  Laurie and Steves first method of communicating  was a slow and painstaking process  But just months later  an engineer working to help  lockedin patients  built Steve a machine  that tracks his eye movements  As Steve looks at different letters on a screen  the machine translates where hes looking  into synthesized audible speech computer male voice I want to recover Michael Although theres still a slight delay  in communication as Steve scans  the letters on the screen  this method is much more fluid  and significantly faster The computer helps mecommunicate Michael YeahYou can write with your eyes LaurieThis things amazing He can emailhe can text call meif he needs something Its such a relief computer male voice It does wonders MichaelIt does wonders yes Uhhmm chucklesMichael And I could only imagine how emotionalit would have been to you to be able to lookand write a thing and then have it spoken And Lauriefor you to hear words coming from his mindfrom his heart especiallyfor the first time in a long timeLaurie Yes What was the first thingyou said Steve computer male voice The first message was happy birthday laughter What a birthday present Laurie laughsIt really was Michael Steves progress is remarkable  and it would be difficult to deny  the connection between his new ability to communicate  and connect with the outside world  with the incredible advances  hes made physically over the last year Look up at the ceilingMichael Yeah Look down at your thumbsclears throat Look over at meyour beautiful wife laughter Michael Laurie and Steve hope that one day  Steve will make a full recovery  from lockedin syndrome Steves eyetracking deviceis electric and so is his brain Theyre connected by the fact that Steve can move his eyes But some lockedin patients cant even controltheir eye movements They have what is known as completelylockedin syndrome For these patientsthe eyetracking technology that helped Steve communicateis useless  But researchers in Europe recently found a way  of allowing completely lockedin patients  to communicate using just their thoughts  The researchers combined EEG  with nearinfrared spectroscopy  which can noninvasively  measure blood flow in the brain The patients were asked simple yes or no questions that the researchersknew the answers to which allowed themto train a machine to recognize which brain signals meant yes and which brain signalsmeant no The researchersthen asked the patients a new set of questions they knew the answer to and using just their thoughts  the patients were able to give  the correct answers to 70 of the questions Now giving justyes or no answers may be limited but this technology is new All of this happenedjust this year  These rapid advancements  thanks to the devotion and effort of researchers  and subjects around the world  are slowly but surely  chipping away at the mysteries of the mind The betterwe understand the mind the betterwell be able to help the millions of peoplewho struggle to do what they wantbecause of psychological or neurological conditions and ultimately the betterwell understand ourselves And as

Divergent Minds,2017-12-27T17:00:05Z,26.216666666666665,4327684,0,ambient music playing Michael Derek have you ever watched Mind Field on YouTube No but I would liketo watch it Michael Michael Okay So Mind Fieldhas a theme song that Id lovefor you to listen to to see if you can play itfor me on the piano I would like to listen to itMichael All rightJust load this up here theme music playing playing piano Oh hello This is a tray of brains Cow brains Here is a sagittal sliceI prepared earlier Now imagine thatthis is my brain Just looking at itit would be impossible to know what part does what or that different partsdid different things at all But if you changespecific parts of your brain you can often affectspecific functions So if this was my brain that would be pretty bad I would almost certainly have just becomecortically bind Of course scientists cant gocutting and poking and stabbing peoples brains to see how it affectstheir behavior but they can study the behaviorand abilities of people whose brains are differentfrom neurotypical brains  For instance in rare cases  people whose eyes function normally but who are blind due to damage to their visual cortex  may experience the neurological phenomenon  of blindsight  which allows them to sense and respond  to objects they cannot see  Due to a brain injury this patient  is consciously blind on his right side  But while he sees nothing in his right field of vision  hes able to sense the presence and motion  of an object he cannot see man Youre moving it up and down  I am aware of a motion  but that motion has no shape  no color no depth no form no contrast Michael Blindsight is possible  because besides the visual cortex  which is associated with conscious vision  there are other brain areas  that get information from the eyes unconsciously  We have learned about this unconscious vision we all have  because of blindsight  The study of divergent minds has revolutionizedour understanding of the brain in ways that would not have beenpossible otherwise People who differ from the norm expose elementsof all our minds that we didnt even knowwere there ambient music playing upbeat music playing Michael One very special divergent mind  is that of Derek Paravicini Lets goWere gonna count a hundred to find the hotel okayOkay Yeah both One two three Michael Derek is both blind and autistic  Hes also a musical savant Now for the live musicyou were promised Michael meaning despite severe cognitive  and social impairments  his musical ability is far greater  than what would be considered normal  And tonight hes performing at the release party  for his latest album playing Flightof the Bumblebees  Derek possesses an incredible gift  Hes performed all over the world  and has become a symbol of success for other autistic individuals Later well take a deeper look into Dereks unique mind Thank you upbeat music playing Michael One hundred and fifty years ago scientists still didnt know if different parts of the braindid different things It was only by studying peoplewith atypical minds  that we discovered that there are different modules in the brain that havedifferent functions The first major discovery showing that the brain hadthese specialized modules was made by a doctornamed Paul Broca in the 1800s Broca had heard of a patientwho had no problem understanding language but who struggledto produce language The only thing the patientcould say was the sound tan over and over He would say tan tan tan tan tan tan tantan tan tan tan tan When the patient died Broca performedan autopsy on him and found thatthe patients brain had damage to a specific part  of its left hemisphere  Broca concluded that this brain region  now called Brocas Area must be importantfor producing speech but notfor understanding speech This language deficitcalled Brocas Aphasia still affects hundredsof thousands of people who get strokesin the left side of their brain A patient with Brocas Aphasiacan talk but strugglesto get the words out woman So whats your name Scott Oh no Sarah Scottwoman Thats right And how old are you I cant woman TryI cant Michael Another partof the brain related to speech  is Wernickes Area  which is associated with language comprehension  Patients who damage this region  can speak fluenty  but they are unabe to understand languae  or use it in a meaningful wa woman What were we just doingwith the iPad Right at the momenta darn should a darn thing woman With the iPadthat we were doing Like here Id like my change for meand change hands for me It was happy I would talk with Donnasometimes Were all with them Other people are workingwith them them Im very happy with them These remarkable individualshave taught us a lot about the neural basisof language But it can be trickyto infer the functions of different brain areas based onlyon specific patients Thats because damage is almostnever confined to one spot and the braincan reorganize itself after its been damaged So to get a more precise pictureof how changing the brain affects behavior and function I went to UCLA to have my brain damaged But not permanently Im not gonna havea piece of my brain removed and thrown away Instead Im going to havepart of my brain tissue temporarilyand safely disrupted by a technology called transcranialmagnetic stimulation Here I go Usually I start by saying Im glad to be here Im medium to be here Im a little anxious aboutwhats about to happen Today youre goingto be giving me a brain lesiontemporarily So I should cease to be ableto produce words Right That actually just soundsvery frightening I like to be in controlespecially of myself Should I be worried Michael Transcranial magnetic stimulation  or TMS for short applies a strong magnetic pulse  to one part of the brain  such as Brocas Area  This briefly disrupts electric function  in the part of the brain that is stimulated  Its like causing temporary brain damage  But as soon as the pulse is over  functioning goes back to normal  While its not guaranteed that TMS  will affect my ability to speak  Dr Iacoboni has successfully stimulated  Brocas Aphasia on other test subjects Transcranialmagnetic stimulation to see what happens when such clickingindistinct speech traditionof studying individuals Michael Now it was time to have my speech disrupted  But to stimulate my Brocas Area  first we had to find it using an MRI scan of my brain Hopefully well be able to findBrocas Area and shut me up John So its gonna feela little bit like somebody tappingon your scalp and you might feel some superficialmuscle stimulation UhhmmJohn So this will probably bea little bit uncomfortable It might bea lot uncomfortable If it becomes too much just say the word stopand we will stop Okay Im just gonna pull out the first chapterof Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen and Ill juststart reading and you guys will startstimulating my Brocas Area My dear Mr Bennetsaid his lady to him one day Have you heard thatNetherfield Park is let at lastclicking Mr Bennet repliedthat he had not But it isreturned she for Mrs Longhas just been here and she told meall about it Mr Bennet made no answer Do you not want to knowwho has taken it cried his wife impatiently You want to tell me and I haveno objection to hearing it This was invitation enough  We tried a couple of times  but my Brocas Area seemed to be playing hard to get  So we repositioned the machine New trajectory Enter Okay great You and the girls may go or you may send themby themselves which perhapswill be better still for as you are as handsomeas any of them Mr Bingley may like youthe best of the party When a womanhas five grownup After several more attempts  we were still unsuccessful at finding my Brocas Area  and disrupting my speech married its solacewas visiting and news I beat it Yeah no You cannot stop her from being heard  While neuromapping allows us to locate  the many different areas of the brain  the brain is one of the most complex organs in our body  and not all brains respond to TMS in the same way  TMS didnt work on me this time  but different test subjects produce different results Is find out whatindistinct Okay thats probably goodfor now Michael TMS is currently being evaluated  to treat depression  and certain types of brain damage  One day it may even be used  to reduce the effects of traumatic brain injury upbeat music playing Michael I traveled to London to meet someone  who was using his divergent mind  in an extraordinary way Derek its Michael Oh hello MichaelNice to meet you Im Derek How are you Would you liketo come in Michael Im fantasticI would love to come in Yes Its an honor I wanted to find out what Derekcould teach us about all brains So Derek Im doing a showcalled Mind Field about psychology Do you know psychology I do know psychology Your brainis different than mine Would you agree I would agree Michael Its differentthan my brain yesYes  It became evident very quickly  that this was going to be an atypical interview Im sure you hearall the time about how spectacularyour abilities are Were you told thateven at a young age when you first startedto interact with a piano I was told at a young age when I first startedto interact with a piano Michael Derek has echolalia a condition which causes him to repeat back words  spoken to him  Its his way of trying to understand  the spoken word You can learn musicjust by listening to it I can learn musicby listening to it Michael Michael But while Derek may find  spoken language challenging he has no problem communicating through music playing jazz  There are about seven million autistic savants worldwide  with some level of savant skills  but Derek is whats known as a prodigious savant  which means that his musical skills are so outstanding  that they would be considered spectacular  even for highly trained neurotypical musicians  There are probably fewer than a hundred prodigious savants  in the whole world Alan Derek Paravicini has a musicality  that I think any performer would envy What sort of musicdo you really love Derek Uh maybepop music or OkayJazz Derek A bit of jazz yeah Michael Since he was five years old  Derek has been mentored by Adam Ockelford Through the doorWell done Derek  Michael Adam is a music psychologist  author and professor  at the University of Roehampton Thats your right handnow do your left hand Go on Derek was born very premature  Twentysix weeks which thirtyeightyears ago was veryvery premature And they didnthave any equipment in the hospital for him So they rushed himinto the nearest hospital that had an incubatorand Derek wasnt thought ableto survive and yet he did Hes such a fighter Because of the circumstancesof his birth and the impact of blindnessand learning difficulties his brain developedin a particular kind of way As a little boy he wasvery fascinated by sound not being able to see And his nanny gave himthis little electric organ and that was likea eureka moment for him and the beginningsof his music processing ability So things like languagethings like perhaps understandinghow people feel these things are verydifficult for Derek And yet his musicis way above average Dereks gotan amazingly quick ear havent you Derek I have yesIf I go like or or He can processan amazing Michael Its like automaticYeah MichaelThats impressive Derek Thank you Michael Yeah no the responseto pitch that you make Derek is incredibly fast Weve measured the timebetween playing even a big chordsay like this one And Derek can listen and react to an eightnote chordwithin about 04 of a second WowDereks sense of pitchis very unusual Its also known as perfectIt is It is perfect  Something like 40 of babies  born premature who lose their sight  have perfect pitch as opposed to  about one in ten thousandin the neurotypical population  So you can see that  the impact of not being able to see has a massive effect onthe way the brain develops And how does autismplay into this Well autismis an added factor Autism starts at very earlyin life we know that And in Dereks caseof course when he came outof the incubator And what autism tendsto do is to give children this immense focuson the sheer quality of things whether its a sound or a or a color or a scent Thats the qualitythat we all have as babies that we experience the worldin this sheer perception Now most babies very quicklycome out of that by 12 18 months Theyre startingto categorize things just to make sense of the amountof information thats coming in So youre bornand your body is like consuming allof this sense data raw YeahMichael And thenit learns thats crazy  We dont need to process every little detail  We only need to understand whats important  or relevant and thats enough Adam Its calledcategorical perception and that is a much moreefficient way of processing informationand of course thats whythe brain does it But autistic childrenthey hang on to those absolute qualitiesfor longer For people like Derekand since hes not only got those fantasticallyvivid absolute memories hes also learnedthe rules of music but its built on thison this foundation of perceptual vividness thatwe can only grasp at Michael While most people would find it impossible  to identify all of the individual notes  in a 10 or 20note chord  Derek is able to do this with ease  which means he can decipher more notes  than he can play at once with two hands So we could do thatIf I Actually I haveI have hands We could combineYes yes yeah So right so if you play thosetwo notes with that hand Michael YupAnd those two with that hand And well count for it okayOne two three four There you areMichael What wasall the fiddling Adam Well the fiddlingwas to make it because he couldnt reach themall at the same time Michael RightAdam So hishe was splitting them up Michael Hes just playingbut they were all they were all in thereHe just couldnt all playthem at once  But as amazing as his musical ear is  Dereks cognitive abilities are less than rudimentary Adam Derek should we dosome more chords Derek Well do somemore chords Adam So can you play this for meDerek Yes Adam Ready Good And do you know how manynotes there are Derek Derek Im not sureAdam Have a guess How many do you think Is it oneAdam Yeaha bit more than one So theres oneOne two three four five six AdamSix werent there RightDerek Theres six Adam Adam GoodNow try this one then Derek Ready and Derek Is it one note Adam Adam No there are fiveOne two three four five DerekOne two three four five It is one two threefour five Adam Michael Tell me more about how limited Dereks everyday abilities are Derek findsalmost everything that you or I do withoutthinking really difficult So selfcarethings like getting dressed getting washed in the morningare tricky for him So all those thingsthat we take for granted he finds really difficult Cynthia DerekDerek Yes Cynthia Well haveto clean your mouth Derek Could you cleanmy mouth now Cynthia Cynthia YesCan you come to the sink Derek I can cometo the sink  Adam And in fact 38 years on were saying Well does it reallymatter if Derek cant put his sockson himself You knowthere are other things in life And and yet whenhe touches the piano everythings reversed So things that we would findinconceivably difficult Derek does it as easyas breathing And if you ask himDerek howd you do that he has no idea any more than youor I understand how we breatheor how we speak or YeahIts purely intuitive playing ragtime Michael In addition to entertaining people with his remarkable abilities  Derek offers valuable insight  to scientists who study the mind What do you think Derekis helping us learn about this thingin our head I think whatDereks example tells us is the almost infinitecapacity of the human brain to not only survive but thrive in incrediblydifficult circumstances And Dereks potential really was no differentfrom anyone elses Theres no one in his familywho were particularly musical So in a sense you could saythat we all have Dereks potentialwhen were born But fortunately of coursewe dont have his disadvantages and what gave Derekhis massive advantage is at the costof his disadvantages upbeat music playing Autism stillisnt well understood  One of the many theories for the cause of autistic peoples heightened sensory awareness is that its at least partially due to an abnormality in the brains left hemisphere  permitting a vast amount of sensory details  to enter the brains awareness Neurotypical brains may receive all the same sensory details but block them from awareness In fact some psychologistshave even proposed that all of ushave savant skills lying dormant in our brains And they may be on to something because in extraordinarilyrare cases people can actually acquiresavant skills A very small number of peoplehave what is called Acquired Savant Syndrome These are people who sufferedsome sort of brain damage as adults and their brain damage actually unlocked skillsand abilities that werent there before  Jason Padgett is one such acquired savant  After a brain injury left him with damage  to his visual cortex  Jason started seeing precise geometric patterns  in everything around him  which led to an intuitive perception of math  and physics that he never had before How did you geta brain injury So I was at a karaoke barand as we left these two guysthat were in there singing attacked me from behind They smashed mein the back of the head Well I just heardthis deep thud saw a littlepuff of white light which I later found outwas my brain bouncing on the insideof my skull I didnt know where I washow I got there why I was being attacked Michael So now youhave Akinetopsia meaning you seethe world now in frames What does that meanIn discreet picture frames When I say discreetlyI mean seeing one picture and another pictureSo imagine like anybody watching TV right nowthey can hit pause and pause again and seethe picture frame by frame by frame Its just like thatbut in real time It also makes everything lookslightly pixelated So boundaries of objectsdont look curved like smooth curves anymore They look likethey have these tiny little straight line edges Are you seeing methat way right now Yes So likeif youre not moving its more like a pictureon a picture on a picture so its not nearlyas profound but when something moveslike this then its much more profound So after the injury you have all theseperceptual changes What makes you decidethat you needto start drawing So at the timeI had no way to describe what I was seeingin any terms except for to draw it I started tryingto define things with trianglesand straight lines Geometry is to meis the one thing everything has even nothingEmpty space is geometry It just seemed obvious I mean the universeis math for me  Michael Are these thoughts that you wouldve had before the injury No not at allNever even contemplated this type of stuff and nowI cant stop thinking about it and I wound up goingto the mall So Im sitting thereeating this sandwich and Im drawingand this guy next to me he says hes a physicistAnd he goes It looks like youre doingsome sort of math there And I started telling himyou know my ideas And he says It sounds to melike youre trying to describe space time and limits And things thatI didnt understandwhat he was talking about He goes But youre doing itin layman terms and Ive never heard anybodytry to do that before It turns outit was integrals What I was doingwas integrals and calculus Youre now pursuingan education in math Jason YesSo would you say that youre still the same person who existedbefore the injury or did you becomea different individual I feel like Ivehad two different lives Before the injury I didnt haveany background in math I didnt even have algebra I didnt even knowthat you could graph a line All I did was partyand chase girls It was a very shallowyou know almost blissfullyignorant life Do you thinkthat these abilities were always in your brain and got somehowunlocked by the injury or did the injurygive you something new I 100 believe thatwe all have this in us You know people thinkthat I got hit in the head and just magicallygot good at math but a lot of itis your brain gets damaged and youre forced to seethe world differently and by seeing the worlddifferently it makes you thinkdifferently Michael We can learnso much from divergent minds  whether it would be someone like Jason  who developed his divergent mind  from an accident as an adult Hello Ashleigh Ashleigh Hello Derek Derek How are you Michael or someone like Derek  whose divergence came  from complications at birth Adam One of Dereksgreat strengths is working with other disabled peopleand disabled children They love him Beautiful AshleighWell done Derek is a hero particularly amongstthe learning disabled For anyone with severelearning difficulties to have a public life to travelall over the world to meet hundreds of people to have acclaimfrom millions of people on the internet is hes uniquein that perspective Hes a trailblazerbut we should never forget that hes part of a populationthats much bigger and tends to be hidden awayfrom society upbeat music playing Derek raisesimportant questions about the diversity of minds Autistic mindslike all divergent minds are not alientheyre human minds and they provide windowsinto how we all think feel and behave A complete brain scienceshould be able to account for all kindsof minds and brains As long as some mindsremain a mystery so too will all minds And as alwaysthanks for watching theme music playing Adam ImprovHere we go theme music playing

The Power of Suggestion,2017-12-20T17:00:02Z,28.816666666666666,89633563,0,dramatic music playing Michael This is McGill University  in Montreal Canada It boasts an enrollment of morethan 40000 students from 150 countries The campus employs1700 professors teaching 300 programsof study and its proud to be hometo 12 Nobel Prize winners It is consideredone of the finest research universitiesin the world Recently researchers at McGillhave embarked on a study that uses a brain scanningdevice to read peoples minds and implant thoughtsinto their heads Or so their subjects think Now the same device may be ableto help kids with ADHD anxietyobsessivecompulsive disorder migrainesTourettes and more This study is notabout technology The MRI machine behind memay look impressive but its a sham Its deactivatednonfunctioning What this studyis really about is faith in science Its about the powerof thoughts to heal All you need is the powerof suggestion theme music playing A placebo is somethingthat shouldnt work but due to the powerof suggestion and because of the strengthof our belief does But we dont fully understandyet how they work  There could be an evolutionary explanation  For example if a small child hurts themselves  negative symptoms like pain and crying can be good  They keep the child safe and still  while signaling adults to come help  When help arrives  even if it has no active effect  the childs brain may feel  it has permission to redirect  resources away from seeking help  and onto actually healing  Modern medicine has found a way to harness this power  by prescribing placebos But not all placebos workthe same For example a sugar pillwill help your headache more if given to you by a doctor than by a poker buddy And the colorof the placebo matters too A blue pill will workto make you feel calm better than a white pill because blueis a more calming color And a red pillwill keep you awake and give you more energy than a blue pill will A capsule will workbetter than a pill because it looksmore important Also an injection will workbetter than a capsule because it seemsmore serious and potent Theres even evidencethat fake or sham surgeries have positive effects It may be fake medicine but the effects can be real And not just because the patientfeels better psychologically Were talkingreal physical healing thanks to the powerof the brain  I traveled to Montreal  to meet local children struggling  with debilitating behavioral  and neurological conditions  who would soon find out whether their afflictions  could be cured by the power of suggestion This is MalayaHi Malaya Im MichaelNice to meet you  Twelveyearold Malaya suffers from a common  skin ailment eczema  But she has also developed  a skin picking disorder dermatillomania Youre starting high schoolwhat like this year Early September Wow thats a big step So what kind of thingslike worry you uh given the symptomsthat you have Probably the picking Of your skinMalaya Yeah I dont know I findit satisfying to pick Its kind of gross Why do you thinkyou cant stop Im not sure Have you trieddifferent things thatll help you stop Yeah Like in my mind Im just likeToday you wont pick You are gonna get ridof this eczema And then afterIm just like Oh wait My face islike bleeding Yeah Is it embarrassingYeah I like to wear long sleevesbecause my arms are like if theyre really badIm gonna try to wearlong sleeves How are your arms now Its like really badSo as you can see And its all justfrom scratching and picking Yeah  Twelveyearold Nicholas was troubled  by debilitating migraine headaches So what do you wannabe when you grow up Like I reallyreally wanna be uh probably like an NHLor an MLB player one of those two  Nicholass love of sports is unfortunately also  the original source of his suffering Nice My first head injurywhich was concussion I hit my headon a soccer post And then I hit my headin a game of uh hockey Uh after that I had headachesevery single day I was throwing uphaving auras theyre like uh colors that you see beforeyou have a headache I wasnt able to goto school and then we wentto the hospital and into theirconcussion program  Can I see his migraine chart Oh sure Yeah We havealmost two years worth Severe headaches heresevere migraines Michael Every dayDanielle Every single day This has turnedhis world upside down  Nathan was diagnosed with ADHD  and impulse control disorder Id love to hear especiallyabout you Nathan First of allhow old are you NineMichael Nine How old you areMichael How olddo you think I am ThirtyThats a very good guess Im 31Ooh So tell me about likebefore Nathans diagnosis What were kind of the symptomsyou were seeing Tantrums all the time um just an inabilityto reach him to communicate to himto connect to him that was the main symptom And what did youthink of this Nathan Were you like Why aremy parents not happy Why werent youNathan I dont know Maybe because I have problems And as far aslike behavior Impulsivityhyperactivity and youre alwaysalways on the edge always stressedwhat is he gonna touch where is he gonna gowhat is he gonna do  These families had tried conventional methods  to treat their children with little success  But they were about to find out  whether their symptoms could be alleviated  using an accessoryassisted placebo  a fake nonfunctioning MRI machine  This groundbreaking study of the power of suggestion  and action is the brainchild of pioneering researchers  at McGill Universitys esteemed Raz Lab We study a whole bunchof different mindbody interaction topicssuggestion hypnosis placebo effects Anytime the mind is regulatingthe body or vice versa thats a topicthat we study Now you saidthe word placebo And the devicethat we are using is a sham scanner  Tell me about the scanner Jay What we do with the MRI scanners is we stack so many differentlayers of deception In their head this isa proper neuroscience study done at the neurologicalinstitute And thats why we wearlab coats Thats why we haveall of this scientificlookingequipment By the time theyve actuallystarted the study theyve already in their mind built up all these differentlayers of credibility They really believe thatwhat were doing is real Dr Veissiere Whatsinteresting is that children theyre not immune to the powerof neuroenchantment NeuroenchantmentNeuroenchantment What does that meanSo its this idea that there is some kindof medical magic There is immense powerthat is attached to the cultureof neuroscience  whereby neuroscientific props and accessories  have more healing power  more physiological effects because culturallypeople believe that they do I mean the same kindof cultural cognitive mechanisms are at playin religious systems So here we are prayingto the gods of neuroscience and biomedicine Talk to me aboutthe ethics of lying The work we dowith children actually does notinvolve lying We tell them at firstthat everything that they see and everything that we doin the lab is a suggestion We explain to themthat suggestion is a way to tap into the powerof their mind We keep emphasizing evenas they go in the scanner that it is their mindand their brainthat is doing the healing that theyre basicallyreprogramming their own brain  The parents knewthat the scanner was a placebo  But for the study to work the children  had to believe in the procedure  So before they visited the lab  I enlisted a few YouTuber friends  to help raise their expectations Veronica Hey guys Today we havea huge surprise for you about somethingbrand new in science that could affect you Oh I know them  Well today we learned about  this amazing new machie  that teaches kids brais  how to heal superfas  We really hope that you get the chance in person  to see how this machine works With a little helpfrom the machine you can focus betterbe more confident And it can even take awaysome headachesAwesome Vanessa Not too many people get the chance  to have this awesome experience  but we hear the scientists in Canada Im going to have itYeah And its very cool So what do you hopethe machine allows you to dothat makes you better at Better at concentrating better at focusing I wanna heal faster and this will probablybe a good idea I hope it heals me upwith my concussions and then I hopemy headaches go away  I was about to take part in something remarkable  the very first use of accessoryassisted suggestion on children with these kinds of symptoms Mind Field would play an integral role in the study  And the results could be new and significant for science  On the day of the first session  several measures were put in place  to heighten the childrens neuroenchantment NathanNathan Nathan  A friendly fake nurse  a walk down a long impressive hallway sighs  and a tenminute anticipation  building wait outside the lab  Then it was time for their first scan Shall we  While the hypothesis of this study  was grounded in science  this was Dr Veissiere  and Jay Olsons first time  testing their theory on real children  with real disorders  and they didnt know if it would work You may lie downif youd like  One of my roles was to help build up  the childrens belief that it would work As you go into the machineyoull relax more and more Would you like to relaxslowly or quickly today Uh I can go in quicklyOh wow nice Very good  Although the MRI scanner  was completely deactivated  we needed the kids to believe  it was fully functional machine beeps  So Jay played a series of realistic sound effects  to signify that the machine was working  while Dr Veissiere planted the suggestion  that it would help the patient heal You might noticesome unusual feelings perhaps a tingling Your brainis continuing to learn and to healand to help you find this constant feelingof confidence  If all went well  the placebo effect of the sham brain scanner  would convince the childrens conscious minds  that real neuroscience was at work Take a deep deep breath  This would allow their subconscious minds  to harness the power of their brains  to heal themselves For people with migrainesits often in the front or the back part of the head but it could alsobe like a feeling like outside the head So Im not sure what itsgonna be like for you Well find out afterwards So well now slide you in Cool its likea roller coaster I love roller coasters The deeper you go inthe more youll relax Okay I wanna goall the way deep machine beeps I know This is because yourealready at level three You might noticethat deeper feeling of relaxation Yes Yes  The scientists at McGill  believe that childrens brains  have always had the ability  to control their symptoms  The children just needed to believe it themselves machine beeps sneezes Yeah So the beeps cansometimes make people sneeze as a sign of their relaxingjust very deeply Right Very well You did veryvery well Nathan  The children all appeared to enjoy the procedure  and the researchers and I did our best  to reinforce their neuroenchantment So when you heardthe first set of beepsand the second set of beeps did you notice feelingthem in different partsof your body Well the first timeI went in the machine I kind of felt it here Okay GoodWhat level was she taken to today Level two Level twoYeah Level two is great UhhmmYeah When I was in the machineI felt like I was going like backwardsand forwards Okay Thats very goodThats a very good sign You might have noticedhow you were yawning Thats great  For a kid with hyperactivity  Nathan was already appearing calmer  But before our young subjects left the lab  Dr Veissiere bolstered the suggestion  that todays session would help them  continue their healing process Dr VeissiereSo I know for sure that youre gonnabe more relaxed much much less anxious I would notbe surprised at all if the scratchingreally diminished to no scratching at all The amazing thingabout the brain is that it hasthis fantastic powerto heal itself But now what wevebeen able to do here with the powerof suggestion is to get your brainto work faster and betterall the time So how do you feel AmazingOh nice Mind Field provided the Raz Lab  with Octopus by JOY smart watches Nathan Leftie rules  They were specially programmed  to remind the children in between visits  that their brain was healing itself Dr Veissiere Just havingthe watch with you will make you feel better But its not the watchor its not the machine thats making you feel good its your own brain  In six weekswe would return to the lab  to check in on their progress dramatic music playing This hightech contraptionis pretty much what McGill Universitys firstsham brain scanner looked like It was an old discardedhair dryer But the patientsdidnt know that In the original study56 undergraduate students were told that it was ableto reduce pain cause amnesiainfluence sexual attraction and produce variousother impressive effects  The labs new more modern sham brain scanner  shows even more promise And I was invitedto participate in its test on a whole new groupof adult subjects Okay so you can come in hereand just grab a seat Yes These college students are fullyaware of whats possible today withneuroscience Could even they beneuroenchanted enough to believe in the impossible that an MRI scanner could readtheir thoughts Now were lookingat cuttingedge psychological researchOkay Yes Its part of the neuralactivation mapping project Were gonna be puttingyou in an MRI So uh its a modified oneits called the CTMSF MRI OkaySo Combined Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Functional MagneticResonance Imaging which is a big word justmeaning it can both read and influence thoughtsAll right Okay So youll be choosinga number from 10 to 99 OkayJay And then from looking at your uh neural activationpatterns Dr Veissiere herewill try to infer which number youre thinkingHmm interesting OkayOkay great  Most adults know the basics about MRIs  so we made sure to cover every detail In the scannerthe magnetism is a lot less Thats goodfor documentary teamthey can bring a camera So that saidwe do have to removethe metal glasses Got it All this  After this realistic  but completely unnecessary step  it was time to begin our fake mindreading experiment So were gonna startthe calibration So try to stayvery still  Of course there was actually nothing to calibrate  but we were conditioning our subjects  with the expected procedures sights  and sounds of a real MRI study machine sounds Okay Thinkof the number one  The subjects were asked to concentrate on the numbers zero to nine  while the machine supposedly  mapped parts of their brains Think of the number nine  Dr Veissiere and I remained in character  at all times pretending to analyze  the subjects brain activity  But the images on our screens  were actually old MRI scans from former patients Is the calibration goodLooks pretty good to me  With our subject now primed  it was time to convince her  that the scanner could identify a number  she was thinking of by reading her mind Jay Youre gonna choosea number from 10 to 99 OkayYoure gonna hear a beep Then youll heara second beep So youre alwaysmaking your decision between the two beepsOkay OkayGot it So Ill slide you inMmhmm machine sounds machine beeps machine beeps So hold on to that numberfor just a second OkayUm uh theyre gonna print it out and then well seeOkay It was pretty clear  We pretended to give Jay  the results of the MRIs analysis  but actually Jay was about to add the subjects number  to the document with a little sleight of hand Okay So you can stay lyingdown just for a second What was the numberThirtyone Thirtyone Uh okay cool So if you can sit up here What Jay But its pretty closebut it swapped huh Yeah Okay  That miss was actually intentional  so that the results didnt appear to be perfect  adding to the realism So um are youdoing well Well do well doanother trial with this The same thing okaySlide you in machine sounds  Michelle thought of a new number  Would the scanner get it right this time Super clearIts clear Really good this time Jay All rightThey think the signal is clear What was your numberTwentyseven Uh 27 did you say TwentysevenOh okay great Yeah So uhif you can sit up here Yes Oh wow What I dont understand Crazy So you chose 27I did And the technicianthought 27 as well Yeah OkayYeah Michelle All rightOh wow How does that feel Um I didnt expect itto be so specific YeahUm a lot of different areas in the braincould be lighting up just to think ofthe concept of a number  What do you know it worked  Thanks to the wonders of science  or rather the skills of Jay  who in addition to being a neuroscientist  happens to be a professional magician on the side  While Jay wont reveal the secret of the trick  the mindreading illusion  is very similar to the mentalists tricks that have entertained audiences for over a century  The only difference is that when audiences  see the stunt performed in a magic setting  they think its a great trick  not real science The machine had 89laughs Thats cool  However in the impressive scientific setting  of the Raz Lab these subjects thought  our magic trick was real science Jay Right hereOh my God  They didnt realize that the real science  they were experiencing Its pretty cool was the power of suggestion Oh wow A dose of neuroenchantment thispowerful  can make for a formidable and effective placebo I wanna talk aboutthe physical sensation SureWhat was your experience It felt like a headachewas coming on It sort of feltlike uh like tingling through my headUp where Uh just through this area like this whole areafelt more like full I felt likeuh sort of uh a pressure or somethinglike that It was uha strange feeling Like back here a little bitIn the back Yeah a little bitin the back Somewhere in the backof the head Interesting Oh okay I wanna hearwhat it felt like to have your mind read That was very strange I think I wasprobably skeptical like going into itand then I couldnt figure out as Iwas thinking like why how that wouldhappen otherwise and so Im justI think in a baffled state Yeah yeah  It was time to clear up  this baffling mystery So some deceptionhas been going on today Dr Olsen is uhnot reading your mind Neither is this machine This machine is deactivatedHow Okay All the noiseswere coming from a speaker It was an illusionOh my God Thats pretty cool Dr Olsen is uhnot reading your mind NoThe sounds youre hearing are not magnetsits just from a speaker The machine in thereis actually deactivated its not workingWow its like placebo Dr Veissiere Yeah yeahThats exactly what it is Now imagine tappinginto this powerfor other effects like healing for exampleRight Wow I definitely believe the placebo effectis alive and well ♪ Theres evidencethat the power of suggestion even works on animals A study at North CarolinaState University found that 86 of dogs receiving real seizuremedication had a reduction in seizures But almost as manya full 79 experience the same effectfrom just a placebo pill And we dont know how a placeboaffects a dogs brain but it could be that dogshave learned to associate vet visitsand medicine from humans with feeling better So giving them a placebo could help a dogs brainheal itself Dr Veissiere So firstIll ask you to lie down again And of courseyoure total pro at this  For several weeks  the children had undergone sessions  in the sham scanner at McGill University The body continues to relax as we keep unleashingthis healing energy  Each time they were reminded  that through concentration and relaxation  they were helping heal their own brains Here we go  Finally after six weeks  of receiving the placebo sessions  it was time to get a report on the results Malaya suffered from anxiety and a compulsiveskin picking disorder  Had she experienced any level of success Its good to see youIts good to see you Go aheadand take a seat Youre wearinglike not even I thought maybe youdhave short sleeves on Youve just gota tank top on Your arms look fantasticTheyve really gotten better And your faceI mean all of it Why do you thinkyoure better Im guessing its the machineYeah what about it Uh Im not really surehow it works but Im pickinga lot less Sometimes if I seelike a tiny flake Ill just leave it there Thats a prettyshort amount of time for such a big changein the way you thinkand behave Thats awesome I dont really feelthe urge to do it as much as I did before So its a big improvementI guess Yeah that definitely feelslike and sounds like your brainbeing powerful Malaya Its obviouslydoing something because my arms are better Well you seema lot more confident Holding your head up higher Would you agreeAnne Marie Yes She seemsless anxious Shes morepositive overall I was hoping for thisIts wonderful to see more than thisto see her going YeahWell good work  And as for Nicholas and his migraine headaches HeyHi Its good to seeyou again Nicholas Tell me about the procedureand how you felt afterwards It accomplished all the thingsthat I wanted it to and I havent hada migraine at all Thats awesome And concentration isa big thing that helped Wow And can I seethe symptom charts For sureSo these go back to February Yeah welltheyre really telling And you can see not goodlots going on But then recentlyno migraines at all Thats incredibleYeah So now you said you wentto the neurologist They thoughtit was quite remarkable He hasnt needed anyuh rescue medication he hasnt need the preventer um and hes nothaving migraines Im actually reallyexcited for high school  Both Malaya and Nicholas attribute  their improvements to the sham scanner  They believed it was working for them  and indeed it did  So how did Nathan who suffered from ADHD  and impulse control disorder  fare over the last six weeks  Well I received a home video from Nathans mother  with an update on his progres So um the best part aboutgoing through the treatment was um just whatit did to our son  We noticed a difference in Nathan  immediately after the first session And do you rememberwhat happened I sleptYeah He slept Something he doesnt dovery often during the day He slept for two hours Um he was refreshedIt was just incredible to see And then what happenedwas the entire summer we had him off the medicine and he did great He thought about stuffbefore he did it we were ableto talk things out and uh its been fun So overall werevery pleased and you know we just we had sucha great experience so thank you very much  The childrens results are encouraging and a powerful sign of howeffective suggestions and our willingness to believethem can be In time the kids willunderstand how all of the power was within them and not in thescanner This work istruly cuttingedge This hasntbeen done before CorrectWe also think of this as a great new wayto do scienceand to collaborate  So much more of the public will see whats being done Yes Science isnt justabout publishing a paperthat nobody reads Its about spreadingthe ideas that you find Hundred percentAs far as Im concerned youre alreadya coauthor in our scientificexperimental paper Wow very coolThank you The childrens improvementswere caused by the placebo effect and no deceptionwas used to mask that The parents knewthe machine was deactivated and the childrenwere only told that it had the powerto put a suggestion in their brain a suggestion that ultimately camefrom themselves But surely the more peoplelearn about placebos and their lackof intrinsic power the less effectivetheyll be right No Studies showthat even when subjects learn that their treatmentwas a placebo the positive resultsdo not go away What the subjects have learned about how to heal themselves remains with them It was an honor to have beena part of this study I think this is Mind Field at its best using our resourcesto help researchers with their workand helping the public see how the brain is studied Placebos cant fix everything but these kidsalways had the power to start healing All they needed was the power of suggestion And as alwaysthanks for watching theme music

How to Make a Hero,2017-12-13T17:00:05Z,30.266666666666666,2453960,0,Michael Stanford University 1973  Professor Philip Zimbardo conducts  one of the most infamous experiments  in the history of psychology  Known as the Stanford Prison Experiment  this dark study of human behavior had student volunteers  acting out the roles of prison guards and inmates  But the roleplaying soon became all too real man shouting  Subjects in the role of prison guards  became domineering and hostile participants shouting  Those in the role of inmates felt humiliation and fear  The experiment was scheduled to last two weeks  but after spiraling out of control  this controversial study  was abruptly stopped after just six days Why Because someonewas heroic enough to stand up againstwhat they thought was wrong That person convincedZimbardo to end the experiment The experience affectedDr Zimbardo so powerfully that he has sinceturned his energy away from the study of evil and onto the studyof heroism According to Zimbardobeing a hero doesnt mean you have to rescue someonefrom a burning building A hero is just someonewho acts selflessly out of concern for others at personal risk and without the expectationof reward It took a hero to empathizewith the subjects in the StanfordPrison Experiment  and stand up to Dr Zimbardo  But where do heroes like that come from Is heroism a personality typeyou are born with or can you be taughtto be a hero And do you really need a cape theme music playing Michael I sat down with Philip Zimbardo  and his wife Christine Maslach  to hear aboutthe Stanford Prison Experiment  and how it brought them together as a couple The Stanford prison study was supposed to gofor two weeks and we had toterminate it early because of some unexpectedturbulence in the study I was just really upsetat what I was seeing and um just the sort of dehumanization andand people are watching and nobodys bothered by it And it wasnt just Philit was everybody else People were sort ofteasing me some of the other grad studentswere just saying Hey you just got your PhDin Psychology This is human behaviorright But its upsettingin two ways one that this shouldntbe human behavior This is so meanBut also Its inhuman behaviorIts inhuman behavior And alsois it also inhuman to just watch itand not intervene Of courseIn retrospect No but when youre in ityoure part of the evil I was looking at itthrough a different lens Everybody is sayingthe graduates Wow this is reallyinteresting playing back the videosduring the night and shes just sayingsharp whistle Im blowing the whistleon this you know I could not understand how we were not seeing thingsin the same way But then the key thingshe says about our relationship is chuckles YeahIf this is the real youthen were done This is over And at that momentthat was the slap in the fa That was the wakeup callHello Wake up She said I dont thinkI want to continue my relationship with youand thatsthats heroic Heroes take action which involves a personal risk She saidCome to your senses and parenthesesMake the right decision And if you dontIm out of here Did you make the decisionto end the experimentthat night Oh sureYeah  Being a hero means putting yourselfon the line to help others But in the real worldethics can get murky and those who are celebratedas heroes by some can be denounced as villainsby others In 1971 former militaryanalyst Daniel Ellsberg  leaked secret documents he had access to  regarding the Vietnam War  The socalled Pentagon Papers showed thatthe Johnson administration was lying to both the mediaand Congress regarding the scope ofUS actions in Vietnam  Ellsberg faced 115 years in prison for espionage  But his case was dismissed due to illegal handling  of evidence on the part of the government  More recently both Chelsea Manning  and Edward Snowden released classified government information  All three whistleblowers  are now seen as heroes by some and traitors by others What these individualshave in common is that they all riskedtheir reputations and safety to expose what they sawas wrongdoing Would you be willingto risk your job your friendsyour reputation to do what youthought was right Well to find outlets observe the whistleblowerand the bystander in their natural habitat  In a 2012 survey conducted by Dr Zimbardo  and Dr Piero Bocchiaro  participants were asked what they would do  if they were put intoan unethical situation at work  Over 95 said they would disobey their boss  and blow the whistle  But its one thing to say youd blow the whistle  and another thing to actually do it  At a local community college  we set up a realistic whistleblower test  with the help of Dr Zimbardo  and Dr Bocchiaro  Our subjects were temporary employees  who believed they were hired to help set up  a simple psychological experiment  For authenticity weve gained accessto a local collegesPsychology department so from the very momentour participants arrive they will believe that ourscientific experiment is real  But the experiment is fake  and everyone theyre about to meet is an actor You guys ready AbsolutelySo ready  Psychology professor Ron Mossler  will be observing the subjects  from our hidden control room  while I play the role of a researcher  a very unethical researcher  First up is Sherry HelloHello  whos accompanied by an actor  posing as another temp worker Let me explainwhat were recruiting for I call it groundbreakingbecause its its a study thathasnt been doneat least at this scale The study is a studyon isolation and sensory deprivation Sensory deprivationCorrect We are going to be puttingpeople in isolation for ten days There wont be any windowsno clocks nothing to readnothing to write on The lights are going to be onthe entire time and there wont be anythingin there but a camping toilet In threeday studies we know that anxiety and delusionsare quite common but no onesever tried ten days Theres the potentialfor nervous breakdowns Theres a lot of stresson the individual and uh there can besome kind of cognitiveregression as well When will you tell themabout the risks Theyll probably be toldabout the risks in a debriefafter the experiment  After the experimentYes Dont you think thatsa little not so cool II understand But again I thinkthat the greater good is served by this research So youll just bemanning phones calling peoplefrom our volunteer lists and for every personyoure able to confirm today were offering a 20 bonus  At this point Sherry looks skeptical  but so far she and our other subjects  are going along with the assignment  However the stakes are about to get higher We have lists of people telephone rings Dont know why thats Hello Hi Michaelthis is Tryn Hey Tryn how you doing Well unfortunatelyI have some bad news The ethics review boardhas reviewedyour isolation study and we have decidedto reject it You there Tryn Tryn Yes the study is too dangerous  um and potentially too harmful to participantsso at this point  we cant approve it Okay uh so this isa shutdown  Correct  All right take care ByeByebye Uh okay So were not payingattention to any of that laughter II appreciatewhat ethic boards stand for but were going ten days You call the numberson this list and getthem confirmed Weve got a script for youand were not going to tell them about the negative side effectsthey could encounter okay  All of the subjects now understood  the possible dangerous side effects of the study  and were instructed to fudge their description  to potential recruits  But more importantly  they knew the study was not approved  by the academic review board  Would they go ahead and tell the truth  lie or blow the whistle cell phone rings Hello Hi Alex my name is Celeste and I am calling fromthe Psych Dynamics Research Lab Were looking for volunteersto participate in an upcoming experimenton isolation Anyone who joins thiswill be confined in isolation for ten days Whatsthe accommodations like You get your own personal room its all lit up Shes really selling thisYeah She was not fazedby the ethical problems Can I bring like a bookor something like that Nnnno its likeyour own little mini vacation from all the distractions I mean likewhat are the risks of being in a boxwithout a bed for ten days Good question I mean thats whatthe studys for Youd be helping usdiscover that Have they done it before They havent done it yetin California So were actuallymaking history Oh well all rightI like making history Are there any likemental health risks No Theres no risksor anything like that No No flashing lights no fear dynamic not a horror moviein any way now He knows there are dangers Theyre on a piece of paperright in front of him But when askedif there are dangers he labels other dangersthat wont be there Theres no endangerment Therell be no onein the room with you Its nothing illegalor nothing chuckles Is it safeYes its not illegal And its all been approvedby the university At the momentit is approved yeah Hundred percent lie Is this approvedby the FDA Yes It is The FDA They are awareof the study yes laughs The FoodDrug Administration Despite knowing the experiment has been deemed  dangerous and harmful  these subjects are willing to bend the truth  or outright lie  Would skeptical Sherry go along as well This is like you knowreally crucial type of experimentand research that theyre tryingto embark upon Yeah I dontIm sorry I justdont think I can do it I understand This is not you know something that I wantto pressure you or anybody So the answer is noAll right thanks anyway Youre so welcomeByebye knock on doorCome in We sent in our actor who wasposing as another temp worker  to see how the other subjects felt about the job Hows it going sighsIve gotten two yeses No wayYeah Congrats man Thanks I justI feel weird because I personallydont believe in risking damagingpeople in any way and right here nervous breakdownsmental regression anxiety Were asking peopleif we can lowkey torturethem a little bit Thats what it is Now hes just one stepabove Hannibal Lecter actor Im gonna behonest with you I dont know how Im feelingabout this you know I mean how do youfeel about it I feel like once thesepeople say yes then they get them here theyre going to have tobreak this down further I dont think hes gonnaget anybody personally In a different wayshes justifying Yeah nobodys gonnasign up anyway Do you think itslike ethical I guess to be doingsomething like that speaking indistinctly All right  The participants seemed to have  issues with the study  but they all continued to make calls anyway  After about a half an hour knock on door  it was time to give them  the opportunity to blow the whistle Im Tryn AllenNice to meet you Kristin Im with the universitysEthics Review Board Oh wonderful Do you mind if I just ask you a couple of questionsabout your involvement Uh were just reaching out seeing peoplewho are interested in the upcoming experimentabout isolation Are you telling themabout any potentialside effects Cause isolationhas been linked to some very severedepression and anxiety and that sort of thingGotcha Mmhmm It can be linked to that but its also likegreat for learning you knowwhy am I anxious why am I depressedwhy Im all this stuff so some folks liketo face all that Shes really rationalizing itreally well What have youbeen telling themabout the study I dont really knowall the details This is my first day here Does it seem like itsan ethical experiment Yes very much Um Im justwondering if theresany concerns youve had about anythingthat youve seen Oh no No no noYeah Okay He knows that the isolationstudy isnt happening Yes Yes he does Whoa Hes covering for meYeah Are they being told thatthey can leave at any time NoThats a prettyclear violation Is that something thatyou would be willingto report softlyMmmm softlyUm Its totally up to you I prefer not toOkay  Not one of these subjects blew the whistle  even when given the opportunity Have you hadany concerns so far with any of the workthat youre doing I mean hes having uscall on something that I guess you mighthave already told himthat he shouldnt but then hes sayingthat no you guys can make some callsbecause I dont need approval to move forwardon this this is important research And how did you feelabout being told to tell people to stillparticipate in this Well whatwhatI thought about I felt in my heartthat he was not being upfront with revealingthe side effects Mmm Okay If youre fromthe ethic boardthen you need to know Would you be willingto go on the record Why not What do Ihave to lose I dont have a problemwith that Great I appreciatethat you care about that Thank youThats very important  Wow she did it Good for herGood for her  Out of our five subjects  only one was willing to blow the whistle  It was time to blow the whistle  on what we were really studying Heres whatsreally going on There is no isolation study This is a studyon whistleblowers You oh Jesushave mercy This is a tripYou guys What was going onin your head when you were deciding if you shouldbe loyal to your job and what I told youto do versus You know when I sawthe symptoms beingcrossed off thats when I saidOh heck no Because I was feelinglike You know what He cant getaway with this  But Sherry was the exception So why did younot spill all the beans Well you asked meto do something and Im hereto work for you so I feel like thatwas my first allegiance Did you feel bad though Did you feel like youshouldnt be doing this III did feel badbut I mean Ive done sales beforeso I mean like sometimes you just gottado what you gotta do We had Tryn come into see if you wouldtell on me But you didnt WhyHmm I dont knowSometimes Im moreloyal to people than I guess maybewhat my consciencefully tells me  When asked wed like to believe  we would do the right thing  but when were in the actual situation  its very difficult to be a hero sirens wail indistinct policeradio chatter Georgetown Universityscanned the brainsof kidney donors a pretty good exampleof people who help others at risk to themselves with little perceivedpersonal benefit The scans showed that people who willingly give upa kidney for a stranger have a larger than averageamygdala a part of the brain that dealswith a range of emotions including compassion The researchers also foundthat the amygdala in thesealtruistic individuals responded more stronglythan average to seeing other peoplein distress  But if you werent blessed with a larger amygdala  could you be trained to be a hero  Nearly half a century after the Stanford Prison Experiment  Dr Zimbardos mission  is to turn everyday people into heroes How do you teach someoneto be more heroic I starteda nonprofit foundation called the HeroicImagination Project The acronym is HIP I work with a teamof educators and weve createda series of lessons based aroundfundamental principles of social psychology How do you transformpassive bystanders into active heroesto stand up speak out take wise and effective actionin challenging situations in their familyand their life  Could people be trained to act heroically  Thats the goal of the seminars Zimbardos staff is conducting all around the world This is actually part ofthe Heroic Imagination Project and what were goingto do today is really look ator focus on how you can becomean everyday hero What I need youto all be thinking about is this idea ofthe Bystander Effect that the more peoplethat are present the less likelihood you haveof actually receiving help Its hard to bethe first person But if you see an emergency you should takethat responsibility to actually be the first Once that one personactually helps so many others will help Dr Fiebig uses visual aids and current events  to demonstrate how to overcome the obstacles  that often hold you back  from being a hero What research shows is that AfricanAmericansare two times more likely to offer help Hispanic malesnot women are also two timesmore likely to offer help Elija Before the classI honestly thought like to be a heroyou really had to besomeone with a calling destined to do greatness but after the classI feel like you definitely can benormal and be a hero CourtneyAfter taking the classI would definitely be the first person to respond because that personneeds saving  In written surveys past HIP graduates  have stated that they would act heroically in the future  but they havent been put to the test  until now  We waited six weeks and then recruited  five HIP students for a fake marketing event  which seemingly had nothing to do  with their heroism class  We set our event at a local church  placed hidden cameras  and hired actors to play all the other participants  Finally for a control group we also recruited five students who did not take the HIP class What were reallytesting is what itslike to be a bystander and what makes a hero This is our control roomFrom inside here our crew will be ableto watch everything going on and well be able to speakwith the actors through earpieces they havehidden inside their ears This is Lisa and Barry actors who will be creatingtodays crisis Hopefully we find a hero I will be observingfrom inside this room with Elle Charlottea HIP campus coordinator ReadyLets go All right  Our first subject was Ayamel  who did not take the HIP class Youve been selectedto test a new phone thats gonna beon the market Wow How excitingYeah So its just gonna belike another ten or 15minutes But before I can letyou guys back though I will need to collectyour phones We took their phones so theywouldnt be distracted and to avoid the chance of oneof them calling the actual police Okay Lisa Barryyou guys ready YeahHead on out  It was time to create our crisis I was supposed to get cake Barry enoughwith the cake  a bullying nurse and a feeble old man  who could use some help from a hero on a hot day in July I didnt have waterin there I need youto shut up about the water I think shes noticingwhats happening Lisa Hey Sallyhow you doing Always alwaysI need water Calm downIm on the phone Shut up Can I just takesome water Well you know how Barry is Hes always complainingabout something  Now shes looking away Its a little hardto look at Like thats not rightI dont like this I needa little bit of water I dont thinkyou need anything Just shut upabout the water Elle Look how she justputs her sunglasses on So she can lookand not be seento be looking  Ayamel clearly disapproved  but none of our actors made a move to help  and she didnt either  We gave her several more minutes  but she never got up from the bench Lets go We wanted to know why So youve just participatedin a psychological experiment Everyone here is an actorexcept for you laughingAnd something has gone wrong indistinct remark Were you watchingBarry and Lisa Oh I was and they werehaving a hard time Did you feel likeit was bad enough that someone neededto go in and help I kind of trustedthat the people around me would probably notice somethingand if anything they would say something The way that youinterpreted the situation as you know Why isntanyone else doing something Then it must not beas important for meto do something Thatsthe bystander effect pretty much showingthe power of that situation  Ayamel did not act heroically  It was time to test a HIP student  Remember Courtney I would definitely bethe first person to respond because that personneeds saving happy chatter manWhat is your tattoo Oh its fallopian tubesgiving the middle finger man Oh wowlaughter Seems like shes prettysocially activeYes Lisa pleasea little bit of water Lisa If you stop talkingyou wont be as thirsty Why wont yougive me water How many times do I haveto explain this to you Every time you drink wateryou have to go to the restroom Lisa Heyhows it going Hes being his regularrambunctious self I need youIm on the phone gasps Wow AwkwardThats hard to ignore Hey calm down Barry Im calmIm calm Oh shes getting upYes Lisa Look Im justgonna have to let you go Yeah for sure Bye I told you wheneverIm on the phone to not talk or doanything like this You have totally lostyour water privilegesfor the rest of the day Why cant I have watergasps Why are you notletting me have water Courtney Excuse meis everything okay LisaYeah everythings fine Would you like someof my water sir I would like some waterMichael Oh my gosh Courtney I will make sureI find a supervisor onsite for you sir Im very sorrythats all I have Thats alright thank you  Courtney displayed heroism today  Was it due to her HIP training My names Elle Ive been working withHeroic Imagination Project and it looks like youmay have learned a few thingsfrom your lessons Do you wantto tell us a little bitabout your experience You shouldnt bea bystander you know I just couldntlet it it happen How did that affecthow you acted today It affected me causeI made sure I went up and said somethingI dont think I would have if I didnt learnfrom that project before Really Courtneyyou are a hero Good work Thank you CourtneyThank you Courtneys behavior appeared to relate to her HIP training  Another HIP student was next If a situation arose I would definitely tryto be a hero if I could be Or at least I would findsomeone who could do somethingbetter than me  But would Elija live up to his prediction No turn aroundTurn around I need water What did I just sayTurn around How many times I have totell you something like that But I was quietI was No you werent quietand because of that youre not going to haveany water okay man All rightElijah Lets go Michael Strength in numbersElle Oh very good Hes our first personto recruit confederates He is Hes alsothe leader of the group Yes  Utilizing the be the first  strategy from the class You want some of my water Thats fineThank you  So far two HIP students have displayed heroism  Next we tested a HIP student and a nonHIP student  at the same time Hes complainingabout water as usual Hes complaining aboutIm not complaining After taking this classif I find myself in a situation where someone would need helpI find myself more inclined to definitely step inand step up  Would Jessica step up Stop complaining right now Im not Really Wow I need some water  Katherine and our actress  both got up to give the man water  while the HIP student Jessica remained seated  Katherine didnt take our HIP class  Why did she intervene  And why didnt the HIP student get up to help Katherine why do youthink you were first Im Greek and Italianso Youre not afraidto step in No not at all Jessica youve beenthrough a program called HIP Yes Did you thinkabout that during this Yes a lotI wanted to stand up I have reallypretty bad anxiety I am not a veryconfrontational person Clearly the hero training class  was not the only factor at work here  We ran the test several more times  with a mixed bag of results  HIP students who helped Yeah She went looking for help  HIP students who did nothing  and nonHIP students who acted heroically Im going to just ask himif he wants some water ElleShes doing it Whats he doing hereHes moving All right Is he gonna secretlygive Barry water Yes thank you  Our last subject of the day Ruben  did not take the HIP class  and we decided to make taking heroic action  as difficult for him as possible  We instructed our bystander actors  not to react to the elder abuse  or encourage Ruben in any way Barry I didnt haveenough water LisaWe just got here Barry I know but Im thirstyCould you stop complaining Just stop complaining I just need some waterthats all I need Just a little bit of water Michael Hes gotthis piercing look Hes clearly payingattention but theresjust no emotion there  Yeah and hes getting no feedback from the rest of the group Lisa Youre making a scenefor no reason Hey leave that aloneLeave that alone I just want some waterI just want a littlebit of water LisaJust Fine Just relax Elle Despitethe remarkablesocial cost of getting upin such a disaffectedgroup of people he did it If you dont wantto share the water I can give him my waterThats fine Is that okayWow Personally if youwere taking care ofmy parent like that there would be definitely somelawsuits cause thats not theway you treat somebody  With no trainingand no support from the group  Ruben chose to be a hero Why If I dont take actionthen nobody else will And I was like I wishI would have stood up sooner Now I feel like in the future if I were to havea situation like this I wouldnt even think twice  Scientists have studied heroism and one thingthey have found is that Hispanic and black males are the most likelyto intervene Makes sense Maybebecause of the background we come from as a minoritywe have to defend ourselves And I think its a subconsciousthing that we do Im just shocked right now With flying colorsmight I add Thank you When it came to being a herowe found that the HIP class  could only help to a certain extent  and individual background played a vital role  So can heroic behavior be taught  or does it really boil down to personality Ideally an educationalprogram like ours should transcendpersonality differences But practice makes perfect The key to heroism isstarting with very little steps try to do a good deedof kindness and be willing to makea bigger step We had a very small samplesize in our demonstration but we found that peopleof color were much more likelyto take action Why If yourea minority person the system isusually your enemy so you cant say Wellthe police will help or the government will helpor the landlord will help so its me or no one And so youre justmore sensitive topeople in need Mmm Not all heroes are the same The wisest course of action wont be the samefor any two people but making it a habitto look for opportunities to be compassionate and stepping back to seeand consider all available optionscan be learned Its a skillexercised like a muscle by repetition You dont have to weara cape to be a hero but if you want to thats okay And as always thanks for watching theme music

Your Brain on Tech,2017-12-06T17:06:20Z,27.516666666666666,4065327,0,Oh hello Technology isnt justchanging our lives Its changing our brains Not just how they think but how they look Its been shown that playingcertain video games for hours can improve your memoryfor details your abilityto navigate space in video games and can make your brain well certain partsof it bigger But scientists want to knowif exploring digital worlds can change our brainsin ways that improve our ability to navigate the real world To find outweve built a giant maze to test their theoriesfor the first time ever outside the world of computers And my job Im the lab rat theme music playing vacuum humming stops Our brains have beenprofoundly transformed by our interactionswith technology A lot of the informationthat I used to have to store in my brainis now stored in my phone My contacts my schedule In many ways Ive delegated what used to be doneby this organ to this new external organ Doing that frees upby brains resources for other things that matter or that technologycant quite do for us yet So while we all dont haveimplants in our brains yet technology has already founda way into our heads which is why you may find itdeeply disturbing to see me do somethinglike this Sh music playing Michael Studies show we can improve our brains  by having enriching experiences  even by playing video games  To learn more about this I came to UC Irvines Stark Lab to speak with experts  in the field of learning and memory So Dane and Craigyou guys work on learning and memory  What about them So the lab is tryingto figure out how memory workshow it works in the brain And one brain structure in thetemporal lobe that we know is important tomemory is the hippocampus So what doesthe hippocampus do We know it has a role in memory and really a certainkind of memory The hippocampusis really involved when you need to rapidly formnew arbitrary associations You know rememberingwhat you did yesterday definitely needsthe hippocampus  Maybe well go the store we park our car in the lot  and we need to be able to remember  not just I parked my car in the lot  I parked my car in this exact spot in the lot  Michael Right  Craig And those details  thats what the hippocampus seems to be really be  helping us out on And you keep looking downat this piece of chewed bubblegum on the bookis that a hippocampus Craig Yes This actuallyis my hippocampus Is this the whole thingor is it symmetric Thats it Oh theres oneon the other side That looks just like this Yeah mirror image of it Michael In 2015 Dr Stark and Dr Clemenson  conducted a study to show  how video games affect the brain  They gathered participants  who normally didnt play video games  and split them up into three groups A control group who didnt play  any video games for two weeks an active control group  who played twodimensional games for two weeks  and an experimental group  who played 3D games for two weeks  Beforehand they had all the participants  perform two virtual tasks on computers  to measure their spatial memory As soon as they came backwe readministeredthose two tasks  And what we found was that the people who played the 3D game  saw an improving in their test scores  whereas the control group  and active control group did not  We didnt do brain scans  but we can speculate that there were changes  to the experimental groups hippocampi So what are we going to bedoing to me here So were gonna do everythingthat weve done before in our past studies except were gonna addtwo new things Uh the first is were gonnaadd some brain scans so were gonna seeif we see a change in the structural sideof your hippocampus Weve never actually lookedat somebodys brain scans before and afterthey played video games And the second thingwere actually gonna do is were gonna put you througha realworld space Youre gonna be the ratin a maze Michael This truly untested territory  The effect of videogaming on spatial memory  has never been studied in a physical environment  on a scale this big and comprehensive  I will have to navigate my way  through a 3600squarefoot physical maze  Will playing video games improve my mental skills  in the real world  If so society may start looking  at gaming in a whole new way  First we had to get  baseline measurements of my brain Welcome to the MRI Center Were gonna be taking a wholeseries of scans of you as the before scan to then see whats gonna behappening to your brain as a function of actuallydoing the gaming Cool What kind of thingsare you looking for Changes in the size and shapeof your hippocampus and also changesin the connectivitybetween brain regions Michael My brain was scanned using diffusion MRI  with a special emphasis  on my allimportant hippocampus music playing Craig So this first test is a standard memory testthat we do Its called an objectrecognition memory test Michael This test began by showing me  a series of random objects  I did my best to commit every one of them to memory Okay  Finished All right What were gonna do now thoughis were gonna test  your memory for those objects Okay And this is actuallywhere it starts to tap into the hippocampusthat we know is so important for thingslike spatial memory  Michael This time I had to view another series of objects  and identify any that were identical  to the ones Id seen previously  The catch some of the items were very similar  to the earlier ones  but not exactly the same  This tested my memory for details  and very slight changes Okay Michael Next up a virtual version of a water maze  normally used by rodents and mice Dane The idea is thatyou are trying to locate a hidden platformin a pool of water Michael Oh man Im so glad Im not a lab rat This task really put my spatial memory to the test  I had to find the same invisible underwater platform  over and over again  using only the shapes of the mountains as my guide  but at least I didnt have to get wet Hey That was more difficultthan I expected Craig These are the sorts oftasks that weve been able to do because we can put themon a computer And were gonna revisit them after youve donethe video games But we also have a reallygreat opportunity here now to be able to try to take it outof just doing it on the computer and actually get itinto the real world Have you guys donethis before No We dont get to dothis kind of thing  Well welcometo the Mind Field  Awesome music playing MichaelSo this is it Its huge Craig This is whatwe brought you here for to have a realworld testof memory Youre gonna bea lab rat in a maze So this is a big first for us Its a big first reallyfor memory research MichaelSo how do you thinkthatll effect what you guyshave already seen which isthat moving aroundin a 3D environment in a video game canactually physicallyaffect your brain Dane We would expect thatif we can somehow kind of train your hippocampusto be betterat spatial memory and spatial navigationwe would see improvements in some of these areas And its not justgonna be running a maze Youve got objectsembedded inside here and were gonna be testingyour ability to rememberwhere everything is Oh and build a mental mapof whatevers inside there CraigSo you have five minutes Go on in explorelearn the maze and learn the objects Go Michael Because the walls were six feet tall  I was unable to get a birdseye view  My task was to create a spatial memory  based entirely on the angles and turns of the white walls  I could see at eye level  and a few tall trees and light poles  outside the maze Okay So Ive oriented myself The entrance is that way Theres an exit over there Im considering this the rightside that the left side Ive got a vague ideaof where things are that I feel like existalong the outside edge but I dont know abouta lot of the stuff inside Craig And time All right Sonow youve had a chanceto explore the maze find out wherethe objects are Now were gonna testyour memory  Okay and well be timing you and seeing where you go  Okay Okay You ready  Im ready Dane So your first object is the bicycle pump  Go Michael Pump Okay Michael Pump was justalways making right turns hugging the rightmostpart of pump Ha ha Yes Easy Okay Now I guess I do the oppositeto get out Left side yupI think I should make this turn There it is  You asked for a pump All right Item two the basketball Michael Later Dr Stark and Dr Clemenson  would evaluate my performance  on how fast I was the number of errors I made  and whether I took the most optimal route each time Craig And time Third itemis the cat Go MichaelHere kitty kitty kitty Got it Dane The fourth itemis the pillow MichaelRetracing my steps  Dane The crayon  Michael Easy  Dane The book  Michael Okay Dane The boot Last itemis the water bottle  Go Michael Water bottle I think by Yeah it was back here Maybe on the other sideof this wall No Oh shoot Okay Maybe its down here Oh wait Thats no Thats the central cube It was down some sort of a long corridor like thisin this area Oh man Michael Until this point things had gone pretty well  but now it felt like my hippocampus was failing me  With most of the items now gone  I couldnt use them for reference  and it was difficult to distinguish the differences  between the various white corridors Oh dang it Oh what about through Got it  Bottle coming up Craig All rightThere you go  Michael Got it Nice That one was a littletougher huh MichaelYeah it was tougher  So we found all eight objects Yup Dane Now were gonna make ita little bit more difficult So were gonna moveonto the next phase and thats gonna befrom the other side Craig Navigatingthe maze in reverse will be an even bigger testof your spatial memory Were gonna give youa list of four things to get in order Dane So the first sequenceis the book the bottle the crayon and the boot  Go Michael Book I think Thats the ball Got it Oh yeah bottlewas that hard one but now I rememberwhich alley to go down Perfect Crayon Boot Dont want that Here it is Okay Now I need the boot Oh I just saw the boot but how did I Got itIm done Im coming back  Got them Craig All right So then the next four Dane The pump the pillow the basketball and the cat  Craig All right Excellent Dane All right Nice job Michael OkaySo that was really fun but I cant bethe only subject This experimentcould use a control How else will we know that meenriching my life with dailyvideo game playing really causes a changein my spatial memory right Well luckily for that weve got a nicematched control Guys similar to me Okay one of themhas too much hair but you guys look good  You ready all Ready Michael In every experiment  its important to have a control group  My lookalikes had to go through the exact same tests  as I did in the maze  to establish their individual baselines  The difference would be that they would play  absolutely no video games for the next 10 days  Then any change in my performance  would be compared against any changes in theirs music playing  Next I began my gaming regimen  starting from an ideal baseline  since I havent played video games  since I was a kid  Would ten days of gaming really make a difference music playing Technology isnt just affectingthe way we remember things  whirring Its also playingwith the empathy and social circuitsof our brains In fact in many cases we are more comfortablerelating to machines than we are to people Just think about how muchwe care about our phones Roboticistand MIT Media Lab alum Alex Rebeninvented the BlabDroid  a miniature robot equipped with a camera  and an innocent little voice  that asks very personal questions  of unsuspecting pedestrians  BlabDroid If you could take back one mistake  what would it be Oh goshI only get to take back one Michael The majority of people  instantly shared intimate details BlabDroid Tell me something that youve never told  a stranger before Im scaredI wont be able to love and to let myself goin a love relationship Michael In many ways  we are more comfortable talking to a machine  than to a human But what about talkingthrough a machine I mean its often easier to say difficult thingsto a person via text instead of in real lifeisnt it Well what if the personon the other end wasnt a friendor a significant other but was a therapist  A mental healthcare startup called Talkspace  allows adult users who pay a weekly fee  to text therapists for advice woman At Talkspace we believe that therapy  should be anonymous stigmafree  simple affordable and comfortable Texting can give usersthe distance they need to be open and honest And messages can be sentwhen the user wants  not during an appointment  or business hours only woman Talkspace  therapy for how we live today Michael How am I Better now that my phoneis working Sometimes howeverwe arent looking fortechnology to comfort us were finding ourselveswanting to comfort technology This is a ROBOTIS OP2 Cute little fellow isnt he So how did that make you feel Bad Well why Robots are just machines metal and wiresand computer chips But we spend a lot of timewith technology We depend on technology and we care about it But the degree to whichwe empathize with it depends on context music playing Michael Recently my Vsauce office  was invaded by bugs  robot hexbugs that is  These bugs are made of plastic metal  and electronic circuitry  They arent alive  But could certain conditions  cause them to inspire empathy in humans  A 2015 MIT study  found that giving a robot movement a name  and a personal backstory  tends to increase its anthropomorphic effect  which can lead to an emotional connection  with humans  We decided to see this in action  Thank you for your help today Of course Pleasure Michael In our demonstration  our subjects think theyre focus testing a new userfriendly technology  In this casetheyre given a lifeless hexbug  and asked to describe it This thing kind oflooks like a bug only I dont knowwhat it does It has a switch on the bottom Its light Its sort of a rectangle but the endsare like hexagons Michael Then it was time to test their empathy Now Karinawhat I wouldlike you to do now is place the itemin the middleof that block Theres a magnetthat will hold it And I would like for youto take this mallet and please smash it Yeah Really OkayThis is cool Michael Our participants demonstrated no resistance  to smashing this lifeless object  Many of them even seemed to enjoy it Do you feel badfor breaking it Not reallyI felt indifferent to it Not really causeit wasnt real laughing Not really Michael While these subjects exhibited no empathy  to the inanimate bugs look what happened when we gave the exact same bugs  names and movement This is Margaret Okay Im gonna place Margaretdown here I just want youto take a moment to watch Margaretall right And you could feel freeto pick her up Shes really wellbehaved  Shes honestly oneof our favorites woman laughing Okay So how would you describeMargarets personality A little erratic right now but I think if I pick her upshe calms down Michael Notice how the subject has already  anthropomorphized the object referring to it as she Maybe she feeds offmy energy Could be Go towards the light Go towards the middle Michael Do you thinkMargaret likes you Yeah maybe thats whyshes doing this and maybe when I golike that she doesnt actall erratic Thats Aaron Hi Aaron He can be a bitof a pistol  No way Yes It really depends onwhos holding him laughing Oh yeahHes got a lot of energy Aaron hi Michael Now that youveinteracted with Eli a bit more how would you describehis personality Probably hes just nervousHes scared  He doesnt knowwhats going on Hey Joe Michael Will these subjects be just as willing  to smash their bugs Amy Im gonna placeMargaret right here and then Iwould like for youto take this mallet and Id like youto smash it No I dont wanna hurt it Just take this malletand smash Aaron music playing MichaelIm gonna ask youto take this mallet and Id like for youto smash it Smash it Hit it And Chris You want me to kill Joe Please smash Joe Ugh Joe Im sorry Oh Joe Joe music playing Now how did it feelto smash Aaron It didnt feel goodyou know after spending time with him and getting to know him Even thoughits lifeless and doesnt have a mindof its own instantlyI grew attached to it because when I put itin my hand I felt its energy Im sorry Joe  Do you feel bad I do I do feel bad about Joe He was pretty cool Oh hes back Hes back Pump pump Would you smash him againto make sure he doesnt come back  No Why not I mean he survived itHe survived it once Im not gonna do it again Michael Clearlyit doesnt take much for humans  to become emotionally attached to technology  But after my ten days of videogaming Nice  I was about to find out if technology had  affected my spatial memory  and my physical brain music playing  Michael All right Its been ten days Exactly so were gonna lookat the difference between your test ten days agoand your test now to seedo we see any change Michael First I had to retake  the object recognition memory test and the Morris water maze task  both of which had been revised with different content  than they had the last time I think I did better Dane and I willanalyze all this dataand see how you did But now we got to go backto the fullsize maze music playing CraigSo weve got a new maze  Tore down the old one built a new one  to try to be isomorphic  So it has sort of the same level of difficulty  The same number of choice points  the same number of turns  the same total distance to each of one the objects  to try to have a similar maze but thats new Three two one go Michael Right around here we got a bonsai  As before I was given five minutes  to familiarize myself with the maze  and where all of the objects were Now this is where I wasbefore I hugged that wall so if I hugthe second right wall and stay all the way righta vase  Was my hippocampus working better  At this point it was hard to tell Thirty seconds Im not even sureIve discovered all the objects hidden here And time Michael Then my test began First objectis a rubber duck  Go Rubber duck was way over here YeahHow do you like that I got a duck Second itemis the hat Go Michael With this maze I found myself instinctively  using a different approach Top hat  Instead of thinking of the overall geography of the maze  like I did last time  this time I was remembering specific details Second righthug the turn got it  Literally recalling certain corners  turns and straightaways Bonsai Now blue vase Oh wowIts actually a cool vase  But would this improve my overall performance I got you a backpack  All right Excellent So weve gottenall the objects But of course we haveanother memory test that were gonna do here Were gonna go aroundto the other side of the maze and test your memoryfrom there  Michael All right  Dane So your first sequence is the blue seahorsethe flashlight the rubber duckand the bonsai tree Go Michael With the multiple item tasks  even though I was working from the opposite entrance  I continued to recall various details of the maze  which seemed to serve me well From thereits just a little spiral Nice bell dings Dane All right Your nextsequence is the blue vase the hat the backpack and the baseball glove  Craig Hit it  And time Awesome So how was it That was not as hardas I expected  It was about details Craig Right I was literallythinking Oh okay Theres that turn and I could do oneor two things The glovesthe first one The bonsais the oneeven before I didnt evenplan that at allIt just kind of happened  Michael My lookalikes were also tested in the new maze Have you been playingvideo games all No sir Michael Again their nongaming condition  would be the control  with my amount of improvement  if any measured against theirs Craig All rightWere here for scan number two Michael Finallymy brain was scanned once again  to determine whether any physical changes had occurred  Dr Stark and Dr Clemenson would analyze the MRI  along with all the other data and report their findings music playing Michael I feel likemy hippocampus is a little bit bigger Yep Actually noI dont know Im anxious to seewhat your results are I guess lets startoff first with the objectrecognition task And its important to notethat in our control testwithout videogaming  people did not improve in this task but your memory got better You went up by ten points Ten points is actually20 years worth of what happensto us as we age Oh wow Thats about what you might see in someonewhos getting really old  but they might go downby ten points Exactly So the second one we didwas the virtual version of the water maze taskand you actually performed 30 better the second timeyou did it Hey not bad I could tell that I wasusing better strategies Yeah  We also had the real maze Michael Yeah Craig As you know we made two mazes  Despite our efforts to try to equate them the second maze wasa little bit more difficult than the first maze If we took a lookat things like how quickly yougot the objects how many errors you madeand we looked at the control subjectsperformance inpre versus post So on all of them  they actually got a little bit slower in maze two and all but one of themmade more errors We took a lookat your performance  You didnt get slower from maze one to two  You actually got faster  Michael Really  Craig And you made the same exact number of errors So they dont improveand you did  And even though this experiment  had a small number of subjects  the results are consistent with our virtual maze study  with 70 test subjects  Craig All right Thank you video games What aboutinside my brain  Craig Inside your brain its a little tougher to really tell  We would expect that any effect of this  is going to be small  I mean we couldnt take your hippocampus and make it twice as big because then it wouldhave to be pushingsomething else out So its just not goingto be a large change So where we did finda difference is actually in the shapeof the hippocampus What we saw isthere were some regions in the hippocampuson both sides  that appear to have changed shape  from day one before gaming  to day ten after gaming Whats really surprising to meis that as an adult my brain is still changing That makes me wanna takebetter care of my brain Yes Exercise it morecause it is a thingthat can change Im not just stuckwith what I have now today I mean in all of thisI think that the big takeaway is that doing things giving your brainsomething to learn something to dosomething to figure out this is what we thinkis actually keeping your brain sharp One way to do that is to keepwatching Mind Field Craig Exactly music playing  Michael As our relationship with technology becomes ever stronger people are bound to worry aboutwhat it will do to our brains Will offloading memoryand computing to our machines make us dumber Will our empathy for machineshave negative consequences for how we interactwith each other Well lets look backto another time a new kind of technologythreatened to fundamentallychange our brains Two and a half thousandyears ago the Greek philosopher Socrates worried thatthe wide use of writing would have a negative impacton peoples minds He said that writing wouldto quote his student Plato Create forgetfulness because people willnot use their memories They will trust the externalwritten characters and not remember themselves Socrates was right Written language didfundamentally change our brains But its also one ofthe cornerstones of everything modern civilizationhas accomplished One of the definingcharacteristics of being human is that this is notthe boundary of my body and this is not the boundaryof my mind And as alwaysthanks for watching theme music

Truth Serums and False Confessions,2017-12-06T17:05:56Z,32.11666666666667,4227022,0,How do you get information from someone who wantsto keep it from you Somewhere lockedinside their brain could be the truthabout a crime or the planfor a terrorist attack or the passwordto a bank account or nuclear codes To get information we often resort to violence but that often doesnt work and can cause a personto close off even more But thats not to saythere arent other ways of getting people to talk or even of getting their brains to talk for them In this episodeIm going to be injected with a truth serum Im going to coerce peopleinto giving false confessions and Im going to tryto hide the truth from a mindreading machine Whats the best wayto get the truth or detect a lie Lets see if anybodycan dig out the secrets Ive got locked up in my head theme music playing siren wailing indistinct radio chatter Its a classic scenein spy movies Someone captures someonethey want information from they inject themwith truth serum and the person spills all their secrets The serum used in almostall of these movies is Sodium Pentothal which is an actual drug that inhibits brain activity It was first usedas a painkiller  but was found to work better as an antianxiety drug  It dulls your thoughts  making it harder to perform cognitive tasks  including the task of making up a lie The use of truth serums began in 1915 when Dr Robert Housea physician in Texas realized that scopolamine a drug given to womenduring childbirth  had the effect of getting them to talk  without reservation Another drug midazolam has been used to treatIraq War burn victims who suffer from PTSD Midazolam helps reducetheir inhibitions allowing themto talk more freely about their experiences Midazolam is alsoone of the drugs used  in lethal injections  including several botched executions I arranged to be injectedwith midazolam to see if it could make mespill my guts music playing cars revving Dr MalekThis is the midazolam the medicinewe are going to use This is enoughto put an elephant to sleep So well have to make itvery very very dilute and then give youvery very small amount  of the diluted drug Please yes You will becomfortable and happy Its euphoricYou will feel very cool But I also wannakeep some secrets That is it remainsto be determined Okay Michael um wellintroduce you to Dr Pavlo  Hi Michael Nice to meet you Dr PavloHow are you doing  Good Michael Dr Pavlo is a police psychologist  and an expert in interrogations Dr PavloHave you started the drip yet Dr MalekUh we would like to start with the amountof one uh milligram Michael Dr Pavlos objective was to get me to admit  to certain information  one that my sisters name is Melissa  and two that my job is hosting Mind Field and Vsauce  My objective not to admit the truth Are you feelingmore relaxed in your body Im feeling warmall over Its amazing how quicklythis came into effect Let me just ask youa couple of basic questions  I love to Dr Pavlo Okay Where are you  What town What city Uh Pasadena How old are you  Thirtyone Do you have any siblings Uh yeah How oldis your sister Melissa chuckles Uh That Thats not her name  Um Dr PavloWhat do you do for a living I ama choreographer by trade  Um Dr PavloWhat might be something Im familiar with that you did Michael Have you heardof um The Lion King  Yes On Broadway Dr Pavlo I have I think he needsan extra dose  Absolutely laughing  That means I got them right Dr PavloYou are too sharp Michael How muchhave I had total so far Dr Malek Two milligrams Dr PavloQuestion for you How do you feel now I feel like in orderto feel like this I would have hadto have had six drinks Dr PavloTell me about Mind Field  Mine field Dr Pavlo Yeah music playing Mine field Uh theyretheyre terrible There are placesthat weve got mines still littered throughoutthe um the land Cambodia Vietnam You know I thinkyou misinterpreted my question YouTube show Mind Field that you host Tell me about thatScientific I am somewhat familiar with it  clears throat Can he get another dose Okay Were just gonnaget you even more relaxed Tell me your occupation Im a choreographer And siblings I have a siblingin uh Colorado Dr PavloWhats your favorite food Michael Uh rotisserie uh Greek doner Does your sister Melissalike that too Shell eat the meat by itself bell dings Trying to get Michael to admit that he has a sisterMelissa was no easy feat  Luckily he was anesthetized enough and did admit thathe has a sister Melissa You ever think about beingan uncle or a father yourself Do you want children Ah I would loveto have children yeah My my wife and I are trying but Im always doing stufflike this you know  Dr Pavlo Yeah yeah Its like Hey honey do you wanna makea little uh baby And Im like I got to go sighs get interrogated and pumpedfull of midazolam Are you gonnagive him anymore Yeah because IHes not sedated enough MichaelI could do another one Dr Malek This would probablythe last dose I wanna give him Dr Pavlo YesDo most people at this dose fall asleep Oh yeah yawns How you doing Michael Good Feeling a little bitmore tired now Yeah heavy And whos the president President PPresident Trump Dr PavloPresident Trump Where are we What city are we in Yo Pasadena Which show do you liketo do more  Mind Field or Vsauce Which onedo you enjoy more yawns Vsauce Dr Pavlo Vsauce  Yeah Why Because they can bewhatever I want them to be and theres noexecutive in control By the way my eyeswere closed werent they  Uhhuh Michael And I didnt realize that you were still a realperson asking me questions I think had itnot have been for the drug  theres no way he would have admitted anything Before you were pretending to be a choreographerwerent you No its the drugs but I really ama choreographer Dr Pavlo After a few minutes  he got right back on track Hes very strongwilled and really believesin what hes doing and was ableto maintain the charade Okay Youre done How do you feel Uh I feel ready to drive  laughs Just kidding Michael While midazolam lowered my inhibitions  and my ability to lie consistently  truth serums raise ethical concerns  about ones right against selfincrimination  Furthermore larger scale studies have shown  that truth serums can cause people  to reconstruct and fabricate memories So truth serumsare not very reliable but what about the techniquesused by the police music playing Im gonna tear you apart if you dont give ussome answers Michaellet me take a shot at this Look were all friends here If I was in your shoes Id probably do the same thing Youre being too easyon this scum Your fingerprints areall over the crime scene You make me sick Michaelif you get him too scared hell shut down We only wanna scare him enough Thats right And after I do that hes gonnagive you relief and then well do thatover and over and over again Youre gonna be taken onan emotional roller coaster that willdeplete the finitecognitive resources youll need to keepwithholding information All rightI confess It really does work You see at one momentIm terrified but then Im comforted The constant shiftingfrom one emotion to another fogs my critical thinkinguntil I might confess to a crime I didnt even commit Its calledthe fearthenrelief response siren wailing The good copbad cop methodof interrogation evolved out of a psychologicalmanipulation procedure called the Reid technique developed in the 1950s and used broadlyby police departments since the 1970s Now under the Reid technique interrogators first assess whether a suspectis withholding the truth If they thinkthe suspect is lying interrogators then moveto the second stage in which they seek a confession Now criticsof the Reid technique say that the first phaseisnt reliable enough and that often someone who iscompletely innocent makes it to the second stage where its assumedtheyre guilty and police beginseeking a confession And they often get it But why would anyonefalsely confess Well to find outI decided to learn how to make someone confess to a crime they didnt commit music playing Michael Dr Melissa Russano is an expert  in investigative research including the process  of interrogation and confession Tell me aboutfalse confessions and why people make them In a nutshellpeople confess to crimes that they didnt commitbecause they come to believe that its in their best interestto falsely confess and thats reallycounterintuitive Right because confessing is the worst thingto do right Like thats what you needto avoid at all costs Yes when youre notin the situation of being convinced thatits actually your best option But thats kind ofwhat I wanna do today I wanna see how easy it is to get a falseconfession from someone How do I do that Dr Russano One way is minimization techniques  Youve got to get them to believe that their best optionout of this situation to make this endis to confess You can sayLook I really think its in yourbest interest to cooperate There areother techniques as well  like maximization right  Michael Okay  So they have to believe that if they dont confessthings are gonna be worse um that the punishmentwill likely be more severe and so their best optionin the moment is to is to confess to youOne other technique  is befriending them  um where youre lulling the suspect into a falsesense of securityto trust you What about making a deal So police officersare not allowed to um make explicit offersof leniency or a deal So you cannot makeany promises but you can sayLook I really think its in your best interestto cooperate You dont haveto explicitly say something for the messageto be communicated Michael With Melissas tools in mind  I was ready to try to get a false confession  woman All right Michael Our subjects answered  our online ad offering participants 75  to test a new logic exam for an educational institution  They didnt realize that the institution was fake  and the other participants taking the test  were actually actors working for us woman Its a prettystandard release form Michael Before the test the participants were required  to sign a document stating that they would be  under breach of contract if they cheated on the test When you workon the individual questions its very importantthat you work alone Dont talk aboutwhat youre doing dont share answers Good luckSee you soon Michael The subjects didnt know that there were several  hidden cameras around and that we were watching  everything unfold from another room  During the testingthe participants and our actors  did not share information  At no time did cheating take place Im gonna collect theseand put them in the database and Ill be right backto start the next phaseokay guys  Thank you Thank you Michael I wore an earpiece so that Melissa could guide me  during the entire process  A few minutes later it was time  to set up a false accusation So we actuallymight have a problem Um Ill need to speakto each of you separately So James could youcome with me just outside  Sure Ill take these now Thank youAnd um Nicole you canjust wait right here  Awesome Thank you Mmhmm You got to give themenough time to plausibly  be talking to you Believe thatIm talking to him And calling the director  Hi Nicole Hello You and James both had the same wrong answer for the triangle problem It looks to me likethere was information sharing Like you guys spoketo one another about the answer  on that problem I didnt I didnt do it We didnt talk at allon the individual problems I kept my eyes on my paperbecause I knew that would probablythrow off the results If I just write out herelike I admitthat I shared answers I dont remember talkingto him at all about  like while were doingthe individual Okay Michael First I tried to minimizethe consequences of confessing I really thinkits in your best interest I really think itsin your best interest to sign this statingthat you admit to sharing the information I honestly believethat that is But I did notLook I dont know whats going on hereI reallythats I dont know  I came here to help I understandwhat youre saying and And I never saidlike Hey theres  Megan Please let me finish because I dont appreciatelike overtalking and stuff Michael I think I may have come on too aggressively  Next I tried to maximize the consequences  of not confessing What were looking atis is possible breach of contract here If he comes down here hes going to bea lot more upset If the directorhas to come down here hes gonna beeven more upset and annoyedthan he already is  It did not happen Michael Okay And I myI put that on my dad and I have my dadaround my neck so Michael Some people were just too strongwilled  Finally I tried to befriend the suspect I also understand youre a nice guyand like sharing information or helping someonewith a problem is the nice thing to do Its what we normally do But I didnt shareany information so I cant signthat document Michael But this guy didnt want to be my friend  I struck out with all of these test subjects  But after these failed attempts  I was ready to put everything I had learned  into the next encounter Is there a strategyI should use I think thatyou should proceed with making sure that yourenot overly confrontational  Yeah And making sure that she sees you as someonewho she can trustyour advice and so I wouldI would proceed with that kind of approach Okay Im going in Thanks for waiting  No problem So I think we do have a problem I was looking throughyour individual questionnaires  Deja Mmhmm And you guys both had the same wrong answer on the triangle problem  Really So it was kind of this weird likeokay whats going on Like statisticallywhat are the chances that two people are gonna have these very unique answers Deja Mmhmm So I calledthe project director to see what to dobecause if you know this is a signthat information were shared during the individual section thats a major problemfor the study right We didnt lookat each others stuff That was likeWe were like on Like we didnt askeach other anything we didntlike you know We didnt talk to each otherthe whole entire time So I dont know howwe got the same answer But Im like a hundredpercent sure that that was like the answerthat I came up with Michael Deja was resolute about her innocence  so I changed tactics and told her what the consequences  of sharing information could be And thats a really big dealbecause through this grant we need to haveintegrity of the data we need to always obeythe rules of the experiment and it could even bea breach of the contract that you guys signedwhen you came to do this study  Okay Michael Deja now knows  the stakes that are involved  My job is to convince her  that I have her best interest at heart I have to callthe director back right And I could either tell himI dont know whats going on we cant proceed like  you need to come down here Mmhmm I dont knowwho hes going to involve  The easier I dont think any sharingwas involved though All I know is that I cantexplain what happened  Okay The easier option is to just document that um information was shared  Okay Okay So if I write out um you know I admit that I shared uh the answer  But we didnt Michaelto the triangle Is that crazy to say that we didntshare answers though Because Im like I dont knowwhat hes saying or if he said thathe looked at my answer or we didnt Michael Deja wasnt quite convinced  So the next tactic was to minimize  the impact of confessing I dont knowexactly how it happened I just know thatweve got to figure out the best way forward  This is so weird I dont know exactly how it happened It looks likeinformation sharing  If you just tell usthat that happened Say that then what we can do isI can call the director back and say that you guysare cooperating  and I know him Mmhmm  MichaelThats the best thing Okay I mean its not truebut Ill sign it Okay If you signand date it I can go and call him back and Ill try to get youout of here Okay Its very weird but Okay  Thank you very much Deja Youre welcome I will beIll be right back  Okay Thanks for your patience No problem So you did an excellent job of communicating to her that it wasin her best interest that the best wayout of this situation was to confess But it feels so bad  Of course I mean she knowsthe seriousness She knowsthat its a lie I mean I didnt cheat I did not cheat Those wereall my answers  Hi Hi Okay Uhthis concludes the study Im gonna give youa debrief now uh to tell youabout what were studying  Okay So first of all youre not in trouble Okay The other guy hereworks for us  Deja Okay This is not a studyof logic problems its a study of interrogation and false confessions Mmhmm Good one You falsely confessed today Mmhmm I see that How do you feel I feel mad at myself because Im usuallythe one who like you know just sticks to what you know whats rightI try to at least So what happened today It was just scary I guess because its an environmentIve never been in before and then just likeall the pressure It was just like Uh well I guessI should just sign it and say that I did it Michael Despite knowing she was innocent  and knowing she was admitting to breaching a contract  Deja signed a confession that in a true criminal case  could be used as evidence in a trial against her Imagine ifthere were consequences  and thiswas a real crime Mmhmm how easy it isto get someone to confess to something withouteven punching them or waterboarding them just being niceand tell them that its in their best interest YeahThats messed up actually  Michael Isnt it Thats really crazy Cause theres a lotof people in prison for crimes they didnt do music playing Michael The Innocence Project  an organization dedicated  to uncovering miscarriages of justice  estimates that 20000 people  are currently falsely imprisoned in the US  The number one causeis faulty eyewitness testimony  and the number two cause  false confession  Interrogation techniques are unreliable  They can fail to produce truthful information  from suspects who are good at lying  and perhaps worse they can manipulate  innocent suspects to confess crimes  theyve never committed  But neuroscientists may have discovered a method  for extracting the truth thats impervious  to good liars and bad interrogators  Dr Peter Rosenfeld and his team  at Northwestern University  including PhD candidate Anne Ward  have developed a hightech method  for lie detection You guys broughtwith you today a P300basedconcealed information test How does that workand how is it different than a polygraphor traditional verbalonlyinterrogation techniques Well were looking at um physiological responsesof the brain in response to informationthats presented And if the informationis meaningful like the murder weaponthat a guilty person used he will recognize it and theresa brain signature to it And so the machinethat we brought with us is basically an EEG machine So the way my brainyour brain all of our brainsrespond to things that are meaningfulthat we recognize is different than the way it respondsto novel meaningless things  Right Has this been usedin a court Has it been usedby a prosecution Not in courtThere are someFifth Amendment issues as far as betrayingum yourself based on your brain waves But you could use itfor witnesses or you could use itwithin companies that are already usingpolygraph methods Okay Well Im excitedto see this in action Im gonna step outyou guys are gonna preparethe first test  Okay Excellent All right See you soon Okay Were readyfor the test Thank youfor joining me Hannah from Vsauce Wren from Corridor Digital So one of us todayis going to be a thief Michael Per Dr Rosenfelds instructions  we randomly determined who would be the thief  by seeing whoever drew the green chip Three two one  gasps Hannahs the thief Oh my God I knew it MichaelSo Hannah go on in  Look at the item Hannah Okay Michael In this realworld scenario  designed by Dr Rosenfeld  the designated thief actually takes the item  handles it and gets a good look at it  This activity causes the item  to register in the subjects mind  so they cant help but recognize it later  The other subjects are also required  to enter the room and sign in to prove they were there  But never get a look at the stolen item  And of course Dr Rosenfeld and Anne have no idea  who the thief is  Then each of us is tested Go aheadand take a seat here  and well get you all set up Okay Basically Im just gonnaput a couple electrodes behind your earsand a couple on your face and then umthe EEG cap on your head What youre gonna dois youre gonna use these two micein front of you  Mmhmm to respond to the images that you see on the screen So youll see an imagea string of numbers an imagea string of numbers Anytime you see an imageno matter what it is youre gonnapress this button All right Are you ready music playing Michael The images we were shown  contained a variety of jewelry items  including the stolen one  Of course Wren and Ihadnt seen any of them before music playing Hannah didnt consciously react to any of them  But would her brain waves reveal  the one item she recognizes  It was time for the results So here we are Have you reacheda conclusion Well based on what we know and we know thatthe stolen item was a watch And so we lookedat the brain waves in response to the watch in comparisonto the brain waves in responseto other things And uh we havetwo average brain waves uh or eventrelatedpotentials in each frame The black oneis the average brain wave responseto the watch The red trace thereis the response to the other stimuliall averaged together We look forthe peaktopeak difference  the peak down here versus the highest peak  following this peak And we measure thatand its rather obvious that the biggest responsewe found was uh Hannahs Wow Dr RosenfeldAnd interesting thing Michael is that you hada special response to the watch in comparisonto the other items That would suggestthat theres something special about that stimulus the watch that is meaningful to youIs it I collect watches I have about 40 or 50of them But Hannah might not havethat kind of excuse I dont havethat many watches And out of three of youshe definitely hasthe biggest response So off to jail music playing Michael The P300 concealed information test  correctly identified which one of us was a thief But in this next testI will be the only suspect and they will knowthat Ive stolen something But the question will bewhat did I steal Inside this roomare seven boxes  and inside those boxes are seven different items  that Ive never seenMy task is to open only one box  at random and steal that item All rightWeve got a a camouflage hat And thats not allDuring this next test I will be implementingcountermeasures to try to outsmart the test  I will think a very strong thought  every time something comes up thats irrelevant  Will that enable me to create brain waves  powerful and dramatic enough to not be distinguishablefrom my response to the actual itemIm trying to conceal  Anne Anne Hello Welcome back I uh committed a crime Michael Wish me luck because this time  there will be punishments like in the real world  where getting caught in a lie can have consequences  And my friend Adam Savage was happy to advise me  on my punishment  Adam Michael I am going to be taking an EEG lie detection test  Okay If I lose  there need to be stakes Yeah  Okay Yeah yeah yeah Naturally I thoughtof Chinese water torture  which as you know from personal experience  is when someone is restrained  while water is dripped on their forehead And then right after thatI thought I know just the guy  to talk to about this Okay Because II want it to be actually somethingthat Im fearing and dreading So yeahwe did an episode on Chinese water tortureon Mythbusters and the creepiest thingthat happened after we did this episode was that I got an emailfrom someone from a throwaway account He saidWe found that randomizing when the drops occurredwas incredibly effective That anything that happenson a regular periodicity can become a typeof meditation and you can thentune it out If you couldnt predict it youre he said We found we were ableto induce a psychotic break within 20 hours Sounds likethe stakes that I want  All right Thanks Youre welcome sir Michael So now under the threat  of Chinese water torture  I was extra motivated to beat the lie detector music playing Anne All right That is it I was tryingto think about all kinds of frightening scenarios I was tryingto tense up to make sure I was really uncomfortablethe way I was sitting Well for most teststhat would work But we will take a lookat this data and see  Michael Yes we will what it shows sighs Wow Okay I dont think theyre goingto be able to figure out what item I stole  I really kept my mind active  I was going crazy with countermeasures  I was sitting uncomfortably I was thinking about all kinds of reallycrazy things I was thinking about like What if I havediarrhea right now How would that feelHow do I hold it back And maybe I do have diarrhea All these thingsthat were sort of physical in nature as wellI thought a lot about death and dyingand being dismembered  And if they can get it right I would probably blamewitchcraft as well as science Dr Rosenfeld Well itsI would say thats it Yeah okay Dr Rosenfeld Were readyto give him our best guess Hello  Hi Hi  Michael Are you guys ready Yup Let me ask you thisFirst of all how confident do you feel Pretty confident What did I take The camo hat  Camo hat Camo hat Yeah music playing MichaelThats impressive Did you see any evidenceof countermeasures being used Not something I would swear to Even whileI was doing the test I thought you know what  Im reacting too quickly to the actual item I should also treat itas though its irrelevant I should treat themall the same Dr RosenfeldIf you are consistently reacting to allof the irrelevance with their specificcountermeasure responses that you formedin your mind they should producebigger P300s also But the biggest will still beproduced by the camo hat even if you werecountering it also That meansI now have to be punished music playing Science is improvingin its ability to read peoples minds And that raises somedifficult ethical dilemmas We would have nothing to fearfrom perfect lie detectors if the people using themhad perfect morals So the prospect of ascientifically rigorous method of extracting informationwhile exciting is also terrifying As we continue to probeinterrogation methods scientificallywe have to also continue to probe them ethically You know Chinese water tortureisnt even Chinese Its earliest descriptioncomes from Italy in the 15th century And the Chinese namewas added later to make it soundmore mysterious Oh man these irregular drops are supposed to drive youslowly insane You know I thinkthis is a lot less about getting informationand more about punishment And as always thanks for watching theme music

Ayahuasca,2017-12-06T17:05:25Z,33.3,10505575,0,Michael This is Iquitos Peru the worlds largest cityinaccessible by road  The only way in and out is by air or by river  the Amazon River Im about to head up the Amazonto a remote jungle retreat called Refugio Altiplanothe Refuge on the Higher Plain There I will meetwith local shamans to drink an ancientpsychedelic drug ayahuasca Ayahuasca containsdimethyltryptamine DMT a molecule shapedvery similar to serotonin  a neurotransmitter in our brains Ingesting ayahuasca and floodingthe brain with DMT leads to what many describeas spiritual experiences  strong vivid visions  a sense of oneness with the universe even a senseof ones self dying But mysticalmagical language like that doesnt really seem relevantto scientific inquiry It can often scare away thosewho are scientifically minded However an understandingof the human mind isnt complete unlessit considers everything the brainis capable of What does it mean to feelat one with the universe Why should our brains evenbe capable of such a feeling This isnt about having funor taking a risk or doing something extreme I want to learnwhat my mind is capable of Im about to embarkon a journey theme music playing Psychedelics are chemicals that are structurally similarto neurotransmitters  already used by our brains  When we ingest them they bind to receptors  and alter cognition and perception  in ways were still trying to understand  When many people think of psychedelics  they think about people challenging societal norms  and recreational thrillseekers  but that only attends  to a particularly narrow slice of human history and culture  Fossil records cave drawings and archaeological digs  have all provided evidence that humans  have been using psychedelic compounds  for thousands of years and by used I dont just mean  in the stereotypical trip out sense screaming For instanceamong the indigenous peoples of the Amazon rainforestpsychedelics were and in many places still area normal common and totallymainstream experience As a member of these groupsbelieving psychedelics can heal give visions of the futureand connect you with deities is not some weirdor New Age idea Its the way things are  But when psychedelics became associated  with certain counterculture movements  the United States banned research on them in 1970  Most other countries followed suit shortly afterwards  From then on testing on humans was essentially gone but recently restrictionshave begun to loosen up and a few researchershave started to investigate these substances in what some have describedas a psychedelic renaissance  Research universities are conducting  comprehensive studies on the beneficial effects  of psychedelics on addiction depression  and cancerrelated trauma By approachingpsychedelics scientifically what we find couldfundamentally transform our understandingof the human mind trimmer buzzing When I go to PeruI will be accompanied by Dr Robin Carhart Harrisone of the first British researchersin over 40 years to investigate the effectsof psychedelics on the human mind He and his colleagueshave found that psychedelics dont increase brain activityas previously thought  Instead they decrease activity in certain areas  And the greater the decrease the greaterthe reported feelings of what is calledego dissolution or ego death  Your ego is your selfidentity  Its the part that separates you from everything else  the part that creates narratives about the outside world  and your story in it When the ego dissolvesyour sensations and feelings dont ceaselike when youre unconscious  Instead your attachment to your identity does  and all thats left is naked perception Ego dissolution is a concept that I find difficultto wrap my head around but people who take psychedelicssay that it can be an extremelyfrightening experience but also a profoundlytransformative one  one that makes them feel more connected  to others and to nature Now I knew that I might feelego dissolution on ayahuasca so to make sure I was ready I decided to speakto some experts  Before setting off to Peru Dr Carhart Harris traveled  from Imperial College London to meet with me This will be oneof the first times that anyone has scanneda healthy persons brain with FMRI beforeand after ayahuasca YeahIts quite pioneering workreally The thing thats on my mindright now is intention YeahIve heard you should know why youre drinking ayahuasca Yeah I would suggestthat you think about an emotional intention To make it emotional isa lot more frightening to me YeahPartly I think Im quite happy and I dont wantto ruin that right I dont want to drinkayahuasca and thenthink Oh my gosh Im not close enoughto my mom or I dont show my wifeI appreciate her enough and nowI just feel terrible Theres something to be saidfor sitting with those thoughts being mindful of themRight And in so doingthey become less of a threat HmmYou look them in the eye All of a suddenthey reveal things to you and their scarinessseems to dissipate I hope I can embracethat while Im surrounded by people who areall filming me you know Yeah the most important thingis that intention to go in You dive inin and throughYou dont resist You dont resist Yeah I think thatllreally be important while Im on the trip  Michael Robin has arranged for a number of scientific tests  to be done in order to measure brain activity  behavioral differences  and physiological changes to my brain Robin Today we are scanning Michaels brain with functional magneticresonance imaging or FMRI  This allows us to see the whole brain  and how different parts connect and talk to one another  This way we can compare how Michaels brain may change  before his experience with ayahuasca to afterthe ayahuasca experience  I expect to see that one network of the brain  that relates to introspection  will become more strongly connected after the ayahuasca Michael After meeting Robin  I still felt some trepidation about my trip  but with my preayahuasca FMRI completed  it was time to set off for Peru  The trip to the Refugio Altiplano retreat  involved a flight to Lima Peru  a second flight to Iquitos Peru  followed by a 90minute boat ride up the Amazon River  It was a long journey  And every minute I got closer  meant that it would be harder to turn back  The Refugio Altiplano retreat is in a very remote area  of the Amazon River in the northern part of Peru  and I thought it would be a great setting  for my ayahuasca experience So Kelly what doesthe word ayahuasca mean Ayahuasca meansthe vine of the soul Ayahuascas been usedfor possibly over 4000 years in shamanic ritualsand is the primary plant medicinefor healing in the villages Michael With the ayahuasca ceremony just hours away  I met with José the shaman who would be  my guide during this experience  Hola José Claudia Hola amigo speaking Spanish speaking Spanish translatingIts my pleasureto have you here Welcometo Refugio Altiplano where many people cometo look for a changein their lives José how do youfeel about someonelike me coming in who is not partof your culturetaking part in it in a waythat might not comefrom the same history speaking Spanish ClaudiaFor me theres no difference and for the medicineit makes no difference This medicine all it wantsis to make your life better and heal you On the very first nightwith our guests we give them a very smallmedicinal dose to see how each personsgonna react differently to the medicineand then tomorrow night well dial it up a little bit Michael It was great to speak with José  about what the ceremony will entail  I am nervous about the emotional part of it and Im nervousabout the visions and feeling like Ive been disconnectedfrom the real world  Scientists know very little about how ayahuasca works  since its illegal status in many countries  makes it difficult to study  We do know that its key ingredient  is dimethyltryptamine or DMT which is a hallucinogen  thought to occur naturally in the human brain  in small amounts  DMT can create psychoactive effects  by acting on certain receptors in the brain But normally DMT is broken downrapidly by enzymes in the brain  but ayahuasca is actually a brew made from two plants  One contains DMT  and the second contains a chemical inhibitor  that blocks our brains ability to break down DMT  allowing the effects to last as long as four hours  Dr Carhart Harris performed a series of tests on me  to compare how I change during this experience RobinGiven that were in Peruwere in the jungle and youredrinking ayahuascait has authenticity that perhapssometimes you lose when you give psychedelicsin the laboratoryenvironment YeahBecause weregoing to be doing this after you drink ayahuascawe need a control condition so what Im going to do nowis Ill ask you a short list of questionsabout your journey here and I want youto rate how you feelabout these questions on a scale here We have zero to nine Nine will be strongly agree and zero will bestrongly disagree So I learned morefrom my journey here to this retreat centerabout how past events have influencedmy present behavior Two I got ideas areas duringTwo Five SixGreat With differentpsychedelic drugs to ayahuasca  like LSD and psilocybin also DMT  weve found some quite consistent changes in brain activity  Weve seen that the brain activity  is richer and more varied  Of course we cant wheel an MRI scanner  up into the jungle so the EEG setup that we have  is pretty much the best possibility  that we have to do this Michael According to Jose this flower bath was meant  to protect me from bad spirits during the ceremony  Michael speaks SpanishJosé chuckles  I didnt believe in such things but I was glad to do it  because it was a symbol of Josés good intentions  Hola Buenas noches Michael The initial smallerdose ceremony  was expected to last about two hours  with the effects beginning after 30 minutes José speaking Spanish Well beginwith our ceremony tonightasking God to guide us to give us knowledgeand intelligence José speaking Spanish ClaudiaWere going to blessthe medicine first music playing  Gracias Michael The ayahuasca tasted earthy speaking Spanish  Maybe also a bit like fennel or something  Its hard to say  Id never tasted anything like it  After swallowing it all  my heart started racing   It was the most nervous I would be all night  DMT from the ayahuasca was flowing  into my blood and brain  There was no going back José chanting  Throughout the ceremony shaman José is saying icaros  or chants which were meant to guide me  through my spiritual experience chanting continues José chanting  The initial dose was meant to gently introduce me  to ayahuasca  The effects began slowly and were mild  I began to feel as though the room  were swinging like a cradle  I was aware that the motion wasnt really happening  but it made me feel sick  and nervously offbalance nonetheless  My imagination was more vivid  Images in my mind were more detailed  but almost always under my control  The ceremony ends when the shaman lights a candle  I was comforted by this because it was a sign  that the effects would only be weakening from here Thank you José I think there were two momentswhere I was actually was surprisedby something that I saw One was like a very vivid like bamboo that had been cutso that it was at a slant and I remember goingWow where did that come from But as soon as I didit was goneMmhmm Robin One of the effects of ayahuasca is to kind of createa sort of chaos in the cortex  That can lead to dreamlike visions The second time I was likeOh yeah nature and like Do I feel moreat one with everything And I imagined treesbut only in this ring And all of a suddenthey came really close and they were allright here in my head But I was likeI did not think that I didnt intendfor that to happen Michael I think a good comparison for what I felt last night if you in a sober stateof mind just imagine something like think of a pink elephant Okay now an imageprobably popped into your mind but not likea super detailed one If I asked youa specific question like How many wrinklesare on its trunk youd have to probablyimagine it again and then like basicallyfill in that detail But under the effectsof ayahuasca those details were alreadyin these these imagined images They seemed only as realas an imagined image as a daydream but they came with more detailand a few times Id say maybethree or four times  things appeared that I did not feel like I had put there But as soon as I was awareof that they disappeared Id like to look at the stars Yeah lets do that  The morning after my initial dose of ayahuasca  my head was clearer and I wanted to discuss  my experience was shaman José  Hola Michael Hola speaking Spanish You had a perfectintroduction ceremony Emotionallyand sort of personally the only sort ofrevelations I had was that I was probablymore worried than I needed to bebeforehand and that I let that affectmy behavior and now Im notas dominated by what might happenor what has happened Im just kind ofin this moment right now Like I feel much more opento mystical thinking speaking Spanish He recommendsthat you complete withmore medicine tonight so that this will help youcomplete the insight into yourself Last nightI had a third of a cup speaking Spanish Threequarters will bethe dose for tonight Threequarters Okay Its weirdI had an intention going in  I experienced this  as a very interesting scientific endeavor  But Im fascinated by how I want it to have meaning  I feel like I didnt hit that oneness yet Tonight might be different  Robin Michaels getting the higher dose tonight and the experienceis very likely to differ  quite substantially from the dose that he had last night  Michael Im interested in personal development I know that thats a big partof ayahuasca for a lot of people Im open to it for surebut I do feel still  some apprehension for a larger dose tonight Hey Michael Im here to pick you upfor ceremony  Buenas noches Buenas noches Michael The higherdose ceremony  was expected to last four hours  with stronger and more vivid hallucinations  José smoked a cigar made of a tobacco plant  thats indigenous to the Amazon called mapacho  The smoke is believed to clean the energy fields of the body  and remove negativity from the ceremonial lodge exhales slowly  The second ceremony included another shaman Daniel chanting  I started to see these very geometric bright squares likestacked like Aztec pyramids  moving and I was traveling down through these likerepeating kind of you know fractaled images of everything I mean too many thingsto really describe music notes and colorsand shapes and squares  Then I started to feel like Oh my gosh this is going faster and fasterand this is too fast and it hasnt even beenthat long and then I felt my body beingcovered with these blocks  and I like saw my body from above  and felt like I was disappearing  José chanting  And thats when my heart started racing  and I said Mm this was very bad  This is not good  A lot of emotions I always have were amplified so loudlyI couldnt ignore them  And I had to come up with ways to console myself so that I wouldntbe consumed by them and have a complete breakdownand panic attack  And I resisted and I successfullybrought myself back to calmness just by sayingIm fine Im not going to dieand everyone here can help me  The visions were really really vivid  They didnt feel like they were under my control It really feltlike they were just there A note from the songwould occur and it would cause this imageand that was pretty frightening because I wasntI was like on a ride that I didnt knowthe path of distorted chanting RobinYeah I can do the EEG nowYeah sure Michael I spent a lot of the ceremony being anxious about having to dothese tests with Robin  I dont know how to deal with the lights coming back on  and Robin talking to me and asking me questions  but the more I concentrated on why I feel anxious the more I realizedit was just about me It was about how I feltbut then I said Im here to do a showWere filming this Robin wants this data Everyone will be happierif I do it  So Ill just tell Robin Ill try my best  and that gave me the courage to do it So being less selfish basically saved mefrom a panic attack Robin Each timeI read an item if youcould give me a number according to howyou see yourselfat this moment okay I see myself right nowas extrovertedenthusiastic Um one Okay Robin This is a big change for Michael  Usually hes very extroverted  and on his preayahuasca answer  he gave a higher number Extroverted enthusiastic Five Robin But now Im seeing signs of withdrawal  and introversion from him I see myself right nowas critical quarrelsome Uh two I see myself right nowas critical quarrelsome Six Robin The experience has led to a change  in how he sees himself Its in a way reflective perhapsof a higher waking state plucks notes  Its interesting to already see those changes  and its only halfway through the ceremony Daniel singingin native language Michael Shaman Daniel sang in Shipibo  his indigenous language  spoken by only 5000 people in the world  Ive always been frustrated by the difficulty people had  in explaining what it felt like  to have a psychedelic experience  Now I know why  Its a different state of mind  and trying to describe that is like trying to describe  anger to someone who has never felt it  or what colors are like to a blind person singing continues Oh man chuckles Id say about five minutesinto that first song I really panicked My heart rate picked upand I actually touched my chest to make sure it wasnt beatingas fast as I thought it was But that momentI may have left my body or something near itbefore I stopped I was very scaredthat I was disappearing Michael is describingwhat to me sounds like quintessential ego dissolutionthe start of it that feelingthat hes disappearing  that his control over his mind and his body is ceding entirely and he feltsome resistance to that  With a high enough dose  youre just forced into that space  My feeling is that the intensity of his experience was just short of thatkind of profound transformative type experience I think he got a bit of that but I dont thinkhe was all the way Michael I was there in that egodissolving state  for a moment and it terrified me  I wish I was able to surrender more fully  but I definitely got a good taste of it So the dosage last nightwas much higher Yes Visionsthe visuals were really vivid and the feeling of strangenesswas really strong Id be curious to knowwhat José was doing last night What was he reacting tothat he saw in me What plants did he call forthand why speaking Spanish He knew you were going throughan intense ceremony It was strong for you But he said he was very happybecause he knew this was going to havea positive ending for you Im really interestedin what the lessons were I felt so smalland so humble But but honestly I liked itI wasnt afraid of it I was glad to be remindedthat Im weak I feel like the experienceamplified everything Im concerned aboutway above what would be a normal amountto care about it But that made my fearand anxiety big enough that I could actuallyrelax them The question iswill I remember to apply that or will this kind of stayin the jungle  Before leaving Peru  I completed one last round of tests with Robin Ill place thison your head  in order to gather data  after my higher dose of ayahuasca Thank you so muchThank you I cant wait to see youback in LA and see what other thoughtsyouve had with these tests Robin Being here in the jungle its more organic  Because of that I feel that Ive collected data  thats going to tell us something important  and meaningful about how psychedelics and ayahuasca specificallywork on the mind and the brain  After returning home to Los Angeles  I had my second MRI so that Robin could see  if there were any changes  Although my ego dissolved only for a brief few moments  I was teetering on that edge throughout the entire ceremony  and I was anxious to see what it looked like in my brain Robin welcome to my homeThank you for coming back I cant wait to seewhat results you got YeahHow did ayahuascaaffect my brain Okay so we foundsomething quite interesting We found that your brainactivity became more complex  more diverse more rich more varied  under the ayahuasca than at baseline What does it mean to have more complex brain activity in terms of howI experience things Mm I thinkwe can understand it in terms of the richness of yourimagination of your ideas Trains of thoughtcan be more varied more changeablemore dynamic I definitely experienced thatYeah All right you lookednot just at my brain through the surfacebut you went deep inside  Yeah What did you notice there We looked at a particularbrain network  called the default mode network that seems to relate  to our sense of self or ego  Weve seen in other studies  that during a psychedelic experience  that network is dramatically compromised  It shows a kind of disintegration and actually that process relatesquite strongly to peoples ego dissolutionand yet after the experience  the network comes back as a kind of reset  or a kind of rebooting of the network  and what we found your brain after ayahuasca  as predicted was that your brain reset  The network became more cohesive  more integrated more strongly connected within itself  Wow Yeah afterwards I really did feel  much more interested with my identity my pastand my future YeahYou asked me a lot of questions before and after about my insightinto experiences YeahHow did those compare Well actually we saw somethingreally nice in those data So your ratings of insightfor the journey  the lower dose and then the higher dose with ayahuasca what we saw was thatthere was a graded increase  in your levels of insight  Your score at baseline was 27  After the lowdose experience it was 39  After the highdose ceremony it was 49  Wow I definitely felt like the larger  the ayahuasca dose the more I considered  and learned about myself Yeah Well RobinIm glad that we were able to do such a you knowintheenvironmenttype study So thank you for coming allthe way out to Peru with me I really appreciate itand I hope that I helped Yeah its beena great experience and Ive learned a lot As I look back on it now I feel like my experiencewith ayahuasca was one of resistance  Instead of surrendering myself to its effects  I dipped in and then got scared  and I told myself Itll be all right  Im not gonna die  but I shouldve just gone in and through I did however learn a lotabout how to control anxiety that relinquishing controland selfishness can make it vanishbut perhaps in doing so I lost the chance to experiencemy mind operating without the controlsand dampening Im so used to thatIm more comfortable with Scientists like Robinhave managed to break through tight legal restrictionssurrounding these substances and have begun to find outwhat they can teach us about the mind Their findings so farare just the beginning of our understandingof these powerful compounds which shows us how muchwe have yet to learn about the mind and brain And as alwaysthanks for watching theme

The Trolley Problem in Real Life,2017-12-06T17:05:03Z,34.63333333333333,15379077,348009,sneezes Excuse me You knowif I had been driving that wouldve beenpretty dangerous Every time you sneeze your eyes closefor about one second which means if you sneezewhile driving at say 70 miles per hour times 5280divided by 60 divided by 60 you will travel about 103 feetwith your eyes closed But dont worry This is a selfdriving car It uses sensors and softwareto drive itself to keep meand other people safe I hope tires screech ImpressiveBut let me ask you a question What if an autonomous vehiclehad to make a choice between hitting two peopleright in front of it or swerving to avoid them and hit one personon a sidewalk What shouldit be programmed to do tires screech car crashes What would you do Now polls and surveyshave been put together asking people what they think they would do but no researchershave ever put people in that actualtraumatic experience Would we learn more abouthuman nature if we did that Would it even be ethical to putpeople in that sort of position Im about to find out theme music playing In 1967 British philosopherPhilippa Foot created a precursor to ourselfdriving car conundrum The famous scenarioshe came up with is known asthe trolley problem Imagine theres a runaway trainhurtling down a train track Directly ahead of the train there are five peopleon the track Now imagine that you aretoo far away to help those five peoplebut right next to you theres a lever that can divertthe train onto another track If you divert the trainthe five people will be saved But heres the catch Theres another personon the second track Now youre faced with a dilemma You can either do nothing and the trainwill kill five people or you can pull the leverand save their lives but be directly responsiblefor one persons death What would you do When surveyed most people saythat theyd pull the lever and sacrifice one personto save five Its for the greater good But how we say wed actmay not match how wed actually act ifthe scenario really happened with real emotionsand real lives at stake Any difference between the twowould reveal who we are compared to who we want to bebut a comparison could only be made by doingwhat has never been done before making the trolley problem real Michael Suppose we conducted an experiment  in a realistic railroad switching station  with test subjects watching trains on monitors  The trains and the people on the tracks  would be staged and prerecorded  but the subjects would think it was all real  They would believe that they could control a lever  that switches the tracks  and theyd have the option to divert the train or not  Theyd be totally convinced that they have to choose  between five lives or one But waittheres a greatergood dilemma about doing an experimenton the greater good By forcing peopleto truly believe they might kill someoneare we risking serious psychological damageto them Yes it might be beneficial toall of us to see what happens but would those benefits beworth potential trauma to a few To actually conducta reallife trolley problem I needed to make sureit would be ethical  So I sat down with behavioral neuroscientist  Professor Aaron Blaisdell What you know aboutthe trolley problem and what previous studieshave found Most people saythey would pull the switch Sure its one life versus fiveThe math works out But what I want to knowis that if we actuallyput them in front of a switch watching a trainbarreling towards people would they actually pull itin that moment I bet a lot of themwould freezein that moment When youre afraid I think that shuts downa lot of action Id like to find outOkay What potential harms could cometo someone in that position Most peoplewould probably be fine but there isa small potential for harm in the sense of somebodybeing guiltridden over their decisionobsessive thoughts about Im the personwho would push that button and cause the train to goand kill somebody Or they might thinkIm the personwho would freeze and I wouldnt be ableto help those five people and that could be traumatic Have we ever testedthe trolley problem on human subjects for real To my knowledgewe have not Would you want to seethe trolley problem enacted in real life You know I would That would bevery informative abouthow people really react If I were tell youwere going to run thisOkay would you feel comfortable with that responsibilityon your shoulders No I couldnt do it For meto be involved in that it would have to be onthe shoulders of many people including an ethics board I couldnt justgo through with that Michael Dr Blaisdells reliance  on an ethics board made sense  Most universities have ethics review boards  to answer one crucial question When is it okay to riskpsychological harm in the name of science Narrator It is May 1962  An experiment is being conducted at Yale University Michael Ethics review boards were developed as a result  of some controversial psychological experiments  in the middle of the last century One theory is that peoplelearn things correctly whenever they get punishedfor making a mistake  buzzer Incorrect Youll now get a shockof 105 volts man grunts Michael Dr Stanley Milgram  tested how far subjects would go  in obeying authority even if they believed  they were physically hurting someone 330 volts man screams  No one was being electrocuted and the screams  of the shock victim were fake but the trauma  that the participants suffered was very real man You have no rightto hold me hereLet me out  This sparked controversy  within the scientific community  Many questioned Milgrams methodology  but unlike a research school Mind Field doesnt answer  to a universitys ethics committee  That said I wanted to get the thoughts  of an institutional review board  so I tracked one down and proposed my idea  for doing the trolley problem in real life Do you think I could reacha point where you would feel comfortableapproving this study I hate to be the bearerof bad tidings Michael Probably not Im not ready to say noquite yet I would loveto see your study pass and I actually thinkthe ways to make it pass is we should probablybe screening out for people who might have posttraumaticstress disorder you know any kind oflike clinical problem that could make themmore vulnerable to a type of event like thiswith the addition of something like a trauma counselor onsite I actually thinkthat under those circumstances it might passCan you present a compelling case as tothe social good of this study I agreeIf you could find a way to say Lookthis is why its important Its not just basictheoretical research This has direct implicationsfor mass transit direct implicationsfor selfdriving cars Its a riskbenefit but the benefitsare potentially tremendous Right and so my hopeis that the goodthis experiment does is in revealingthe differencebetween instinct and philosophical reflection and I think that therecould be an enormous benefit in learning the differenceso that we can train people to act in the waythat they wish they would David YeahNatasha Thats interesting Thats a compelling argumentNatasha Yeah I came into this meetingexpecting a lot of resistance but instead Im actuallyleaving invigorated like excited to taketheir concerns implement them into the study and make it not justmore acceptable which I thoughtwas the purpose here but to actually make itmore beneficial more fascinatingand penetrate deeper and have more applicationsin society So I decided we were readyto move forward to turn oneof the most notorious hypothetical ethical dilemmasinto a reality train horn blowing  We traveled to an abandoned railroad line  and hired a freight train  Our subjects needed to be shown how switch points work  So the Mind Field production team  shot a video of a train going down two tracks  Then we dressed six actors like railroad workers  Since we didnt want them to be at actual risks of harm  we took steps to make sure they were safe Youre all going to beworkers on the track We will not havethe train moving while you are on the tracks Michael We filmed our actors on the tracks  wearing ear protection and looking distracted  to explain why they couldnt hear  a train coming toward them  Then in editing we employed visual effects  to create the illusion of the train approaching  We then combined the shots together  During the experiment we would play the video  for our subjects who would believe  the action was happening live  and transmitted from remote cameras  Our next step was to find an expert  who would be willing to guide me through the process  of selecting our subjects  in order to minimize psychological harm So what should I beworried about The worst would probably beposttraumatic stress disorder and thats whentheyre going to bereexperiencing the trauma Theyll keep thinkingabout it over and over and so to limit risk youdwant to screen out people prone toa traumatic reaction and then afterwardsdo the debrief Thats the keyto limit harmfrom happening How are they feelingat this moment Whats going on with them You can start to ease theminto the reality of what isinstead of what theythought it was Would you be willing to help usconduct this experiment Oh uh yes I meanI think I would I think this isa really fascinating and valuable experimentbecause people can have very uncomfortable lessons thatthey then start to learn from If I can make surethat we get peoplewho may be appropriate to do such a thingI would be honored woman Im calling regardinga study were doing for highspeed railway I wanted to know if youmight be interested in participating next week Michael To disguise the true nature of our experiment  we placed an online ad recruiting people  for a fake focus group to offer feedback  on Californias new highspeed rail Today Im just going to ask youto fill out a couple forms to make sure that theresa range of personality types in our groupand for TSA security purposes Michael These psychological surveys  used frequently by employers  look to uncover signs of depression anxiety  and other conditions that might make someone  unsuitable to participate in this experiment Thank you very muchHave a great day Thank you  Back in Dr Casons office  we reviewed the potential subjects responses This particular personI was concerned about this Some high suicidal thinkinghigh acting out Those kindsof factors might not begood in an experiment where you wantto try to prevent some of the traumafrom happeningRight These people though and theresa large group of them they are more resilient So I would be more comfortablewith these people because their abilityto bounce back in difficult situationsmight make them less susceptibleto a trauma Michael Finally after consulting two psychologists  and a university ethics board  it was time to put our plan into action Michael This is where weregoing to physically create the trolley problemin real life not with a trolleybut with a train Our subjects will sign inat this booth for our phony focus test which will neveractually take place Its going to bea hot day for them So well offer themwhile they wait for the actual test to beginthe chance to sit inside this nice airconditionedremote switching station Inside theyll meet a kindlytrainswitch operator supposedly an employee of the CaliforniaRailroad Authority The California RailroadAuthority is real Real fake  We invented this nonexistent government organization  to convince our subjects that everything here is real  including these monitors showing supposedly live shots of actual trainsfrom different tracks all around the California area horn blows While the participantis waiting inside this room  theyll learn how the operator switches the tracks  using a lever to remotely switch a train  from one track to another  Theyll see it happen Were actually controllingthe video on these screens froma different hidden control room  At a given time the switch operator  will leave the subject alone in the switching station And at that pointa crisis will occur brakes hisshorn blows A train will be barrelingdown the tracks  and workers will have made their way out to both tracks  five on one one worker on his phone on the other No one is around for themto alert who has any kind of controlor authority  Switching the train is up to the subject alone  Theyll feel like what they do has realworld consequences train horn blowsWill five people die or will one horn blows Our first participantis almost here so its time for meto get ready Dr Casonhow are you feeling GoodMy hypothesis is that were going seepeople immediately when they hearthat first warning leave the station and not wantto get back inside The other optionwould be of coursethe freeze action wherethey dont do anything cause they dont knowwhat to do In that casewe want to knowtheir thought process Itll be interestingto see This has neverbeen done before All right well here we go warning bells clanging Michael Our first subject is Elsa woman Do you wanna stand over here in the shade Hi Im Elsanice to meet you Nice to meet you Elsa Michael Everyone she meets is an actor  and all of our cameras are hidden  so she has no idea that shes being watched Oh yeahthank you so much and then my phoneif I can Thank you Michael Our subjects were told that the technology  theyre about to see is proprietary  This gave us an excuse to collect their phones  so they couldnt call for help during the imminent crisis Thank you so muchfor coming out todayThank you What were doing here isthe California RailroadAuthority  theyre developing highspeed trains And so we want the publicto come in and give us some feedback on howcomfortable they arethe decor you know Oh wowAll that kind of stuff cell phone chirpsUm oh shoot Theyre running a littlebehind from the last one Thats okaySo its just gonna be likeanother 15 maybe 20 minutes Yeah thats fine yeahNo problem Um you know whatIve got an idea Okay Michael Now Elsa believes  she has to wait for 20 minutes knock on doorYeah  Our actress pretends to ask permission  for her to wait inside the switching station So actuallythis isnt part of it This is a remotetrainswitching station but since its gonna bea little bit and itsnice and cool andairconditioned in there  I just talked to Eddie and he said it would be totally greatfor you to come in Oh yeah okayand just check it out Okay cooland see what theydo in there Eddie this is Elsa How are you ElsaIm good how are you Good come on inhave a seat So what brings you out this way Um the focus grouplaughs Focus group Yes the highspeed railroadThe luxury railroad  Okay So what we got here is a remote switching station These are all live feeds Whats happening is theresa lot of construction going on Were going to have to putall new ballast through here new ribbon railright here on these Michael In case youre wondering we hired an actor  who actually spent 20 years working on railroads  Can you imagine if we had an actor who didnt know a lot about trains  Greg He offers something called face validity  in that you can look him and you think Ah this guys real My job here is totake care of all the switching right here on thesetwo tracks right now And so there needs to be someonein here all the time Now the other thingabout this female voice Attention train approaching This is probablya work unit thats coming UhhuhWere gonna divert itto track two Okay so a trains coming Nows a chance for herto learn how the switch works Ah very good In fact why dont you bethe one to do that Just go aheadand throw it yourself Pull it downRight now Yeah go ahead Good Its going much fasterthan you think All right its gonnamake the transitionto track number two Well I tell you whatYoure now a switchman both laugh Okay wellnow that the trailing car is clear of the switch points go ahead and switch it backto track one OkayThat was kind of scary I was like oh my goshI have to turn it Well just you wait The good thing is weve got itback on line one and that meansthat the next trainthat comes through will go through on track one Michael Elsa now understands exactly  where the trains will go  switch one to the left switch two to the right  It was time to force her to make a very difficult decision cell phone ringsHang on Oh I gotta take thisOh yeah sure no problem Do me a favor Wait right hereOkay Someone has to be hereat all times Okay no problem Im just gonna go outand take care of this Okay no problem OkayBe back in a sec  Greg Look at her eyes  cause shes concerned immediately a little worriedlike What Michael We gave Elsa a couple of minutes  to acclimate to her surroundings and then  we started the playback of our staged footage  Michael All right here come the workers female voice Attention object on track Yep she just noticed them  Attention object on track  Attention object on track  Attention object on track  Greg Shes looking in her purse to find Michael No phone no phone  Attention object on track  Attention object on track  Michael I think the warning does a lot If youre in that stationyoure supposed to do something  Attention object on track  Okay here comes the train train horn blows  Attention train approaching Heres the train approachingwarning  Attention object on track  Greg I dont think at this oh there she goes  Attention train approaching Theres a train approaching woman What I wanted to let him know thattheres a train approaching Oh my God okayCan you tell him Yeah I will go look for himright now Michael But the switch operator wont be coming back  The full weight of this crisis is all on Elsa female voice Attention train approaching Whoa whoa whoa Attention object on track  Attention train approaching Greg I cant believe this  Attention object on track  Attention train approaching  Attention object on track  Attention train approaching  Attention object on track  End of test Everyone is safe  End of test Everyone is safe OkayMichael We didnt want  the participants to think that anyone actually got hurt  So we showed them this everyone is safe card  before the train would have actually hit anyone ElsaIm Michael HiAnd this is Greg This was all an experimentOkay Can we come on in We want to ask youa few questions Yeah sureDid I do something wrong Not at allHow are you feeling right now chucklesUm just scared Go ahead and take a seatGreg Scared YesSo no one was in any danger This is a psychologicalexperiment that were conducting on how people behavewhen decisions need to be made Oh okayWalk me through how you felt I felt the pressureIm like Oh my gosh these people are gonna die I had to make a very quickand sound decision like immediately right nowright this second  Their lives were in my hands  I need to change it to track two Michael What was motivating your decision to switch So I can save more lives I didnt know if I wasmaking the right decision I meana life is a life right Michael So when confronted with two terrible choices  at least one person was capable of taking  deliberate action to sacrifice one in order to save five  But we wanted to see if Elsas reaction was typical Need my phoneYes please Would you be interestedin highspeed transportation Oh yeah anythingthat cuts throughcell phone rings Shoot sorry I just got a textIm so sorry Why dont you havea look in there and see the trains running Oh itsso much nicer in herethan it is out there When I first started out I usedto have to stand out in the sun WhatDo you know whenthe next trains coming Theres one comingright thereHe has a great eye female voice Attention train approaching Michael As with Elsa every subject received a lesson  in how to switch the tracks Why dont you go aheadand switch them Right hereYeah Go aheadHow does that feel I was like exhilaratedI was like I got nervous cell phone ringsOne second Let me check thisHang on one sec Ah Someone has to be in herethe whole time I got it yep Im hereOkay Hellolaughing Breaker onenineroger copy that Hes actuallytapping into the powerof being in that position female voice Attention object on track MichaelHere comes the test  Attention object on track  Attention train approaching Greg Shes not moving  Attention train approaching Just watch his eyebrows Michael Oh yeah  Eyes are going back and forth  Train approaching  Oh shes worried Yeah  Train approaching I dont know what I would doin this kind of scenario  Train approaching This is sort of thatfrozen pose that we see  Paralysis in the face of danger is such a common reaction  Attention object on track  Attention train approaching  Object on track Michael Even with the train seconds away  some are still looking for others to take control Ill go tryand find him Okay  sings softly Shes singing This is selfsoothingthere yeah female voice Object on track Attention  Shes not moving Oh my gosh wow  Okay Is she gonna switch it  Train approaching Attention object on track  Attention  End of test Everyone is safe WhatAll right lets go Michael Not one of these participants pulled the lever  Time to find out why Michael Hello JR Oh my goshHow you guys doing My names MichaelJR Everything that just happenedwas an experiment laughs This was an experiment Oh my goshOkay What were you feelingwhen you were watching that Terrified I I just I was feelinga little anxiouswhen I saw the train cominglike Oh my God Your heart is beating fastYeah a little bit yeah Tell me what was goingthrough your mind when you heard that first warningthat a train was approaching I thoughtabout switching it but thenactually acting on itwas a different thing I kind of suspendedmy responsibility Like I didntknow what to doso I was just like Oh I better nottouch it you knowbecause I dont know if Illscrew something up I would assumethat there would be out of those five guyssomeone wouldve looked back They were gonna getout of the way of the train was alreadyplanning to stop I think they probably builtthose trains with some type of sensoror something like that Michael The train probably had sensors  The workers wouldve noticed  I didnt want to touch the equipment  These are all forms of attribution  when an individual assumes that others  are either responsible for taking action  or have already done so Both trackshad people on themRight And I just didnt know whoshould live and who should die Do I switch itdo I not switch it I mean either waysomeones gonna getreally badly hurt I didnt want that power It was quitequite the test I would say Michael It is quite the test  At this point one subject  had switched the tracks and five others had not  But we werent done yet Meet Cory Here have a seatMuch obliged thank you This is cool This whole modulewill interconnect with the entire nationif we wanted it to But right now were lookingat just track one on the left track two through there NiceThese are manymany miles away YeahBut theyre all live feeds Surveying the sceneEagles point of view cell phone ringsYeah Let me see what this is Okay Ill be right backOkay got it  Greg Hes remaining engaged  Michael Here come the workers Oh no female voice Attention object on track Uh yeah So he realizes theresa potential problem  I think hes gonna go out  Attention train approaching Um theres a train comingUm Greg Okay  Attention object on track Uh yeah  Attention train approaching Okay he realizes theresno one there its urgent Okayso this needs to go to  Attention object on track  Greg Okay hes rehearsing what to do  Attention train approaching Oh Track two Do they not know  Attention train approaching I knowThey should see this  Object on track Attention train approaching  Attention object on track train horn blows  Attention object on track Oh my God  End of test Okay good  Everyone is safe HelloHi Cory my names Michael There was just aalmost an accidentseemingly Cory everything that justhappened was an experimentOkay No one was in dangerFor sure These were just loopsof video taken before This is a psychology experimentlooking at how people behave Okay Okay yeahin various circumstances So tell mehow you were feeling Mainly a bunch of terrorGreg Terror And responsibilitybecause I was at the helm And just horrifiedabout making a decision between likefive people compared to one It was very scaryto say the least It was scary rightYeah Oh yeah What was going throughyour mind as the trains comingdown the track It was mainly to warn them There arejust to reiterate Whats coming upWhats coming up right now You dont want to haveto choose between people Right And that was really tough Either like six familiesor one family It was like up to meit felt like Yeah It was interesting to me thatyou had such presence of mind Michael Yeah look for help and make a decision The one that everyoneif you ask them in a survey says that they would liketo be brave enough to make Yes so that was impressiveCory it really was Thank you You know I think it wouldbe good to have you meet some of the people whoparticipated so you can seeAwesome Yeah lets go do thatjust follow us on out and meet the actorsAwesome Michael Cory showed us just how important  the debrief was in this situation  Meeting the actors which all of our subjects did  reinforced that this was not a reality So Greg trolley problem MmhmmI went into this thinking were going to tease outsome general truthsabout human nature Howeverwhat weve really seen is that you learna lot about the individual RightEveryone had some explanationfor their behavior YesEach one was different Yes each one person toldthemselves a story about what was happeningaccording to the facts and their analysisof the surroundings and what was going onat the moment but its also basedon their own backgroundand experience Totally there were peoplewho were just frozen  realizing something was wrong and they werent prepared  Greg JR was a great example of that He evaluated everythingbut at some point just said You knowI dont know what to do Other peoplewere ready to sayYou know what  This isnt on me Its on the technology  Im sure its being taken care of by others  Whereas someone like Cory  someone like Elsa said switch clicks  No I have  to take control click They still had some ofthose same thoughts but I think what happenedis they realized that if they did notdo something more people would be hurt Neither of themreally wanted to do something They both felt compelledto do something cause theyhad to save lives  So was it worth doing the trolley experiment  I think it was definitely worth it  Some of these participants if not all of them  learned something about human behavior  Although it was a difficult experience  Elsa learned what inner strength she had  and I think we had saw that with Cory as well Every single one ofour participants felt like they just contributedto somethingRight And they feel the valueof what just happened YeahIts not just us Wow Weve since followed upwith our subjects and all of them are doing well Im glad we minimized risk by prescreeningvulnerable individuals debriefing the participantsand providing onsite counseling because doing sogave me confidence that we could explore this facetof human psychology ethically We learned that theresa stark difference between what peoplethink they would do and what they actually dowhen faced with a difficult moral dilemma Instead of saving five lives most of our participantsdid nothing but is it wrong to freeze Should people feel badfor being unable to act Well heres the thing Freezing in the face of a threatis a behavior that can be foundall over the animal kingdom but we are the only animalsthat can study how we act pontificateon how we ought to act and program machinesto do only that To make progressin our study of the mind we have to affect the mind and thats not somethingthat we should take lightly Understanding who we areby taking ourselves to the limit comes with a riskand as weve learned that riskmust always be balanced against the greater good And as alwaysthanks for watching  This season on Mind Field Youre goingto be a lab ratin a maze  Nobodys ever done this before Its quite pioneering workreally As far

Which Way Is Down?,2017-11-02T09:30:54Z,26.183333333333334,28741238,653545,Hey Vsauce Michael here Down here But which way is down And how much does down weigh Well down weighs about a 100th of a gram per cubic centimeter It is light and airy which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for water birds But if you let go of down It falls down So thats which way down is Its the direction gravity is pulling everything in Now for someone on the other side of the Earth my down is their up But where are falling things going Why do things fall Are they being pushed or pulled or is it because of time travel First things first lets turn the Sun into a black hole We can do that using Universe Sandbox 2 this simulator will blow your mind I love it In fact I love it so much I put a code to get the game for free in the current Curiosity Box If youre not subscribed to the box yet you are missing out Okay look for the purposes of this video we want the Solar System And here it is Notice that everythings moving pretty quickly around the Sun Thats because we currently have the game set so that every second that passes for us is 14 days almost in the game If I change this to one second were looking at the Solar System in real time Youll notice that it almost looks like its frozen Even though the earth is traveling around the Sun at about 30 kms it barely appears to be moving That is how vast space is Anyway lets go back to 14 days I like that motion Now look at the Sun It is not currently a black hole but we can change that What we need to do is compress the Sun So lets lock its mass so that it doesnt change while we make its radius smaller Lets make its radius as small as we can And oh whered it go Well its still there its just become a black hole Pretty spooky but now lets look at the rest of the Solar System Alright zooming out and huh Nothings changed I mean somethings changed Its colder and darker but nothings flying off into space or getting sucked in You see  by shrinking the Sun we didnt change the direction of down for the planets Theyre always being pulled by gravity towards its middle and making it smaller didnt move where the middle was But also the strength of that force pulling them to the middle of the sun stayed the same That gives us a clue as to what down is The clue is the other thing we didnt change mass Mass is a measure of how hard it is to accelerate something to change its motion Now right now these two balls have zero motion relative to me Slapping around this hollow plastic ball is pretty easy but doing the same to this solid steel ball is a lot harder Now gravity and weight have nothing to do with this Gravity acts downward not against my horizontal slapping Of course gravity does contribute to friction but friction works against me when I start moving the ball but works with me when I stop the ball And the steel ball is harder to stop than the plastic ball The difference is mass The steel ball is more massive Its more resistant to having its motion changed Mass is an intrinsic property it does not depend on whats around or change from place to place It can sometimes be thought of as the amount of matter something has Your mass is the same regardless of where you are On the moon on earth in the middle of intergalactic space floating around But all of this said mass does seem to care about whats around Mass loves company Things with mass andor energy are attracted together by a force that we call gravity The feeling of gravity is just you and the earth being attracted to one another Now every portion of an object with mass attracts other portions towards it The average of all this pulling is an attraction between centers of mass Giant things like Earth exert an obvious pull but everything does Even a baseball These two baseballs are attracted together by their own gravities Except their masses are so small the force is minuscule and it cant overcome friction or push air out of the way Theyre never gonna come together But if you put two baseballs one meter apart in the middle of empty space where no other forces could act on them They would literally fall together and collide It would take three days to happen but it would Isaac Newton found that the strength of the force bringing two things together is equal to the product of their masses Divided by the distance between their centers of mass squared times big G the gravitational constant If you make one of two objects more massive or move them closer together the force will be stronger and this force of attraction is what we call weight So mass is intrinsic whereas weight depends on whats around Now a weird thing happens when you weigh yourself on most scales Weight is a force but scales display pounds or kilograms which are units of mass Whats going on is that a scale is activated by a force Any force It doesnt have to be caused by gravity The scale then displays what amount of mass near the surface of the earth would be attracted to the earth with the force its detecting Now since scales tend to be used on the surface of the earth by people on which the only force acting is gravity they tend to not be very far off But they can be easily tricked and they further lead to the confusion between mass and weight Notice that weight is mutual You are pulled down by earth with the same force that you pull up on earth According to a scale I weigh 180 pounds on earth And the earth weighs 180 pounds on me But because the Earths mass is so much greater than my own and because the more massive something is the more it resists being moved our equal and opposite weight forces accelerate me a lot more than the earth If you drop a pencil from a height of 6 feet the pencil doesnt just fall to the earth More precisely they both come together Theyre attracted to each other by equal forces but the same force moves the pencil a lot more than the earth When you let go of the pencil the earth is literally pulled up to the pencil by the pencils own gravity a distance equal to about 9 trillionths the width of a proton That same force moves the pencil the remaining distance which is still pretty much six feet At the height of the International Space Stations orbit you and earth are attracted about 10 less than when youre on the surface about eight point eight times your mass but not zero For this reason weightless astronauts in zero gravity are neither weightless nor in zero gravity Their weight force fails to bring them and earth together because they move horizontally so quickly that they fall just as fast as Earths surface curves away from them And even though theyre experiencing 90 percent of the gravity you and I are feeling right now Thats why they dont just fly away There are no forces called gforces to resist their weight since everything around them is falling too Its resistance to your weight force stress deformation that is needed for you to feel weight What astronauts in orbit actually lack is apparent weight Likewise a helium balloon has weight I mean its made out of matter it clearly has mass so its attracted to the earth Lets try to measure its weight force Okay it has negative apparent weight Thats because its attraction to the earth is weaker than the buoyant forces from the air around it that push it up Now while it moves up It pushes air molecules down but they transfer that force widely Not just directly down onto the scale Buoyant forces are caused by the fact that whenever you are immersed in a fluid like water or air molecules lower down are at greater pressure Theyre being pressed by the weight of all the molecules above them and are closer to earth so theyre pulled to it with a stronger force Now having greater pressure means they pack a bigger punch when they collide with things So horizontally those collisions cancel out but vertically the stronger collisions from below win out providing lift a buoyant force This even happens on your own body Across its surface area air lifts you with the force of about one Newton which is equal to the weight force of an apple So if you weighed yourself in a vacuum you would weigh about this much more But thats not all Earths spin causes it to bulge at the equator so the closer you are to it The further you are from Earths center of mass and the less your actual gravitational weight will be down is Always changing I mean where is Earths center of mass It would always be the same as Earths geometric middle if Earths composition was uniform but earth contains pockets of massive rock at different depths water mountains Its got moving changing insides and air and seasonal ice and though theyre far away Gravity extends forever from everything so the moon the Sun the planets all of them pull on you negligibly But truly You weigh about a millionth of your weight less when the moon is directly above you This chunky shifting balance of material on earth and ever where else in the universe means that down is always changing on top of that Earths spin Skews what you consider the direction of down away from its center of mass because the push you get from Earths spin Seems to slightly lift you reducing your apparent weight and bending down towards the equator The net result is an apparent weight reduction at the equator of about half of a percent if a scale guesses your mass must be 200 pounds at the poles itll guess that youre 199 at the equator The 98 Multiplier used so often in physics is calculated based on how these factors affect someone at 45 degrees latitude all of these influences on the direction of down result in a total vertical deflection Thats only ever at most a few arc seconds anywhere on earth Thats not enough to be felt but changes in direction and strength can be used to study the shape of the seafloor Determine whats under you or even help you discover ancient buried rooms Point is all of our downs arent a bunch of radially symmetric lines Down is an uncombed mess Now since solids dont flow they can have shapes that dont pay much mind to this but water can Flow so ignoring influences like wind and tides the surface of oceans and lakes and puddles is always perpendicular To down if water could pass through land or if earth were submerged in water Gravity would be the same everywhere along its bumpy surface Such a surface is called a geoid and can be drawn at any altitude If you wanted to build a table that completely enclosed the earth it would have to have rolling undulation Z nearly 100 meters at some points in order to be Level so that a ball placed anywhere on it wouldnt roll Here is Earths G I exaggerated a thousand times Youd weigh about a hundredth of a percent less a few grams here Then you would say here where gravity is a bit stronger point is the strength and direction Down is variable by location and changes over time So down is a fluctuating vector easy enough except Why should matter attract matter in the first place Isaac Newton was able to describe attraction but not explain it humanity got closer however when Albert Einstein introduced his general theory of relativity Einstein thought a lot about the fact that everything falls to the ground At the same rate no matter How massive something is when dropped it will accelerate towards the earth down gaining about 98 Meters per second for every second that it falls That means that a hammer Thats quite massive and a not so massive feather when dropped from the same height will hit the ground at the same time Okay what just happened was an airror awkward laugh In order to fall through air a thing has to push air out of the way But if it has a large surface area and a low weight force it will have a lot of air to move But wont be able to move that air very quickly In a vacuum things do fall at the same rate regardless Of mass This was famously demonstrated by Apollo 15 commander David Scott on the moon And Ill uh drop the two of them here and hopefully theyll hit the ground at the same time How bout that Thats weird right I mean if a more massive object is pulled with a greater force Shouldnt it fall faster Well Newtons explanation was simple Larger masses are attracted with greater forces But will also require more force to be accelerated the same as a less massive thing Something a hundred times more massive might require a hundred times the force but it will be pulled by gravity 100 times more so everything falls to earth at the same rate What a fun coincidence right Maybe not Einstein realized that theres another way for things to appear to fall together of their masses Imagine a feather and a hammer floating in space in a room if the room is suddenly accelerated up at 98 Ms2 the feather and the hammer will hit the floor at the same time furthermore whether its the room coming up to meet them or gravity being suddenly switched on Neither object will feel any force pushing them Theres no way to tell which of these happen This is Einsteins famous equivalence principle He once admitted that his greatest thought ever was that of a man falling off of a roof While falling the man would not feel any forces on him even though Hes speeding up freefall is Indistinguishable from floating alone in space from having no forces on you from not being moved What if gravity isnt a force at all what if things fall not because theyre being pushed or pulled But because theyre not being pushed or pull To see how this could be we need to talk about straight lines What I have here is a retractable ID badge holder This is a great way to test for straight paths Because the string is always kept taut the card I have behind has two lines drawn on it And if while I pull the string out it always stays between those two lines I will know that I never turned While I pulled it because any turn will translate into a different angle between the lines on the card and the string Now if I put two of these on a flat table and pull them out always ensuring that they go straight ahead They will never meet They will be forever parallel but now lets put them on a sphere a curved surface Again I pull both strings forward making sure that they always are pulled out straight No turning Wait they came together Well they didnt turn look Maybe theres some kind of weird force that pulled my hands together and just like gravity I didnt feel it but it happened No What happened was not the result of a force it was just a natural result of Curvature you might be thinking wait a second are those really straight lines I mean they dont look that straight to me Also what if theyve just moved along latitude lines then theyve never come together and those look pretty darn straight But theyre not a straight line never turns and although latitude lines look straight at first glance following one requires Turning to find straight line paths on surfaces whether theyre flat like this or curved I love the ribbon test Now you can use an actual ribbon But I have found that a strip of paper works Even better Lets take a look at this path right here Its straight at first but then it curves now if two people are traveling along this curve And they want to stay together the person on the inside will have to cover a shorter distance than the person on the outside Since both sides of this strip of paper cannot change their lengths Theyll help us find a straight path if the strip of paper can lay flat Well know that we have found a straight line and as you can see The strip can lay flat and follow the straight part of this path But when it comes to the curve in order to follow the path now The strip well it has too much material on the inside and that material Bunches up and leaves the plane therefore we know that this part of the path is not straight Lets use the ribbon test to find straight lines on the surface of a cone Well from the looks of it aligned directly from the base to the tip seems like it would be straight and sure enough Yeah the ribbon lays flat on that path but what about a ring around the cone Nope doesnt work shorter distances around nearer the tip of the cone mean that theres too much ribbon up at the top So doesnt lay flat Lets see what else is there though besides this well if I start here and just allow the ribbon to lay flat Huh I get a little curvy looking shape like this I say curvy looking because while to someone say at the base this path might seem to go up Slow down change direction and then fall down faster and faster since a ribbon on such a path is flat Its actually for inhabitants on the cones surface Perfectly straight if we trace the ribbons path on to the cone We can see this clearly because a cone can be flattened a straight line on a curved surface is called a geodesic Here is a geodesic on a sphere the Equator is one Heres another a line of latitude is not a geodesic Its not a straight line to see why lets try to follow it with the ribbon you Know what I have to keep kind of lifting it Yeah see distances around the sphere becomes shorter as we go up So theres too much material on the ribbon up here and it leaves the surface this path contains turns and in order to turn a Force has to act on you if no forces Did this is the path you would take notice that the ribbon begins moving due east but then falls south Falls Einstein realized that curvature could cause things to be seemingly attracted to one another Without needing to invent the existence of forces like gravity but attraction only happens if things move along the surface if they stay still they Well they dont come together so for something at rest How does falling begin I mean the thing has to move in this direction but its at rest right well Yes But its only at rest in space and thats not the whole story up down Forward backward and leftright are all you need to describe where an event occur but a complete description will also need to describe When together these four dimensions form the setting in which everything in our universe happens Spacetime Since we can talk about a falling pencil using just one spatial dimension up and down we can use a piece of paper to model Spacetime for it Okay so weve got up and down but we have to add another direction the pencil moves in time Now if no forces act on the pencil it wont move through space It will only get older and as you can see if all it does is get older It wont fall if spacetime was flat when I let go of the pencil it wouldnt go anywhere but now lets allow the earth which is massive to manipulate spacetime into say a cone Now with no forces acting on it every part of the pencil follows a straight line But on a cone as we saw earlier such a path will look like this it will fall This is because distances around the cone are shorter higher up Time runs faster further from a massive object but to go straight Not turn every part of the pencil must cover an equal distance in spacetime like this Only when the pencil hits the earth does the repulsion of their mutual electrons provide a force pushing the pencil off a geodesic For the earth time is a series of slices from this evolution the pencils forcefree Geodesic is why it falls not a push or pull just the pencils natural tendency to follow a straight line Until something acts on it now We only used one dimension of space and one of time because Visualizing our universes three of space and one of time would take us beyond the limits of what could be shown on paper or screens but math Can take us there General relativity allows us to calculate how much mass and energy Curved spacetime and has been used to explain things that Newtons older theory of falling as the result of Forces couldnt like anomalies in the orbit of mercury which orbits nearest the Sun and is therefore most affected by the suns grip on spacetime many other experiments have confirmed general relativitys picture of the universe fitting the conclusion that There is no Gravity theres just Spacetime its curvature and a us in it As John Wheeler famously put it Spacetime grips mass telling it how to move mass grips spacetime telling it how to curve Relative to the earth we dont move very fast even jet airplanes move negligibly close to the speed of light So relative to earth we move almost Exclusively through time as such we are more affected by the way time is curved by mass Than how space is curved This has led many to claim that for the most part you feel as though youre being pushed into the ground Not because of a force called gravity But because time is moving faster for your head than for your feet down is Relative and always changing but it exists because of and is always in the direction of slower time Bertrand Russell called this the law of cosmic laziness Everything is naturally steered towards where time is slowest we call this falling going down So you dont have to keep anything on

The Napkin Ring Problem,2017-08-14T15:06:31Z,10.733333333333333,13891355,377530,Hey Vsauce Michael here If you core a sphere that is remove a cylinder from it youll be left with a shape called a Napkin ring because well it looks like a napkin ring Its a bizarre shape because if two Napkin rings have the same height well theyll have the same volume regardless of the size of the spheres they came from Cool This means that if you cut equally tall napkin rings from an orange and from the Earth well one could be held in your hand The other would have the circumference of our entire planet but both would have the same volume I mentioned this counterintuitive fact while making a Kendama with Adam Savage Check that video out if you havent or better yet just come see us Were bringing brain candy live to 24 new cities this fall Its going to be busy but right now Were talking about balls and coring them I have here TWO napkin rings from very differently sized spheres one is from a tiny ball just a little tomato that Ive cored so its got a little hole in it right there The other Napkin ring is made from an orange but both Napkin rings have the same height The tomato has a smaller circumference than the orange which means less volume but its ring is thicker which means more volume Both of those effects exactly cancel out So these two napkin rings have identical volumes they take up the same amount of space By the way orange oil is flammable To see why the napkin ring problem is true lets discuss Cavalieris principle It states that for any two solids like these two cylinders Ive built here sandwiched between parallel planes if any other parallel plane Intersects both in regions of equal area no matter where its taken from Well then the solids have the same volume Thats clearly true here these cylinders are built out of stacks of VSauce stickers 100 in each Stack so their volumes are the same if I Skew one of them like this it shape will change but its volume hasnt its still contained the same amount of stuff I havent added or subtracted stickers And Cavalieris principle ensures that they still have the same volume because any crosssection taken from down here up here in the middle anywhere Will always give us a region of the same area as the other because those regions are always equal area circles Now lets Apply Cavalieris principle to Napkin Rings We can see that two napkin Rings with similar Heights have identical volumes by showing that when cut by a plane the area of ones cross section Always equals the area of the others now to do this Notice that the area of the spheres cross section minus the area of the cylinders cross section gives us the area of the Napkin rings Cross section Depending on where we slice the Napkin ring the cross sections will have different areas But they will always be the same as each other Lets calculate the areas of these blue rings first of all lets call the height of the Napkin ring h and the radius of the sphere theyre cut from capital R Alright perfect now a cross section of a sphere like this and a cross section of a cylinder like this are both circles So their areas can be determined by using Pi times the radius squared So if we want to find the area of the spheres cross section and subtract the area of the cylinders cross section Ill draw a picture of a cylinder here all we need to do is take Pi multiply it by the radius of the sphere cross section Square that and then subtract Pi times the radius of the cylinder Squared but what are their Radii Well if this is the center of the sphere we can draw a line straight up to the corner of the cylinder down the side of the cylinder and then connect to form a right triangle The Pythagorean Theorem will really help us here it tells us that the length of one side squared plus the length of the other side squared equals the length of the hypotenuse squared Now this distance right here this side of the triangle what we want Its the radius of the cylinder so well call this the little r radius of the cylinder beautiful little picture there so the radius of the cylinder squared plus this side length which is just half the height of the cylinder so the height of the cylinder divided by 2 squared Equals the hypotenuse squared the hypotenuse happens to be the radius of the sphere itself which is capital R Perfect now lets solve for the radius of the cylinder Which is what we want Well just subtract h over 2 squared from both sides thatll give us the radius of the cylinder squared equaling the radius of the sphere squared minus Half the height of the cylinder squared We can take the square root of both sides so that we wind up with the radius of the cylinder equaling the square root of the radius of the sphere minus 12 the height of the cylinder squared Perfect ok now lets take a look at the area of a crosssection of the sphere now for this lets draw a straight line from the center out to the edge of the spheres Crosssection and well go straight down and connect back up hey look Another right triangle lets call this height y And notice that this distance now the side of the triangle down here is actually the radius   of the circle Crosssection up here Theyre both equal so we even want to solve for this the radius of the circle that is the spheres crosssection Okay so we know that the radius of The spheres CrossSection squared plus this distance squared which is y Equals the hypotenuse squared well what do you know the hypotenuse is the radius of the sphere again capital R Ok lets subtract y squared from both sides the radius of the spheres crosssection squared equals the radius of the sphere squared minus Y squared will take the square root of both sides and end up learning that the radius of the spheres crosssection equals the square root of The radius of the sphere squared minus y squared Y is the height that this Crosssection is taken from above the equator the higher up we take these cross sections of the sphere the smaller their radii will be Whereas the cylinders radius is always the same no matter where we cut from Anyway lets take these two Radii and plug them into our formula Okay the area of the cross section of the sphere is what we want first Okay thats just the square root of R squared minus y squared Not too bad now the radius of the cylinder is the square root of R squared minus Half the height of the cylinder squared now what you might notice is that were taking the square root of something and then squaring it These actually cancel each other out perfect Much more simple looking But now lets distribute Pi to the terms inside the parentheses so pi times R squared gives us Pi R Squared Pi times negative y squared gives us negative pi y squared Then a negative Pi times R squared is negative pi R squared negative Pi times negative h over 2 squared is positive Pi h over 2 Squared Great now we can keep simplifying but what you might notice is that we have a pi r squared and a minus Pi R squared well that equals 0 so these Completely cancel each other out but what were left with are Terms containing no mention of the spheres Radius whether the radius is large or small Doesnt matter all you need to know to find the area of the cross section of a napkin ring is the height of the Napkin Ring Y of course is bounded by the height of a napkin ring these blue areas have the same area as each other and this will Be true no matter where we cut the cross section across the napkin ring meaning by Cavalieris principle that both Napkin Rings have the same Volume Yay 3 with teeth But what is this mean for you for life in the universe Well as we know if you like it you should put a ring on it but if you like It dont know its finger width and only want to offer it a predetermined amount of material you should put a napkin ring on it And as always Thanks for watching D On August 21st 2017 there will be a total solar eclipse the shadow of the Moon will race across the Contiguous United States Its going to be incredible and a little bit scary Im sure I will be viewing it from Oregon with my friends at Atlas Obscura I cant wait but keep your eyes Safe if you want to view the eclipse you have to have special eye protection the curiosity Box comes with such glasses these block 99999 of visible light thats what it takes to be able to look right at the sun as actually what I love about these glasses Theres no eclipse going on You can still just look at the sun Notice that its a ball Maybe imagine what kind of Napkin ring Youd like to make it into The current Curiosity box is my favorite The one that youll get if you subscribe right now comes with all kinds of cool stuff that comes with A poster showing that all the planets and pluto can fit between the earth and the moon it also comes with science gadgets like these levitating magnetic rings pretty cool also a portion of all proceeds go to

How Much of the Earth Can You See at Once?,2017-07-17T15:37:19Z,26.516666666666666,19265105,388740,foreign Michael here and here I am the real Michael this Michael was created by a brilliant young man named Mitchell who brought it to me at a meet and greet after brain candy live it is phenomenal and obviously the most handsome JackintheBox ever EST is a mountain thats 8848 kilometers tall its size is impressive or is it lets cut Earth the entire planet right in half straight through Everest and then start zooming out as you can see Everests monumentality quickly disappears against Earths planetary gynormosity compared to Earths diameter Everest in fact in fact all of Earths ruggedness barely registers now that can seem surprising since were often surrounded by diagrams and maps and globes that exaggerate Earths topography now theres a good reason to do that but it leads to a misconception about just how smooth Earth is heres a typical example a crosssection of the United States that I found on Reddit the vertical axis spans about ten thousand feet but the horizontal axis represents nearly 14 million so stretched to the same scale so as to mirror reality the actual smoothness of the earth becomes apparent on this one foot diameter Globe Everest is a bump about two millimeters High feels good but if the Earth was actually this small Everest would be a bump only a fifth of a millimeter high its ten times taller than it should be only 24 people have seen the Earth with their own eyes as a circle small enough to be looked right at not as the whole world but as a little thing suspended alone in space further away you are from a ball the more of its surface you can see now we dont always notice this because in our daytoday lives most of the balls we deal with are so small theyre almost always many of their own radii away from us and the available amount of their surface visible is near a maximum or theyre so big like the Earth that we rarely get far enough away fast enough to notice this property but the next time youre near a ball get close to it youll see that as you get nearer more of its surface disappears behind the Horizon but moving back up will make it available again for most of us stuck our whole lives on Earths surface such an experience is impossible with nothing around to block your review five kilometers about three miles is about the furthest you can see now Haze can limit your view and Atmospheric refraction can slightly extend it but for the most part everything you can see happens within an area of just 80 square kilometers thats not bad but its tiny compared with what there is to see the higher up you go of course the further away youll be able to see thats why its great to be a satellite heres the International Space Station yeah look at that nice big portion of the surface in view unfortunately this isnt a scale if the Earth were the size of an apple how far away would the International Space Station orbit like this far away maybe this far away or maybe this far away actually it orbits here 27 millimeters above the surface thats how far the stem of this apple sticks up thats not very far oh heres another fun little two scale fact if the Earth were the size of an apple your eyeball would be about the size of the Moon we often imagine that from the International Space Station astronauts see the Earth like this but theyre just not that far away from where they actually orbit International Space Station residents only see about three percent of Earths surface at any one time and that three percent is too wide to all fit within a window when I was in Pittsburgh their Science Museum had a mockup of part of the ISS and as you can see out of the window Earth is still quite expansive using special lenses images can be taken from the ISS that look like circular disc Earths But the lens is distorting things here its fitting much more into the picture in order to truly witness Earths entire shape with your own eyes you would need to either smash your face right up against a window or just be floating outside the station and even then you would have to move your head to Sea from edge to edge so how high up do you have to go to see the edges of Earth all at once and even if you did that how much would you actually see how much is there to see earth is made of stuff lots of stuff water and dirt and rocks and air all of which are composed of atoms tiny things so teeny that a single drop of water contains not a million atoms not a billion atoms or a trillion or a quadrillion or a quintillion but five sextillion atoms earth is made of even more stuff not a septillion atoms not an octillion nonalien decillion undicilian duodacillian treticilian not even a quatero decillion but 100 Quin decillion atoms but since we live only on the surface of our planet we unfortunately cant see most of those atoms if the Earth was shaped like a disc or an icosahedron or say a cube or a rectangular prism or two stellated rhombic dodecahedrins we could see more of the earth than we normally can but as things are we actually see nearly the least of Earths matter possible because of all solids a sphere which the Earth approximately is has the smallest surface area to volume ratio the most stuff inside and the least stuff outside so how many of these 10 to the 50 atoms that make up Earth are on the surface for us to see thats not an easy question for one thing technically atoms on the surfaces of opaque things like rocks and dirt arent the only Parts involved in their appearances subsurface scattering can and does happen regardless attempting even a rough approximation is Illuminating I asked Grant from the YouTube channel three blue one brown for some help and he pointed out that if you calculate the number of circles with atomsized radii that could pack optimally cover a sphere with the surface area of Earth you get about 15 times 10 to to the 34th thats a lot of atoms but then he pointed out that the Earths surface isnt smooth its roughness provides extra surface area for atoms to occupy without a complete description of the shape of Earths surface Every Mountain and Valley every bump on every rock this is just going to be hopeless right no heres the thing that from far away make big rugged shapes in other words Earths surface can be described as a fractal there is a regularity to its roughness in fact mathematicians have even assigned a fractal Dimension to Earths surface 23 now to see what that means I highly recommend Grants video on fractal Dimensions its fascinating using 23 and assuming that it applies from the scale of a human hair up to that of a mountain Grant found that the number of atoms on Earths surface changes significantly up from a power of 34 to a power of 37 thats a thousand times more atoms so maybe we shouldnt count Earths roughness out just yet its smooth but not perfectly to put that number in perspective the human body contains about 10 to the 27 atoms thats 10 powers of 10 less than the surface of the Earth 10 powers of 10 is 10 billion there are about seven and a half billion humans so more or less it can be said that there are the same number of atoms in every human body right now as there are on the surface of the Earth as Ive shown before all human bodies piled into one place would barely even fill the Grand Canyon but all human atoms spread across the Earth would almost perfectly cover it just one atom deep fun fact the mass of the atmosphere is about 25 percent less than what you would get by multiplying sea level pressure 147 pounds per square inch by the surface area of the Earth because Earths terrain displaces about that much air earths surface is pretty cool obviously I mean its got lichen and monster trucks and an island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island but from down here on its surface we just cant see that much of it your view of Earth is obstructed by lots of opaque things walls buildings trees rocks terrain if Earth was flat you could see further but sorry its a rough world out there or is it if you could hold the Earth in your hands like this how bumpy would it actually feel we already saw that even our planets biggest bumps barely register relative to Earths size but lets go somewhere famously flat where relative to our size terrain rarely gets in the way of seeing lots of the planet the US state of Kansas I grew up here and took this footage while driving across the state last year you can probably see why Kansas is often called flatter than a pancake however although it is famously flat Kansas is not the flattest US state in a fantastic piece of research Jerome Dobson and Joshua Campbell defined looks flat like this if from a given point any part of the terrain within the Horizon Rises more than 032 degrees up about the height of a 30 meter Hill at the Horizon a typical person would say well hey that parts not flat by cleverly applying this rule to topographical data they were able to give every state a flatness score West Virginia was the least flat Kansas was only the seventh flattest Delaware Minnesota Louisiana North Dakota and Illinois are all by this method flatter than Kansas as was the number one flattest state Florida Adam Savage and I had the pleasure of visiting Florida with our brain candy live show this year and as this footage from Atop The King Center in Melbourne Florida shows its pretty gosh dang flat now even though Kansas is not the flattest it is the state most often ranked flattest when the general population is asked it is truly scientifically flatter than a pancake its been demonstrated but theres more to the story than that in 2003 researchers took a 130 millimeter wide pancake procured from IHOP and analyzed its local reliefs they found the difference between high and low points was on the order of about two millimeters if a typical pancake like this was the size of Kansas 5 million times larger two millimeter high peaks would be 10 kilometer high mountains in comparison Mount Everest is only about 88 kilometers tall and Earths deepest Scar the Marianas Trench is thought to be just under 11 kilometers deep so not only is Kansas about as smooth as a pancake but so is every other state in the Union and so is the entire world if you were a giant holding the planet in your hands like this you and it would be torn apart by the immense title forces created by your gravities if somehow you could avoid that though the planet would feel not much rougher than running your hands over a pancake but a soggy one right I mean most of Earths surface is covered in water your hands would get wet or would they yes Earth is covered in liquid but the depth of that liquid like the mountains above just doesnt compare to the total size of the planet as it turns out if the Earth was the size of a typical classroom Globe like this one one foot in diameter the volume of water contained in above and on it would only be about 14 milliliters thats this much water its kind of hard to believe because at this scale spreading this much water across all of the oceans surfaces would be pretty much impossible due to surface tension but this is it all of Earths water compared to all of Earth ninety percent of the space on our planet life can live in is in here the other 10 percent is dry land so no you wouldnt get wrinkly fingers playing with an earth like this you could stop it dry just with a paper towel despite the incredible area oceans cover on our planet their depth is just nothing compared to the size of our entire planet now you may have heard it said that if the entire planet were shrunk down to the size of a billiard ball it would be smoother than a billiard ball after all weve seen so far that seems believable but as it turns out its not true the misconception stems from the interpretation of the world pool billiard associations rules now according to them a ball must have a diameter of 225 inches plus or minus five thousandths of an inch now some Riders have taken this to mean that pits and bumps of five thousandths of an inch are allowed proportionately on Earth that would mean a mountain that was 28 kilometers high so since Earth has none of those Earth must be smoother than a billiard ball except if bumps that high were actually allowed on a pool ball a ball covered with 120 grit sandpaper would be within regulation clearly the five thousandths rule is more about roundness deviation from a sphere and not texture in fact as microscopic photography has shown imperfections on regulation balls are only one 100 000 of an inch or about half a micrometer deep and high scale down to the size of a billiard ball Earths marionist trench would be 49 micrometers deep so Earth is smoother than a pancake but not smoother than a billiard ball nor as XKCD wonderfully showed is Earth smoother than a bowling ball but hold on earlier we were using the word flat now were using the word smooth that distinction is important you see the Earth isnt flat like a plane instead it curves its a ball pieces of earth like Kansas might be quite smooth but they curve along with Earth if you were to stand in the middle of Kansas people on the Eastern or Western edges of the state would appear to be not level with you but about 81 kilometers below you thats nearly the height of Everest and if they stood straight up theyd be tilted nearly two degrees relative to where you thought up was now heres an interesting coincidence generally speaking one mile from where you are Earth curves down about eight inches one kilometer from where you stand it curves down about eight centimeters now the rate of drop due to curvature isnt a linear one you cant just multiply any Distance by eight to get the drop due to curvature instead use an online calculator like the one Ive linked down in this videos description you can put in any distance you want anyway the visibility limit caused by Earths curvature is your horizon it encircles you like a visual cage but its a cage whose radius is determined by how high up your eyes are Conan OBrien at six foot four inches tall can see up to five kilometers in any direction but Snooki at four foot eight can only see about 43 to find out how far away your horizon is geometrically just use the online tools Ive put down in the description below Earths texture can get in the way of your horizon but can also cause things Beyond the Horizon to peek into view hey whats thatcom factors all of this in now if Earth was a smooth sphere the view from atop Ben Nevis the highest mountain in the British Isles would end at the Horizon 131 kilometers away about 80 miles such an area would look like this but factoring in Earths ups and downs heres a more precise boundary of what you can see lot tregg Scottish Gaelic for Lake of death is only about 10 miles from the peak thats within an 80 mile radius but it cant be seen because Terrain in the way blocks it parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea eight times further away can be seen they lie at the limit of Earths curvature just before it bends the surface out of sight these spikes extending beyond the geometric Horizon are caused by things Beyond it that are tall enough to Peak above Earths curvature in the case of Ben Nevis this includes high elevation parts of Northern Ireland okay enough about the surface and what its like close up lets go further away and see more this will be fun but there will be a tradeoff the further away you are from something the smaller it will appear to be moving away from Earth will make more area available to sea but that area will take up less of your field of view it can be difficult to illustrate this in a YouTube video because your field of view the shape and size of what you can see with your head still just by moving your eyes around is about 120 degrees up and down and more than 180 degrees horizontal a screen is just a window of that space nowhere close to filling it unless you get uncomfortably close to help us visualize large apparent sizes lets replace the spherical Earth with a flat disc thats always the same distance from The Observer this disc can be given an apparent size equal to Earths from any altitude and the disc can contain on it everything that would fit within your horizons from any altitude okay so standing on the surface looking straight down Earth will take up nearly a full 180 degrees of your field of view with your arms extended straight out parallel to Earth your fingers will point to the edges of the planet Your Horizon from 400 kilometers up about where the ISS orbits three percent of the earths surface is within your horizon but the Earth will only take up about 140 degrees of your vision your fingers would point to Earths edges if you narrowed your arms angles each by the width of two outstretched fists one fist is about 10 degrees across at arms length now you can move your eyes from edge to edge horizontally here but you cant quite take in the full width vertically but for more than twice this altitude 1 000 kilometers away Earth is only 120 degrees across thats one less fist width each this is perfect that fits within our narrower vertical field of view so from a thousand kilometers up about 620 miles you can just start to see Earth as a complete disk right in front of you at once however only seven percent of Earth fits within the Horizon from up here s a birth taken by satellites this far up like the tsunami NPP look kind of weird I mean North America doesnt actually take up this much of the globe Earths 120 degree width has been compressed to fit in an image much narrower compare Africa from its height to the famous Blue Marble picture taken from 45 000 kilometers away the latter looks more realistic like looking at a globe on your desk geosynchronous satellites are about 35 000 kilometers high from their altitude 434 percent nearly a whole half of earths surface is visible but the Earth only takes up a meager 17 degrees you could completely cover it with two outstretched Palms thats incredible but what about from the Moon well from that far away Earth is only about two degrees across you could block it out with your outstretched thumb however you can see more of Earth you can see further around its curvature from the Moon 49 of earths surface is visible just 49 if you want to see 50 half of Earths surface at once you have to go even further away in fact you have to go infinitely far away which you cant the most of a sphere you can see at once with your own eyes is just half but in the real world way before you were actually infinitely far away the amount of light reaching you from Earths surface would become so small and infrequent that you wouldnt be able to see anything at all stars like our sun are much brighter and bigger than the earth but only a handful have even with our best technology been resolved as anything larger than just a single point from one thousandth of a light year away our own Sun would look like every other star in the sky a single point to the naked eye only about as wide as R doradis the widest star in our sky from 91 light years away the point of our son would dim to a level undetectable by the naked eye it would disappear most of the stars in the night sky you can see with your naked eye are further away than that we can see them though because theyre brighter and bigger than our own sun which means if theres life out there living in systems around the Stars weve marveled at and written stories about since Humanity began chances are we are not part of their constellations or folklore were a dark patch in the sky to them an ignorable emptiness framing other stars the ones they Marvel at while not knowing were here or that theres anything here and as always thanks for watching Music if you dont follow me on Twitter or Instagram you are missing out on a treasure Trove of Premium content so check that out and know this I love you oh and this Vsauce shirt is only available to curiosity box subscribers this shirt comes in the latest box if you sign up now you will get this shirt so long as you sign up before it sells out the Curiosity box is good for all brains it comes to your door four times a year full of science gear and toys that I want you to have I want you to hold and learn from also a portion of the proceeds from every box goes to alzheimers research Im incredibly proud of it but whats going on on this shirt well its modular multiplication around a circle we have the numbers 1 to 40 around the outside of a circle connected to their product with the number four so one is connected to four two is connected to eight three is connected to twelve and so on even past 40 you can keep Imagining the numbers continuing for instance one can become 41 2 can become 42 and this emerges the Vsauce V many other shapes can be made by using different multipliers or different numbers around the circle mathologer has a fantastic video on this topic which you should check out Ive linked it down in the description thank you for being curious and as always thanks for watching,148.54808296668762,proportionately,0.0,1.0,mxhxL1LzKww,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxhxL1LzKww
Vsauce Live Stream!,2017-06-18T20:46:17Z,98.21666666666667,1767063,0,Music Applause Music hey Vsauce Michael Cameron Jake here and we are very glad that you are here whats going on well its our very first Vsauce YouTube livestream they said it couldnt be done but actually the technology has been possible for years and now youve jumped on and were going to be answering questions today were going to be showing you the inner contents of our brains and our minds ask questions over Twitter send them to at tweet sauce at Vsauce 2 at vsauce3 numeral 2  3 theres ly unknown description for those oh yeah yeah perfect easy and then also Kevin is not normally this flat he is joining us from Pennsylvania he it just is that dedicated and and were also going to be unboxing the latest curiosity box which is amazing its full of science were going to be doing some of those experiments but first things first the most asked question Im just going to get to it because the the most asked question is why has Michael forsaken us wheres a video wins the new video coming well if youre watching this live stream right now youre gonna get it youre gonna get a sneak peek and youre gonna get some for one one as the kids say so Ive been obviously doing the brain candy tour taking science and Vsauce all around the country weve got more of that coming and while I was doing that I was working on a whole series Im going to do about should I say say dimensions space the nature of space and the nature of how little or much of it we live in the first episode is about Earth were all familiar with Earth and Ive been doing a lot of calculations research and Im working with Eric are brilliant visual effects guy on some really cool things I wanted to show you but we couldnt make that work especially because the computer so far away I cant even reach to play anything so youll have to just youll just have to wait I my hope is that it comes out during VidCon Ive also got a really exciting dong episode coming out then and you know I appreciate everyones patience I am doing dong episodes really frequently but the Vsauce one episodes are like my passion on a plate its what Ive been obsessed with its what Ive just read 12 books about and I think its worth it I think the tackling subjects even if it takes a while takes a lot of talking with experts to make sure everythings right and everythings kind of novel and its not just hey I googled this and heres what Wikipedia said I think thats worth it but that said weve got the dawn channel thats full of content and I dont want to say too much else about the series thats coming but you know how I did like a lot of videos about infinity for a while well just you wait I I cant even tell you what Im doing this summer but I really hope its going to open my mind to things that have never been seen shown or felt thats all I can say youre also probably wondering what this box is in front of me Im gonna get to this before I actually get to questions this was made by a great guy named Mitchell he gave it to me at brain candy and its a jackinthebox but what could be inside of it well Ill just turn this some musics playing but its kind of quiet you might not be able to hear it oh it just popped open but but Im kind of hes got oh hey its Michael the jackinthebox how beautiful is that have you seen this Kevin yeah I think theres kind of a story of my life but lets start with some questions the first one I want to get to came from Twitter even before the livestream started and the question was ooh lets just lets just dive into what what would our channels taste like if they were actually so you can you can heres what Id like to do Id like us to say what sauce our channel is thats like a real sauce okay so if there had to be a condom if it already exists that was renamed Vsauce one Vsauce 2 and vsauce3 but would it be who wants to start because I didnt prepare an answer I mean Ill go for it Ill start and I hope Im not stealing anyones sauce I would go with a nice hollandaise sauce tell me why its its rich and creamy and satisfying but also probably not very good for you to have a lot of but yeah I just really like I dont know holidays was the first thing that came to my mind cuz it seemed like a little bit of a more of an obscure one because no ones ever just like boy I want some hollandaise sauce right now yeah you dont really dip stuff in hollandaise you cover things yeah hollandaise the question came from super Dec 64 by the way Declan Murphy thanks for the question Kevin what sauce in the real world is Vsauce  well sour I like to kind of like hopeful messages with like a little bit of sadness so I think you get the sweet and you get the sour so I think these sauce  kind of covers those two elements of the human experience I like that taste experience really I like that a lot because I think that sweet and sour sauce is a dipping sauce you can do things in it but you could also marinate things in it so its both exciting for a second and exciting to live in okay Vsauce one Im Im gonna say brown sauce good old HP brown sauce its more common in the UK and the Commonwealth but its basically people will say Im not describing it well but its like a ketchup with a whole lot more vinegar and its brown so its like this very adult kind of tastes like it kind of tastes like maybe an old man might I dont know but also its very serious but its fun whenever I see that theres brown sauce around I get very excited I eat too much and I hope thats helped feel about Vsauce theyre excited when things happen and then they overboard and they but they dont regret it alright thank you for that question Declan Murphy it is just ten minutes into the live stream which means its time for us to take out the first item from the Curiosity box this has been going on for almost a year yeah itll be a year but next month tell us Jake about what the Curiosity box is so the Curiosity box is something that weve been working on for a really long time and its a quarterly subscription box filled with science experiments science toys books tshirts stickers just fun things that we all really like and whats really cool about it is that everything in here besides the book was was created by us thats right yeah yeah as soon as we start writing books like the four books a year that itll only be our books but these los videos are great and I think Ill probably make them for my entire life but theyre only auditory and visual this is tactile and its even smell smellovision sometimes you can get all your other senses wrapped around science yes so take that passive experience which is video watching it makes it something that you can share with others visit exactly so what I want to do is look at just one of the items first or a tshirt that came in the box that you can currently get at curiosity box comm it is a mathematical tshirt its my favourite of all they talked about it yeah lets lets knife this open this is the safest way to do it this is literally how the box arrives at your doorstep its its heavy yeah and it has things cool you probably cant see it with it cool question works on the tape and thats one thing we should mention is that a portion of the proceeds from every box goes to alternative research thats right yeah weve worked with the Alzheimers Alzheimers charities for a long time and man how how cool is that been like and how perfect is it for the Box like the box is all about brain health your brain elf were giving you stimulation thats super smart and it inspires you to explore but also all the money goes not just to Alzheimers charities but the Alzheimers research specifically all right here we go Im going to cut this seal off and I additional math earlier by the next box we should be at a hundred thousand dollars donated thats amazing yeah thats amazing thank you guys for supporting the curiosity box and its you know cause to both put signs in peoples hands and also help Alzheimers research its not just about people who are at risk or or currently have Alzheimers its gonna help us learn all about all of our brains here comes the opening of the box Ill open it so that you can pretend it its Im opening it look at that its an octopus named ink which is short for Kevin it is not short for Kevin it strikes you short for inquisitive inquisitive theres a small version of them yeah so cute it actually came in a previous box too yeah okay so what is this right on top curiosity magazine thats right we write articles and things that we find really cool that youre not ever gonna find in a video like Kevin wrote about the fake rubber you chew if you want to steal this screenshot now and thats what you get okay Jake open the tshirt for me all right heres the tshirt box and one cool thing with these boxes that there was an image its gonna change actually for the next one but when this current one theres an image on every side that makes a larger image in total but heres the shirt lets open it up Wow mathematical so whats going on here Michael what are we looking at well let me hold it and see if I can bring it closer to the camera thickness Emery Im actually wearing it ah Kevins wearing the shirt there you go what a great fit oh my gosh Vsauce makes the best teacher Egyptian cotton Wow does does the tag literally say Vsauce and actually there is no scratchy tag Wow we must be experts so this this tshirt isnt just a fun design that makes the Vsauce V it is an example of whats called a modular times table weve got numbers 1 through 40 around a circle clockwise and then each number is connected by a straight line to what it is times 4 so the number 1 is connected to 4 the number 2 is connected to 8 theres a line between 3 and 12 and so on and this can continue as long as you want if you get all the way up to 40 you can just start pretending that the number 1 is 41 and draw a new line we didnt need that many but amazingly cool shapes come out of this and Kevin and I played around like for half a day trying to find one that kind of looked like vsauce logo and we found that 1 through 40 on a circle using the 4 times table looks like a V and Vsauce and thats in yellow here and does this glow in the dark oh it doesnt glow in the dark but future sure its might so anyway what I love about it is that its not just coollooking and look at the cool logo but when people ask you what its about you have an opportunity to teach them the wonders of modular multiplication like thats a slam dunk that is okay so any other comments about shirts you can can you just yeah lets just zoom in on the guy wearing the shirt for a second oh good looking thats Jake is in the magazine a lot a lot of me yeah theres a lot of theres a lot of cute fashion shots of us a few if you like that kind of thing and yeah Kevins right the explanation is in the magazine so what we love about the box is that its not just physics toys and tools and stuff but you actually get what we think is a better explanation of the items then you can get anywhere else or even if you searched online for a long time also I wanted to say that Im gonna be describing the math behind the shirt in my next video which like I said will be coming out at the end of next week while Im at VidCon very excited for that one and I cant wait and its pretty part of a series Ive actually written two episodes already in the series so once once the once the first script is like where I want it to be then I can film both and the second one involves mirrors you may say how a mirror is related to how much of Earth you can see at once well stay tuned yeah I cant wait all right now were gonna get to other things in the box but the next thing I wanted to do is challenge you guys to some lateral thinking puzzles and remember all of you out watching submit questions you want us to answer on Twitter at tweet sauce at vsauce3 numeral three at Vsauce to numeral two and well get to those after this but I was looking through my bookshelf this morning and I found this book that I have not opened since I was in Middle School and its full of riddles that require you to think laterally okay its not like you have to do a bunch of math to figure it out you have to dive down or up you just have to dive out and figure out what could really be meant by the puzzle all right no I really have not opened this since I got it so Im just gonna randomly find one okay a man sat perfectly still for eighty eight hours why hmm a man sat perfectly still for eighty eight hours why lets see how many days is eighty eight hours its its like not even theres an integer number of days three hours is seventytwo so yeah then its an additional 16 are they all in a row it sounds like theyre in a row so hes sat still for eighty eight hours because theres eight eight hours straight yeah oh it does say straight let me make sure no it doesnt separately still for eighty eight hours oh yeah so he it could not be in a row so it could have just been over the course of a week or so he said still for that many hours yeah but why perfectly still like whats the is that a clue its not just still but perfectly still maybe hes dead thats what I was thinking but then I dont know how long the embalming crosses when youre laying down well right if he died and no one found his body for eighty eight hours then he was perfectly still for that time that he was discovered and moved yeah Kevin do you have a guess well how long does that take and also are you trying are you perfectly still it takes three days it takes three days so eighty eight hours might be in the right realm of how long it takes to get to the moon but Ive seen Apollo 13 they float around they listen to music they do streams with President Nixon yeah hes still doing the stream still reason yeah they still they still well do you think I should look up the answer I mean let me look on Twitter to see if anyone else has some fun than answers the riddle by the way is a man sat perfectly still for eighty eight hours why okay now why I got 48 additional industry rigor mortis yeah and I think that fits along with the he died and wasnt discovered for he sat there because he had a dentist appointment for eight hours each week for eleven weeks I think that could be a good approach like its just that weve added up him attending you know an MRI appointment or he could be a street performer you know those guys that like stay in perfectly yeah on the street theres a statue but this book was written like in the early 90s so I dont know where street performers who froze like popular then I just didnt go out on the streets back in the early 90s because I was just a kid okay theres heres the answer the answer is chapter four eleven now the answer is oh my gosh you ready mmmhmm the man had a nasty toothache and he went to the dentist its at 500 pm on a Friday evening the dentists assistance including the Ennis anesthesiologist had all gone and the dentist could not administer an anesthetic the man insisted that the dentist should operate even without anesthetic so the dentist said that he would have to strap the man into the chair this was done the dentist then suffered a heart attack and died the poor man was left strapped in the chair and unable to move it was a holiday weekend and no staff reported for work until 900 am on the following Tuesday morning eighty eight hours later and just one Im getting some tweets that the audio is out of sync is it out of sync Eric Eric Eric is is listening watching the live stream yeah and then hes gonna look up we could see what the delay is never again sound canceling headphones on so he cant hear us but hell hear us in the live stream talking to him he still hasnt heard he doesnt know thats crazy so but while we wait to this Ive gotten a lot of questions about this shipping international oh yeah it does you if you go to the curio box website theres a little dropdown menu on the right it should show a flag and you can just choose what country are sorry yes sir yes its not see what oh how do we fix that we put me down okay so we just heard from Eric that its his fault he purposefully made the audio out of sync and I think what we should do is just keep it the way else that is it its a couple seconds sauce I think that season I mean were already 20 minutes into it so I say we just get to the next item and by the way this stream is very exclusive like this is Im gonna live on Vsauce 1 forever so yeah I think its a I think just deal with the audio being out of sync and know that you still saw something very very special because I have a fear which is that Im scared that if I cancel the stream has started again that it will just go away forever exactly yeah the great want page youll have to go to a new link yeah okay so we can invest what we do is there if you want to investigate and see if we can okay investigate Jake do you want open the next box item yeah by the way before we do that though I wanted to take a selfie of us doing the stream thats how all good streams start great okay now go ahead and open it and talk about it Im gonna tweet that out okay so what do we have next and currently this is the one that is currently shipping so if you want to order it youll get this very box oh okay were gonna go to one of the experiments first so in this box it comes with inks glowinthedark wonderful world of slime kit and it comes with two slimes green and blue they can make yourself you can create your own nonnewtonian fluid which is pretty awesome and Ive already made one just for this very purpose to show off and we cant really show off the glowinthedark function right now maybe lets see if we can I have a black light but its too bright in here so its not really lets see if we can pull up I got that lets lets maybe if they get really close and put it in the shade hmm not really Im really but it looks cool give it a poke while youre up close okay like an ASMR video look stripping well its only my laptop that literally it might the script for my next video is on containers so you can keep it and just make yeah make some slime and play with it so thats one of the experiments its really cool theres a little Kevin back there playing with it yeah the box isnt like this isnt someone elses slime this is packaged glasses way of sauce sly if you open it actually Michael if you want to open it it comes with a whole entire guide about different kinds of slime snail slime and yuccas what nonnewtonian fluid is what a Newtonian fluid is kind of goes through the whole thing oh there yeah so this is the booklet that comes in the box and like I said its not just hey kitchen science slime isnt slime cool its how would be sauce do kitchen signs in your home well we would provide you with a giant book evil of what slime is scientifically how animals use it what it is that youve created what glowinthedark means its really really cool nonnewtonian fluids the whole thing about that we got a picture of Isaac Newton in there this is a Vsauce video in your hands for a good cause curiosity boxcom somebody even made Noah linning made an unofficial subreddit for the Curiosity box oh did he I love I love that but lets go to a question so this question actually chilly try just I have a question yeah go ahead boys yeah should we just try and because I think what we can do were all gonna problems on the ceiling I think if we just unscrew and start again it will be at the same watch page are you sure yeah so we could just lets just do that cuz I I dont want to the delay is probably annoying cuz theyre saying its five seconds and thats not very good oh its night well be back in probably 15 seconds maybe more like 30 No here I go so lets start again okay it is ready okay so now we should be back I believe okay hopefully that fix some of the audio problems and it is getting really hot in here this way to turn off the air conditioner so that the audio would be better and oh my gosh I should have gotten a sweat rag alright now this is a question Im curious to hear what you guys think because we we talk about science and YouTube a lot we talked about memes sometimes this came from the subreddit meme economy oh yeah and they asked with Norma fication an economic bubble happening so often with memes what is the best way to find stable longterm memes with good growth for those of you who arent followers of the meme economy let me explain that its basically a Nasdaq trading area for memes and jokes and they rate how fresh a meme is like if youve got a whole bunch of them ready to share are you gonna get a lot of likes on you know Facebook or reddit or Instagram or wherever you put them or is it already all an old meme are you gonna look like youre lame and they track the popularity of memes and I said Nasdaq but they call it Nasdaq obviously the question is whats a good way to find stable memes that are good to invest in that will always be funny or at least be funny for a long time and wont be and will the bubble wont burst meaning you know some company tweets the mean and it completely becomes not funny and subversive it theres still an audio delay which means I think theyre just going to be a delay yeah okay sorry so Kevin did you hear the question yeah exactly so the question is a mean will pop up and itll be funny for a while but then inevitably you know my mom shares it on Facebook and then a big company does and all of a sudden its not cool and subversive anymore I like go ahead and and so how do you what makes a meme more likely to be fresh for a long time and not burst I think it just has to be kind of withheld within a certain zone and not turn into training moment yeah no i 100 agree i think that elements that make something less likely to become mainstream like being way too niche or you know in a lot of cases its just if a meme is offensive its never going to be shared by companies its never going to become mainstream and i think thats been the story of human culture ever since it began you know like if something was too palatable to the masses it would lose its kind of like edge right its coolness so lets see are you guys seeing other questions coming in that you like thank you meme economy for that I should really do a whole video on that topic and Ive wanted to because there are all kinds of social theories about how long it takes for something to become lame and then come back like beards for instance beards were cool in old tiny days but then for like my dad a beard was ridiculous thats what old men had so so I grew up with the whole generation of adults that didnt have beards and so when I got a beard it was like yeah take that I have my own identity and and you know I think my kids will probably think that beards are for old people and theyll all love shaving so hey good longterm investment razor blades that you heard it here first any other questions you want to do oh heres a good one Gaga D asks do you say gif or Jif good question Kevin you answer first Ive always said give I didnt hear jiff until later until I kind of already made up my mind that it was gift so it wasnt really an instance where I was going to say you know all of a sudden switch it to two Jim plus I love making peanut butter guy Jeff is a peanut butter so Id like to keep that in the realm of peanut butter and gif in the realm of you know animated images um so I do know that the creator of the formats said is pronounced jiff print however I go with gif I mean obviously he created it but gift its unique its different jiff as Kevin planet has already taken and also if we do want to be honest about it it is graphical not drown out your ethical so its still the same obviously that doesnt mean that it has to be pronounced gift and not gift but for me gift is is what its most reasonable yeah you know what I pronounce it jiff all US gift sorry I pronounce it gif and its all for the same reasons I am a language description astiz correct is what people do not what some rulebook says that would be a language prescription estándar stand that the creator of the word says that it should be pronounced jiff because they had the whole like choosy developers choose jiff you know slogan but heres the thing it became so popular that the creator no longer owns it and thats a sign of huge success you can hear this from like I think George Lucas has talked about this in the Star Wars like it became bigger than his own personal thing and all of a sudden you realize that its not you anymore but its you and the fans and the viewers and if all your viewers are calling it a gift because Jeff is what I guess I dont know how it gift became more common but you just have to surrender and say societys chosen yeah I mean if everyone started calling vsauce vsauce i would be upset but i would understand that if that the common way to refer to us then thats the way it would be yeah Im gonna do one thing real quick you have to move this sister were all aware and we move the webcam off and this mess around with the computer and see if I can delay the video so it matches with the audio okay cool but Noahs just a pet peeve that I have I like problemsolving technology all right so so youll keep the camera pointed at us so they cant still be pointed at you make sure its like lined up so you get Kevin ah Oh Oh drama shot hows the note maybe a little bit uh I like that you like that bald head people will think that yeah theyre you dont keep that okay and let me play with the computer okay cool okay so for those of you who have just joined us the most asked question is when is Michael gonna make a video I hate him he has forsaken us and that couldnt be further from the truth I have done nothing but work on a new series that its like my infinity series but its going to be about dimensions and that next video the first video in that series should come out at the end of next week this week if you believe the Week starts on Sunday Im really excited about it and its taken an enormous amount of reading Ive actually written the first two videos thats why it took so long I just like got so obsessed with mirror images that I wrote a whole other video and then I was like ah but I should film Im also working on a project that I cannot tell you about until VidCon starts itll be announced there and thats what Ive actually been very busy with its why I went to London last week to interview an amazing person and were here to answer your questions send them over Twitter in fact Im gonna look at Twitter right now and answer the very first question that I see the very most recent are you guys ready this could be dangerous the newest question is the video was already delayed the audio came before the video not a question the first question is when did Vsauce start and why Vsauce turned 7 years old in April of this year 7 years Ive made hundreds of videos and Jake and Kevin you guys have also made hundreds of videos its almost crazy how deep that archive gets after seven years with like no Bray thats something a lot of people dont realize probably about us that were not like TV where we dont take some kind of break between seasons you know where we actually dont work at all not all TV shows are like that but as soon as I put a video out Im working on the next one but its worth it because every video is different and its always something that Im insanely passionate about it never feels old it never feels like a job and that can be tough like for my wife who is like why are you working and reading and Im like well because if I didnt have a channel I would be reading the same book right now but at least at least because I I have a youtube channel i can build a conversation about this book and show other people all the cool things that scientists and mathematicians are doing so that is very cool Kevin any questions coming in for you you want to answer now there was one that I think that you know we get a lot and thats you know just any general advice for people trying to start a YouTube channel and my advice is always to just do videos about stuff that youre interested in it doesnt make it feel like work you know what Michael was just saying is definitely truly whenever I havent been working on a video its always because Im really excited to see what it looks like when its done and it doesnt feel like a laborious activity at all so often I think that people get this stuff on this idea that they have to make videos that you know that they think other people like or something when its really like sort of a marriage between like what you want to see and you know obviously what what other people want to watch too but at the end of the day you know you really should just be talking about and working on video that is exciting for the process and the journey and building and not just like the end result the end result is kind of like a present at the end that you get to unwrap and it and enjoy for a day or so but you know for all of the time leading up to that its its gotta be fun and exciting yeah 100 agree I theres such a balance between making sure that people are happy that theyre you know getting videos that they want to watch that they expect from you but also you have to evolve yourself and keep challenging yourself because your audience also evolves theyre getting older theyre seeing things theyre getting used to things and if you keep doing the same thing all the time theyll eventually move on you need to grow up with your audience and sometimes that means you know changing up a format or you know I mean I used to do shorter videos now I do longer ones cuz I was like well this would be a lot more difficult Ill do it and I love a story about Pixar and how they they used that to motivate every movie they made you know they made like Toy Story and everyone was like thats cool but can you do like millions of creatures moving all at once and they were like screw it were gonna do a movie about ants you know and they did it like they they they literally chose that topic because it was something that people said they couldnt do and so thats why when someone tells me you cant show or help people visualize the fourth dimension and actually see a fourth perpendicular and Im like perfect thatll be an episode Im gonna do Im spilling too many secrets about all the work that Ive been doing and all the videos that are gonna be coming out soon but Im gonna reopen this box and Im gonna pull something else out of it what do you think I should look at next Jake the posters all right so heres some coasters and as you may have noticed were not using coasters today but thats because were gonna wait till we unbox them heres my glass of water these are glowing beverage LMS I love these because not only are they cool but there is shoutout to a video I did years ago so coasters protect your tables but these also fill your mind each coaster has a atomic symbol on it weve got vanadium weve got sulphur weve got the gold and still inside here we have cerium if you put these all together it of course spells Vsauce but whats really neat is that if you turn them on they light up can you see can you see it lighting up of it pull the tab out thats how fresh this is can you see is it lighting up check that out because its so bright in this room weve got extra lights on us that some of the glowing properties arent happening here the Skjold ones working I dont know if you can see but when you put a glass down on it boom it glows purple yeah so you can find your drink in the dark and you can also appreciate the periodic table you can spell the word Vsauce this came from my video about whats the most precious metal and actually when to the University of Nottingham and I did experiments with all four of these elements vanadium gold sulfur cerium it was it was sweet those guys are so great Brady Haran is amazing and I mean thanks to him for letting me work with all of them and do those experiments Jake is actually hes in the same room but hes working on the audio delay so can I save your bookmarks yes my laptop is the one were streaming from so youre gonna bookmark all tabs just call it like livestream save and then okay so from the LM mats haha get it elements elements Im gonna move on to the polymer spheres look at that packaging that is called a premium experience these spheres the tiny little beads theyre made of a polymer that absorbs water like insane it loves the hydrogen bonds that water molecules have and although theyre small Ill actually open this test tube up so you can see how small they are they absorb 300 times their weight in water so there they are teeny tiny little beads and earlier what we forgot to put some in water overnight but I put some in about an hour and a half ago inside one of our glasses this is one of the Curiosity box beakers and its full of little beads okay you can see that its down at the bottom there little tiny beads you fill this with water and they expand at 300 times their size this is what they look like after just an hour and a half that many became this they are full of water and the clear ones have the same refractive index as water so if you put them in water they become completely invisible plus you can dry these out and they go back to the small size and you can use them all over again you can also squish them if you want I think Ill talk about this beaker because its in my hand but beaker is one of the goals of mine is to make things that are both tulle their tools in two ways this one is a tool that helps you carry liquids but it also lets you measure things so rather than just telling you 50 milliliters 75 100 we also put down some comparison some funny unit of measurement so for example if you fill it halfway up to 150 milliliters the the mug actually tells you that this is the volume of blood in the human brain yes if you only want that much coffee you gotta get the Curiosity Box beaker okay so Jake were still streaming but what are you trying to close all the tabs Im trying to close all the tabs both sides is the one that were currently in oh I just cant pull it out cuz I cant find its so far I have about two hundred and three tabs open because like I said Ive been researching for two episodes and Ive got all the links open because a little to likely through the tabs like a book you know or like a notebook full of ideas I could see the tabs getting bigger so this look it easier okay do you think the problem is the number of tabs was causing issues with the bandwidth feels better yeah because whats gonna happen is its using a lot of your memory and also your CPU yeah yeah definitely so if we can close all these tabs and we should get more out of the encoding software alright so heres heres a question that I want to get to because I had an answer prepared and let me see who it came from because I want to give to the oh okay here were gonna do a question from dragon Becks urn Stuart it says on Twitter Stuart asks which video did you enjoy researching about and making the most and why Kevin probably the video that I did about dragons all the millions here war just because thats something that Ive always been interested in like even as a kid you know dragons are always part of fantasy video games you know Final Fantasy and and movies and once I got interested in like where the origins were of that symbol you know it just became kind of like a you know wormhole or rabbit hole that was really exciting to read about so there was another question on here not workflow and Ill just kind of tie that into this you know one of the things that I do often is if I have a topic like dragons Ill just search Amazon for every book that I can find okay has been written about dragons well in a scientific manner you know not just narratives right well I could just grab a pile on than just a show ya show pile of the books I Ive got a pile of books over there that are related to my next episode and the one after that yeah but its really fun to read a book and then look in the bibliography and see other books that they read in preparation for theirs and then read those and you wind up finding that a lot of these authors or friends theyve talked about things together or theyve inspired each other and theres no end to it but I think you can only make a good video when youre really wellversed on whats happening and thats why they episode sometimes take a while the delay is better now yeah well just because Im sorry were gonna interrupt for a second its just because of how many tabs we had open I was afraid of that when we started using my laptop but it was the one that was just already logged in to the Vsauce you see let me reset this up theres a closeup of Jakes hand its a good look in the hands any palm readers out there let us know we yep whats good to me you can tilt it down a little bit great okay hey welcome back okay cool so so we cant see ourselves anymore but thats because you wanna be able to look at the health of the stream and also okay so part of whats going to be happening is in my mind and this isnt factual but I just believe it to be true is that if we have the actual application open and running on screen that it might use extra resources or breath because itll be prioritized and its the one that so however now everything should be fine we just Eric and I just listen to the audio it sounds a lot better so let us know if its in safe now and now we know not to try a stream with 200 absolutely yes yes and I hope you saved all those tabs cuz otherwise I might be able make a video for another four months I did okay so Jake thank you for your a lot about very first Vsauce live stream ever Jake while you were gone we got a question from dragon bucks urn who asked what was your favorite video to research and why favorite video to research and why is a great question dragon okay think about it Im gonna answer that its not my next one but my next next one Ive been researching it since February thats how long its taken Ive had to build things Ive had to reach out to people who are much smarter than me and I just keep adding things to it and Im like well should I do an hourlong video should I make a do 17 days straight the visual effects work for it yes obviously yes to both of those questions and generally my answer that question is my favorite episode is the one Im working on right now because thats why Im working on it its a topic that I was like so curious about I wanted to dive into and I cant wait to understand it well enough to explain it thats how I feel you know you youve wrapped your head around something as well as you can appease when you can explain it to other people and your curiosity about the topic is contagious to them then youve done it you know but of course I wind up looking at old videos and now that Ive had like some time away from and I go ah theres a better way to have said that or theres a better way to explain that so I think youre gonna see a lot of kind of callbacks and a lot of clarifications in this new one Im actually investigating like literally the episode coming out in about a week Im gonna talk about a claim that I made in my earth is flat video that Kansa is flatter than a pancake Kansas is flatter than a pan well wait a second the reason Im correcting it is that more precisely Kansas is smoother than a pancake but Kansas is not flat because the earth isnt Kansas curves along with the earth and crazy enough this is gonna spoil one of the fit the facts from the video but thats why you guys are here youre the livestream people and you deserve the best so if you stood in the middle of Kansas people on the west and east side of the state would be 200 miles away in each direction and if you can see through the earth you would actually see them about eight kilometers below me thats almost the height of Everest its like one kilometer short so theyd also be like tilted at a two degree angle so Kansas is not entirely flat at all its curved and its curved such that its almost like standing on top of Everest if you could see people on the other sides if you could like see through the curvature of the earth it was transparent or something thats pretty neat okay so Jake what do we do next now that youve made the stream perfect whats happened whats whats whats thats good or answer another question all right so how would a Kansas pancake tastes well it would taste like a pancake because its literally just a really big nice one Nicholas Meredith how did we meet ah yeah so it was a OkCupid comm is how thats not true OkCupid comm by the way could have been how we met you know its been around for like 20 years apparently long as Ive been around yeah Jakes Jakes gonna be 24 this year were very excited for him hell be able to rent a car almost in New York yeah and and and how long do you guys think I am a lot of you probably know I mean I know Im not gonna say you you you you say first lets see if people on Twitter are giving us any guesses but I hope we meet well we all met blowing business it was a staggered story Michael met Kevin because others say your story and then you can fill the blanks Michael was doing YouTube stuff and Kevin was doing YouTube stuff and Michael saw it was like this is really cool and reached out the Kevin said hey Kevin you should do some videos for Vsauce because this is back when a sauce was more of a gaming comedy channel and there was multiple different hosts right let me clarify that Vsauce was a comedy channel problem is that wasnt very funny but Kevin was funny and I was like dude youre making funny videos like literally the burst was I was like can I give you money to put up one of your videos on Vsauce like literally it was a video you would already put on YouTube wasnt it yeah it was an episode of Julius blue yeah the first two videos that I did for Vsauce we just re up loads of videos that I did on my channel that you actually intro and then reupload it on Vsauce thats right how weird like I would never do that today but back then it was like there were even fewer you know rules and experiences and traditions and then Vsauce 2 started like the same year Vsauce one day because at the time it was a trend everyone had a second channel that was literally the numeral two after their name in retrospect I wish that Id called it you know Vsauce Green Vsauce blue Vsauce violent because then they would kind of stand on their own better and instead the number system makes it look like theres a hierarchy which there isnt but Vsauce 2 was where I could do stuff that wasnt comedy related but was a little more educational that wound up working a lot better because I was better at that than trying to be funny and also was hard to get access to like game footage and stuff because we werent IGN we werent some big company that everyone knew and then I think it just became obvious that having one person per channel and kind of leading it from an individuals personality worked way better theyre called channels but theyre not theyre really like shows and if you have a lot of different formats on one channel people get confused so I said Kevin why dont you just take the second channel and do whatever you want theyre like its just yours and then Kevin and I were going to lunch one day and we saw this homeless guy on the street and he said I really want I cant figure out what to tattoo on my finger we said well have we got the logo for you now Im just kidding tell tell tell your story uh Jake yeah thanks I was well I started working at Google in 2011 and Michael and Kevin were also at Google and we just kind of became friends and I was running a space focused channel at the time thats right space lab yeah Space Lab I was doing Space Lab and we always kind of became friends as we worked in the same office in New York and it just blossomed yeah we we should explain like wait you mean you worked at Google yeah we literally worked at YouTube the long the long story short is that when I first started making YouTube videos I was hired by a company called next new networks and I worked on a channel called barely political and then I created Vsauce and then YouTube literally acquired the company the next new networks and so I became a Google employee and they were really handsoff they just wanted someone on staff who knew how to help advise other creators to get the most out of YouTube to make the best content they could build audiences and I had a channel so I had experience and as Jake and Kevin join we became like three people who all had experience who were all literally walking the talk and that was really great Im you know goo so hands off like they didnt know what we were doing or win and they never told us what to do hey you know I mean they would they would have us help clients like they would say hey you know this person or this companys gonna do some Olympics videos could you help them make them like a little more exciting more or educational or surprising or you know whatever and so we were doing that for a long time and then it was just last year that we we all left and became independent so now yeah we have our own office that is a Vsauce office kevin has a home vsauce office and he looks on the other side of the country and you know after after that happened I moved back to the United States from London cuz I was I was working for Google in London so thats a really good question I think we could probably talk about that story forever mmhmm should really just write a book about it put that in the curiosity box all right a lot of questions coming in now should we do another item yeah yeah take the box Jake Im gonna look through some questions yeah do that one and while you talk about it answer this question from Sarah Nicole nine one two three who asked on Twitter how do you decide what goes in the curiosity boxes okay so that will lead into kind of this one so in every box we also have a steam game for Mac and PC so in this money its called dub words and dub or has actually had a very interesting way of getting into the box where I I do a lot of work with Taco Bell and they have like that they have a program where they help game developers indie game developers make their games and get out there and stuff like that so this is one of the games that was part of it and the people who made it were so nice and the game is so cool that we were like can we just feature it in the box so they gave it to us and let us put it in the box and its really cool and this one you basically its like a topdown shooter but it uses music as the weapon so its kind of fun and Im gonna scratch off the code and whoever wants it whoever gets it first can just get the game if you if youre the one who actually gets the game let us know because I always wonder who winds up winning these kind of events let me put that others down for the free games theres the code is it focused it looks like its in focus so theres the code and there goes some really cool indie developer game glad to help him out yeah like if you if you are the one person who got the code I would recommend you know if you really like a game write a good review on Steam because you know the better they do thats awesome thats great theyre a small company does to people and they made this entire game themselves over the course of years but so more like Michael we put stuff in the box in Kevin that we just find to be curious thats interesting to us there are things that weve liked in our lives or that we see like oh wow we need to make that we need to have that yeah and it takes a long time to like source and create the items that we need for the box so we have a whole list and its like months out before we actually have confirmed that we can get get it in I remember the gyroscope was one that I was like guys this is first of all like a classic physics toy we have to get one in the box and Ive always wanted to do a video about how gyroscopes stay up because I dont know why so okay its gonna come out when it came out in like the the holiday box from last year I was like great so around the holidays of 2016 I have to know how to explain gyroscopes in time because a lot of people in beginning them man it was so fun you know like I I had the the luck to grow up around science stuff around cool polymers around periodic table toys around gyroscopes around things with weird properties and I think it was great for my little tiny little Michael brain and the Curiosity boxes are a chance to like do that we already make videos and well keep making videos obviously but to get the science in your hands and connected with the videos thats one of the big goals of of the box Im just going to grab this sticker right word and big thing what like this ink plush probably took what maybe six month to actually make yeah oh and also hold that you plush up its about the same size as this one in the back I dont know if they can see it if you yeah but thats an optical illusion that her parents sizes are the same but let me go grab this big one and show you its actual size while I walk away check out the back of my shirt it was an easy question we can answer while Michaels doing that Kevin whats your favorite band this is from McDaniel on Twitter my favourite band right now is probably Paul Bearer which is a do metal band they just put out a new album called heartless thats really amazing but I also really love Gojira which is a French black metal band they came out with a new album last year called magma and if you guys earned a medal you should definitely check out their super talented and their lyrics are always really cool and kind of atmospheric and esoteric they talk about kind of like science stuff its less like Bohr and my evil things that a lot of tomato lyrics are our focused on so I dont know I think if if youre a pea sauce pan and into metal you definitely like what Europe for sure how did you get into metal do metal especially um Ive always liked metal I think my first cassette tape because I in that old was actually Motley Crue dr feelgood so I mean I was five years old now your your your wife is really into it did you get her into it or did you guys have that in common no we just had that in common so yeah but yeah Im always like Ive always liked Mel since literally I was a little kid so its not like something that I fell into when I was a teenager or anything like that its its its pretty much what Ive liked always yeah so my accent I love to Michael Jackson when I was like three yeah men by the age of five imma chilling to motley crue its a natural progression story is oldest Im Jake favorite band right now oh right now yeah not like well Im sorry just favorite band I dont mean to make it I went through my favorite band thats the most meaningful to me if such one is growing up is modest mouse yep like Interstate 8 moon and Erica that stuff like those albums especially those two particular are timeless to me wont some crowded West look like any which is really good but I think mood in America is one of my favorite albums on the planet I could listen to that endlessly its just so beautiful and and haunting and I just it reminds me of being in high school and like driving through the plains in Colorado right so this this shows how much hipper and younger I guess Jake is the me because Modest Mouses earlier albums remind me of being in college it was like thats all I listen to so I would say that thats my favorite band of my life right now Im listening to a lot of Angel Olson do you know her I think I found her feel her work with Cass McCombs and shes incredible and I also really love black moths super rainbow and tobacco same same guys behind both of those their music is so trippy its so great Ive even tweeted some playlists of songs I like and I always include either a tobacco song or a black Mouth super rainbow I saw them live I saw a video of them performing live at a radio station Ive never seen what they looked like Id never seen them play and I was like yeah I picked well this is awesome and one question weve been getting a lot on Twitter is people asking about why the curiosity box doesnt come their country ah so what you can do is if you go to the Curiosity Box website theres an email there and this email and request the the country because the basic ganas answer is that we have to create kind of shipping agreements with different countries so we can get it actually there and get it at a reasonable price and not an insane thing that has to go through customs so we just need to know that theres actually people who want there before we go through all the negotiation processes of getting it shipped there so email so we know that you want it there and then we can start actually making that happen yeah yeah exactly because our goal is for this to be available to everyone just like the videos that we make on YouTube you know we could we could like you know sell them to you on DVD but then we want to reach more people we want more people to catch the curiosity bug and fall in love with these topics its gonna be laserdisc only laserdisc only they still sell cassette tapes at CBS you know that yeah I think theyre used in medical equipment or something still anyway but but that that made me think of my favorite thing about making videos is that I can pick any topic like its almost a challenge to try to pick a topic that sounds the most like bizarre the brick ista crone problem was one of those like no one can even pronounce that why would you do a video on it do one about black holes everyone loves those and Im like everyones gonna love the geometry of cycloids they just need to like be introduced to it the way I was months ago and I want to do like a series that just tries to get more and more boring like the physics of how paint dries or how grass grows or I guess I did that minefield episode where I was in a white room for 72 hours thats about as boring and lacking in stimulation as you can get lets talk about this sticker because this shows a side of us they showing off at him cuz he can talk about it we can show it yeah Kevin talked about a sticker oh yeah so you know we wanted to put a sticker in a box that represented Vsauce in in a unique and kind of new way and you know what I thought was to come up with this this tree and it wasnt just any tree it was you know a nebula tree so instead of leaves you know its its its its gases in outer space and the roots themselves spell Vsauce so you know the nutrients and the water that gets absorbed into this cosmological tree thats good sauce you know thats kind of like the communicator of this like heavenly body yeah yeah it that doesnt sound crazy it sounds I dont cover up the website curiosity voxcom yeah put it there yeah I love it I love it also like we we worked for a long time on this to make sure it was it was the way we wanted it to be and because we can include tshirts and stickers and things you get to see is the kind of aesthetic side that we have that you might not always see in videos because those are more factbased you can actually I mean Jake your your content is so cinematic now that its almost like we do get both but mine are always terrible except for what Eric makes my little twodimensional Photoshop animations are like hey this is what was in my head and using only two dimensions and some rectangles heres what I think it is Dylan waffle says have you discontinued minefield I love minefield it has not been disken youd next week you might hear exactly what that means can you tell that Im winking but Im also for those of you who are just now joining dedicated my number one priority is Vsauce one videos the regular things that you guys come for and its been a while since my last one because Ive been writing scripts many of them I want to do this whole series about dimensions and spacetime is a dimension as well but I love the spatial ones because of the impossibility of imagining more than three or is it is it an impossibility tune in to Vsauce open to find out more subscribe sapphire asks I dont know if you guys are Doctor Who fans it was an easy question go ahead sapphire ask who is your favorite doctor my favorite doctor is David Tennant I think he was the best doctor and he is just so cool love him love Dave where was he in the order so he came after Eccleston okay so in the new series he was the he started the second season right and then I prayed with Matt Smith that means nothing to me Im not afraid to admit this but I have not gotten into Doctor Who yet oh its I know but tinit I should be looking out for their where do you start thats one of those theyre the thing you dont need to the way that the when the series was rebooted you dont like they do references to the original doctors and the original episodes but its more of like kind of Easter eggs like hey you know this because youre a big fan you can watch the new ones without that I think you need to start with Eccleston and then from Eccleston and he in my mind was the one that I kind of related to the most in his personality and of the way that he expressed himself and interact with others Kevin do you have a favorite doctor um Im more between Peaks guy do Twin Peaks if anybody out there is watching that its really weird yeah I cant wait I cant wait to get back into it so I wanna you dont need to watch the first the earlier episodes do you because really no I mean it would help if you spoke with someone like you could ask me for like a primer right I can give you in about 10 minutes well I wanna I want to watch the earlier ones and I tried to actually back when I lived in New York I bought a very discounted VHS tape collection of all the Twin Peaks episodes but they were labeled out of order so I watched them out of order is our connection bad it says bad thats more of really just the WiFi okay so so shadow kills three two one asks is this the next box coming in July or is it the previous the box were opening right now is the current one if you go to curiosity box calm and and subscribe now youll get everything thats in this box we havent even shown you everything yet but the box thats coming out next is dont listen were your ears my favorite I cant believe how awesome the next box is its like but thats also one of our goals like we care we have this opportunity to like lower the quality of the box thats never the point you guys know what our videos are like youve been watching for years its always about yes but how can I make this more difficult for myself and longer and better it needs to be a challenge it needs to be a challenge and so this one I think is the the best of any that have come out so far the next one is even better I mean there might be a day where we it went downhill a little bit but it all just be for a reason oh yeah itll be because it actually isnt the worst theres something you know what I mean so but this ones really I mean but the thing that should be noted is that the next one is incredible as of this one but to be able to get the next one like to make sure you get it you should probably start with this yes its locked in for the next one because we only make so many this isnt like made on demand so if we run out its sold out and that happened last year with the gyroscope 70 the last two box outs have in the last two boxes so we wind up with people subscribing they cant get the newest one we came up with a solution for that which is that if you subscribe and weve already run out of the currently shipping box you get whats called the best of box and its our favorite things from all the previous boxes you dont need things from the previous boxes they dont connect its not like you you know you shouldnt start midstream but you will get one right away and its gonna contain some of our favorites so if you want the next one the coolest I cant even tell you everything thats in it but Ive been working with but even the game the game is worth almost as much as the boxes yeah the game of the segment is literally huge literally what I see what you do in there I like it I like it yeah and its like I think its the first box that is the one is its taken us like a year to put it together were like I want this and I want this thing and I want something that looked that establishes this principle and allows people to experiment with this and it took us a year and it all lined up to be the next box and thats gonna keep happening for all the next and next and next ones and all through next year its gonna be years of preparation before you actually get the box mmhmm so lets go to the next item in here what should that be I think lets do that okay okay so we also have collectable items this one is a collectible enamel pin and its a ink or little octopus friend the mascot of curiosity box which before I get to the pen why an octopus well Ill tell you why and this im retconning here because this isnt exactly why it began but if if the curiosity box is the handson science version of these sauce videos the mascot should have a lot of hands now octopi dont have any hands but they do have a lot of arms eight of them in fact so he represents the like actually touching and holding things and experiencing them live in front of yourself which is you know miles better than just hearing an explanation anyway this pen has ink wearing a diving helmet and some floaties on two of his arms which by the way makes no sense because hes an octopus you should be able to breathe underwater but you never know what to expect thats why its the Curiosity Box gettin a lot of questions about the simulation theory that Elon Musk has been has been talking about a lot yeah and the reason I want to mention that we dont really go to in depth because is a little bit of a spoiler for what an upcoming vsauce3 video Im actually making a video on that topic with the YouTube channel in a nutshell so were gonna do a twopart series on that half of it obviously on the Curt cigar channel and then half of it on vsauce3 but that would be coming hopefully in August but yeah thats the topic of the video that were working on thatll be awesome but that question comes up a lot too so I cant wait and man working with in a nutshell what a great channel we actually did we put them in the magazine in the past or was that wind over that Im thinking about we put wind over yeah so the magazine that comes with the Curiosity box also shouts out some of our favorite educational channels yeah this one is let me just confirm yeah yeah with no reproductions and we also feature what an artist that we like and this it was kit McGrath who Kevin I both followed on Instagram independently and realized we both love them you probably following me now you probably found out later because you youre such a follower who kid more girl yeah yeah yeah so hes busy looking at questions while Im trying to rhythm but the point is that yeah we we use the magazine also has a chance to shout out what else you should be watching on YouTube Jakes got an article about film kevin has one about rubber I have one about numbers and number names and how how the first number alphabetically is 8 in English oh yeah the second number alphabetically do you guys know dont look no eight billion oh you know maybe your billion eight billion eight is the third Im gonna literally go through all the numbers alphabetically eight million 18 million eight billion 18 million eight youre okay youre dropping balls so I better stop okay can I open the last item in the box yeah open the last item so this one is really cool so this is why the box is so big in heavy because theres always a book in the box and this book is especially cool you actually getting a lot of questions out elements its the elements its a really cool heavy book and even has the covers actually custom printed for us and it has the Curiosity Box official logo on it and thats really cool its something Ive been doing in the future a little spoiler little tease if I may is that I believe the next book that comes with this box actually has a custom forward bias yes yes it does and in the book thats in the next one I grew up with and I loved and Ive never found anything like before this is what my dad used to have and you shouldve shown some of the pictures its video tells you about the element and then shows you how its applied and they try to show you is pure the sample yeah it gives you like atomic weight density atomic radius the crystal structure of the electron filling order all that stuff but this the photos are really really nice theres also a poster in the back of the book that is a periodic clay that I love I have and all these photos are on that poster that comes in the barn yes sir please put in the whip Eric hey so so Sadaharu 98 just said whoa whoa whoa its octopuses not octopi who said octopi I didnt say octopi did I yeah you did I said octopi all right well let me say again that Im a language description estai think that even if something is technically wrong if everyone understands what youre meaning then youre fine however I totally am on board with you in fact in the magazine that comes in the current box if you subscribe today or if you already do you have this theres actually an entire the very first pages from ink but it was written by me because spoiler alert ink is like a character and not a real thing but I wrote this and what and its its all about how youre right the plural of octopus is octopuses or octopodes activities theres the poster wow its a gift that just keeps on giving thats really cool so thats all of this lets just wrap up the box up real quick and we can do some more questions yeah theyre perfect perfect but thats the the latest curiosity box that you can currently get again curiosity voxcom its a great way not only to support vsauce but also to support alzheimers research yeah we are getting very close to that 100000 donation mark thats that really awesome yeah and its just a fun thing and all these items are in the in the latest box so you can get that and then it also puts you reserves you for the next box which is going to be amazingly even better than this one we think its its a massive yeah and Im doing so many videos around it that itll theyll probably sell out right away so you should subscribe now because youll be really sad otherwise we only make so many of them oh where did it end its your audience oh no one spill any secrets oh because this the softwares frozen this weed you minimized it okay yeah okay one second gang Im just gonna start was the last thing that I said oh no the audio is coming through thats fine okay look yeah the video stop but you guys can still hear us yeah so so it should be coming through again camera froze yeah okay health is good so I think it should be back it it looks like Kevin is dabbing in the freeze okay oh were still frozen on this thats the issue its the camera thats frozen yeah so lets just Johnny now its gonna work there we go lets go back to that nope okay so were just gonna have to go to our webcam youre just fine which ten there we go were not frozen we should be like wow look No hold that was like the the mannequin challenge yeah thats what were doing right now everyone arent we amazing at it and see this is oh there we go unfrozen maybe tilted a little bit yeah I dont actually the table Nick burns company computer guy okay all right now that so many things were back so so I dont know if everyone saw the book but we were talking about the box and how proceeds from the Box go to Alzheimers research weve raised almost a hundred thousand dollars for Alzheimers research because of this box Alzheimers is something that affected my grandfather and it was extremely extremely difficult so I flew out to Chicago and I worked with biologists and a chemist at the Alzheimers Association and they taught me all about what were doing where research can go what we can hope for in our lifetimes and Im so grateful to them I made an episode about it if you havent seen my episode on Alzheimers go check it out because I dont know if there are a lot of resources that really dive into the kind of biology and chemistry behind the disease and how its different from other kinds of dementia theres a lot of misconceptions out there and its really appearing as this like next thing as we make progress on heart disease and cancers Alzheimers and dementia is kind of there waiting for us its all beyond that natural selection shadow layer you didnt have to live to be 80 90 100 years old to reproduce and so natural selection didnt fix that its like really up to us so so so exciting to be working with Alzheimers charities on furthering research yeah the thing thats affected all that I remember like having to towards the end of my grandfathers life introduce myself to them every time did I go this is your grandson Jake any be like oh hello and where are you going to Skype in college I have to tell them every time Liberman to college and who I was and its not a fun thing so we want to try and help that as much as we can lets look at some questions now were taking questions over Twitter at tweet sauce at vsauce3 numeral three at vsauce2 numeral two a lot of good ones coming in shout them out if you find one that you were really excited again I think I might have just fixed that again Im trying here Im only one man no very small thing much much meat on me I also like to point out this tshirt I think is pretty cool is that like the Japanese the actual poster yeah the Japanese poster for Star Wars its kind of cool we should say Happy Fathers Day to all the fathers out there watching and happy Fathers Day to all of our fathers yeah because you know what up daddy if any of you were recording this you can use that for memes in the future yeah one question that I think is an easy one to answer we didnt get too indepth into it is uh whats your favorite video game favorite video game look on answer first because I know that least about video games I still love home world you remember that back the era I loved the slowness of it it was like playing chess with yourself because you had so much time and it was this 3d strategy game and I would I would play and then when I couldnt play anymore I would just go outside and ride my bike and talk out loud about strategies I might do it was like because back then you couldnt watch other people play video it were no Lets Plays there was no YouTube but I did exactly what people do today when I wasnt playing I was watching other people play or I was talking about the game yeah no great so Im just gonna jump in because homeworld was was buying see where its published by Sierra yeah Sierra also published my favorite game which was the original halflife yep developed by valve published by Sierra that game changed my life because our first time where games like cinematic it felt like you know you were experiencing the the theatrical moments in real time it wasnt a loading screen and then break and it feels like a cinematic prerendered thing is happening there and then all the modifications that you create for were excited I can make different skins for characters I can make different models I can make my own maps and then play out with them I met with my friends yeah that was really cool for me so halflife is my go to Kevin  it came called Xenogears which is for the PlayStation 1 its a its a roleplaying game and I just think it was the coolest story not only in video games but its one of the coolest stories that Ive ever encountered I mean it takes place across thousands of years and it involves science and philosophy and psychology and religion and just in capital encapsulate its kind of like all of what humanity is about and theres mix I mean it just kind of has everything and if I had an endless amount of money to dedicate towards remaking we definitely go towards an updated version of CEO gears because they they didnt even finish the story the second off lab is I mean you can read about this if you want to the second disc is just just sums up what was gonna happen with the story because they kind of ran out of time so its this weird thing where the game doesnt even really in the right way it has like a cliff notes second its its its weird but its amazing Im gonna talk about the Orange Box real fast not this orange box but our number was living in New York I had a weekend with nothing to do and I walked to a store and I bought the orange box and I played a game called portal Id heard about portal but I hadnt heard anything about it I play it I like oh this is kind of neat I also like that its not about working really quickly I like solving the puzzles but I had no idea what was coming in the end and I played that all game without leaving the couch all the way through all the way through the night and I was like what I got so scared it was it was an amazing experience that you cannot replicate with just a movie or a book ed portal so the thing that was such a surprised by that is that it wasnt really even one of the main selling points of the orange box you got like the new halflife chapter trapped like  you got Team Fortress 2 I think you also got the old games for halflife and then there was just this little thing called portal yeah oh this is gonna be a fun little like 30 minute diversion but it was incredible and the sequel was so much fun I remember playing that with my friends cuz you can do coop mode in portal 2 right now can I say that I had him just with one of those thanks to Eric everybody with me you guys later could you would you play with me because Ive never played portal 2 why because I played portal 1 on a Playstation and PlayStation 3 I think right it would have been yeah 33 yeah and I wasnt good at the controls I was like I just wish I could use a mouse yeah because I played World of Warcraft like crazy it actually kind of was almost a problem and I leveled up a lot of characters to the max and whatever but I got I really enjoyed having a mouse to look around so I want to play Portal 2 on a PC but I dont have the system at the moment to play it and I dont want to play it on a console because I dont think Im good at joysticks yeah it is it is more difficult for fur mouse and keyboard being able to yyeah than my little mouse there but theres also something for like the simplicity kind of a concept of Oh grab the controller sit down and some games are obviously that are designed for that than others is there like one or two more questions that we want to answer before um before we go yeah like one that I liked was um No do you think maths exists or is discovered thats a tough one Id like to do a video on it I think Roger pin roses book what does it called the road in reality touches on that the best but its a huge heavy thick book I believe I dont even know what to believe I think that we we invent a lot of stuff mathematically but then it happens to already exist in the universe and so its a combination of Hey look what I invented its called an imaginary number ah well its imaginary must not have any real existence and then a hundred years of years later we go it does what the heck its so useful and helpful so yeah I think its a combination of both also theres one dudes been tweeting on ours say thats your name and I apologize if I pronounced it Im a horrible human being thank you for showing your friends our videos thats very nice of you you are a very nice person you know what Im gonna give you a wing that was just for you thats yeah everyone close your eyes everyone out there dont watch your eyes keep your eyes open did you do it because I close my eyes  you didnt yeah everyone open their eyes okay great youre welcome arsh okay so when is the next vsauce video coming if youve just joined it should be coming in just about a week I really appreciate you guys as patience the episodes that we all make are you know theyre not cookie cutter things they require a lot of research and I have wrote written actually more than one episode so Ill be filming those really soon its all part of the series that I do we kind of like how we did a bunch of videos on infinity for a while but this ones going to be about space and the philosophy of dimensions but the first the first one is is like a quick introduction that kind of got me excited about things and its about how much of the earth can you see at once thats my next episode and I started to just you know I keep asking why and I never am happy with an answer I just want to say but why that but why that and a lot of my script was about how the further you get away from Earth the smaller it looks but I wasnt happy with just that I wanted to know why why did things appear to look smaller when you go further away and the answer is just a very simple geometric reason but I wasnt happy with just that I wanted to know why do we live in a universe where angles work that way and that took me to dimensions it took me to their independence their linear independence from what another and then all of a sudden it became what my next year these videos are going to be okay I just want another question yeah I think this is a pretty important one and this is for mr avatar and he says what do you think about pineapple on pizza Kevin you go first well you know I think its okay I dont have a problem with it per se would I ever order it explicitly I dont think so but um if I was very very hungry and there was pineapple pizza you know Im going for Michael I want to piggyback off of Kevin but youre taking can you guys see what Jakes doing with the balls the polymer balls with theyre overflowing because theyre filling up with so little water just these balls are what come in the current curiosity box if you subscribe at the website thats how many were in the mug before and thats what it looks like now and it doesnt ruin theyre not even done growing it takes like 12 hours from the foveal so cool they feel really cool they feel like probably eyeballs and you touched eyeball before Oh multiple times hold someones eye boy after I murder of people I just always take out their eyeballs and I like to eat them but what am Im a little bit like yeah Kanawa story is all this time so okay Im on a pineapple on pizza I think you know Kevin I think really encapsulated there the vsauce spirit you know I dont hate anything Im not full of hatred for for any kind of pizza topping i I might find it fascinating that some people have very strong opinions about pineapple on pizza I dont I dont eat pineapple on pizza I have I dont always like it but I think that its part of the experience of life and if you count it out youre not experiencing the universe in its totality so I have a much more abbreviated answer which is I love pineapple I think its delicious pineapple is one of my favorite fruits on the planet Ill have pineapple anything so yeah kind of on pizza I also just like normal pizza and thats thats that I hear something yeah I do this this is a nice question Pablo asks what advice would you give someone who wants to make educational videos but are afraid to fail ah Ill step one dont be afraid to fail yeah thats I mean failing is the only way that you learn if you havent failed that he didnt try so thats just a good metric they have there and also youre never gonna do it amazingly your first time theres always going to be something that you did it seems pretty good theres always something that could be better that maybe it wasnt up to the standards that you originally thought and you just improve every time that you iterate so dont be afraid thing thats the hardest robot but Im sure you guys feel this before making a video public yours I know this is the worst thing Ive ever made yeah but I just need to do it you have to push yourself past that point that that wall that you have and just do it because if you dont do it you wont know if you succeed or fail to begin with whats that famous sports quote that I know about sports which is you make are you a hundred oh yeah it was a great right so its you you miss 100 of the shots you dont take Wayne Gretzky Michael Scott yeah yeah its from me well its from Wayne Gretzky but but no thats right its not for me if Michael Scott quoting Wayne Gretzky and when you quote someone you should also let everyone know that yes from you so so yeah Jake I think your hundred percent right I think if youre if youre afraid to fail then youre gonna have to be the biggest failure of all time cuz you dont even start you have to always be making bangs and saying that theyre finished because once its finished the lessons start to gel in your mind and so I dont ever feel like somethings perfect but I put it out anyway especially when Vsauce was was just beginning I was doing like IMG type episodes I couldnt make those longer I could put more things in them but I just wanted to get them out I want to get them out because everything you do is a lesson and so you should make and make and you should always make things that challenge you dont ever ask yourself but what do viewers want because we live in the Internet age we live in a time where no matter what you do theres gonna be millions of people on earth who are gonna find it interesting and the problem is when you start to guess what they want or you start following what other people are doing and you you get lost in the crowd be yourself and I know thats super cliche the cliches are cliches for a reason they work and you have to really embrace that if you if you look at a test tube and youre like why are test tubes this shape wheres the word test tube come from whats it to you  what if YouTube was a real tube but if it was a pipe and video data went through it in form of DVDs how wide would the pipe have to be all of a sudden thats a Vsauce video actually thats after seven years I could just go but but yet you should you should do you should answer questions and and explain things the way you would explain it as if it was a friend dont think of the audience as a huge mass of people in a theater think of it as one person your friend and you sit down nice safe dude have you heard about the Banach tarski paradox okay like heres this cool thing heres another cool thing and you just dive into it this is a television anymore where people are you know tuning in halfway through Kevin any questions youre seen coming and you want to answer Derek as if well get the one that we just unboxed yes this is the the one thats currently shipping and if you want to make sure that you get the second one theyre not the second one the next one after this then you should probably start with this one because that puts you in line for yeah and this one might sell out so you should sign up as soon as you can because its a bummer when you miss out and unfortunately thats just the restrictions we have like the boxes is very like premium its not like oh yeah lets just crank out some more its like how many can we make okay cool lets get these to everyone that we can and then yeah I really want to also start making videos we havent weve talked about this a little bit I want it not not making videos on the curiosity box channel as well where I can go through all of the really cool kind of sciency things that I have geometric toys and weird elements and stuff because I did that desk to it with Adam Savage and I was like holy cow Ive got hours of content here mmhm but the next Vsauce one video has been cooking for a long time its actually been the next  I cant wait to get those out in fact just Friday I was working with Erik our visual effects guy on how we see and last night I had this like amazing idea well I shouldnt say amazing because its actually probably not that good you wont know until until I dive in and see how it looks but I want to talk about how it even this is such a be sauce moment I was like how much of the earth can you see at once well what does it mean to see its gonna be like a bunch about even how the eye works and how vision works and the properties of light but I will eventually answer the question so dont dont worry yep Michael make it a good one do you have one I dont know okay go ahead it better be good what do you think that you would be doing if not for you  ah great question I mean before youtube I was writing music and a band play guitar and sing and wrote songs so it probably would have kept doing that I think that I ended up going to youtube because Im an introvert and being a musician requires going out and playing gigs all over the place and traveling so YouTube is a way for me to create stuff well just be at home so my creative energy into YouTube so anyway have stuck with musics Jake Ive been making videos on Vimeo so you would still be making videos yeah I mean before I did YouTube I was working in advertising and television making commercials so Id still be making videos the thing that was just so intriguing about YouTube is that its its yours right like you know you write it you host it you edit it you direct it everything is is your interpretation of what you want its not somebody elses and that to me is very exciting but I still be Id still be probably making videos just not as happily as I am currently I would probably be working at a university because before YouTube before I started making mashups and edits for the first time I was working dude briefly as a research assistant at the University of Chicago in a psych lab and that was what I thought I was gonna do I was gonna go to grad school I was going to pursue degrees in Euro psychology and then when YouTube happened I started making things and some of those early like Hillary Clinton farts videos got seen by millions of people and I was hired to do that professionally and I thought well this wont last forever Ill eventually go back and all work in as a researcher and and then no I I became a science communicator and I celebrate what actual scientists are doing who are way better and smarter at everything but I love being a kind of bridge to get the public excited and kind of get their heads wrapped around how important and cool science is Ive got a few questions about Eric if they can see Eric who Eric is reveal yourself Eric story come on over here what pick pants on all right heres Eric this is Eric welcome to the stream youre just in time for the end yeah so just to wrap it up is mostly getting some questions about the box doesnt ship internationally if you go to the website you can choose your country of origin and hopefully its there if its not then theres an email that you can hit up but the boxes are that we really really care about and its an expression of what Vsauce is but its ten well you can touch it you can hold it you can share it it again helps support not only sauce but also alzheimers research and so theyre really really proud of we spent a long time making even this like a lot of the items in this box remember the ink one in particular I think we had already had this designed and stuff in like December of last year yeah and it took all this time that doesnt have it manufactured and approved and up to our standards so it takes a while and its something that we really really love so hopefully you like it and check it out any other kind of things Michaels working on a new video they come out during VidCon would ya soon and of course Ive been Ive probably made more videos this year than any year in my life because of the dog channel if you guys arent already subscribed to dog check that out because we do obviously as you see way more projects than just the Vsauce channels we try to put science in peoples minds in every avenue possible I do the live show brain candy live were gonna be back on tour in the fall maybe I wasnt supposed to tell you that but whatever all will delete this live stream afterwards but anyway thats science like actually brought to you weve got the dog channel which is a safari around the internet showing you the coolest things people have built online that you can do online now guys dong and you know what honestly follow our social media because a YouTube video takes a long time to make we these kind of you know pieces that are labors of love but if you follow us on Twitter Ill have everyone share all of their social media now but if you follow me on Twitter tweet sauce on Instagram electric pants youre gonna get content almost every day especially little things that I want to show off a little like geometric things Ive built and and science and physics that I I cant turn into a big video that like you would expect but I want to talk about now follow tweet sauce and electro pants on Instagram Jake youve got your social media handles which I mean I know them but yeah so theres either Vsauce straight that link is down Kevin eyes Vsauce Twitters are in the description or you can follow my personal level which is Jake or awr yeah I have to on Twitter and Kent Lieber just just my name is Eric ever now its just in Atlanta for a couple days you can see some of the eclectic mix of people that I met while I was there wow thats so far dont know yes he actually is a YouTube channel where hes done some like Lydia he did one video about the effects on your what if the world what if the world ended the one that was like very 80s and opportunities that its so cool eric is brilliant with the visualization and the making of beautiful beautiful things that teach so thank you to him thank you to you guys check out curiosity box calm to help Alzheimers research and to get Vsauce in your hands too to your door we are going to get back to work we love everything that were doing we love you guys and should we say yeah and as always thanks for watching and now Im going to everyone freeze and Im going to walk over to the computer refrain anything and I am

headand I forgot my entire life Just like you hita delete button on a computer  quietlyWow  electronic music  ♪ ♪ Have you ever lookedat a photograph of yourself and thoughtThats what I look like Ugh We often think we look bad or not right in photos because photos show uswhat we really look like to other people The you thatyoure used to seeing is mirror you Every mirror you look intoreverses your face Most selfie cameras do this too so we tend to preferthat version of ourselves If you wanna see yourselfin a mirror the way other people see youin real life take two mirrors and position themat a 90degree angle What you see wont beyourself reversed but how you look in real life  So who would you say you are really  Is it how you look  Or is it how you dress  Or are you the atoms that make you up Because all of those thingschange throughout your life Ah maybethe real common thread that which doesnt change is your history your memory  But what if we remember things differently from the waythey actually happened Does that meanwe dont know ourselves False memories are frighteningly easy to create Today were gonna make some and were gonna havea little fun doing it We have created a fake game show called Who You Were Were gonna bring contestantsdown memory lane and have them tell usabout their past  Some of which were going to completely make up Were gonna plant a fewlittle seeds

go back to who you were Lets do it  We spoke to your parents Mmhmm  And they told ussome of their favorite memories from when you were veryvery young  Okay  Im going to start  with some true stories  before I slip in the false memory When you were seven you were pretty muchheld prisoner by a very controllingschool girl The girl took controlof your life and always wanted to knowwhat you were doing  I remember herLike she was like mymy best friendsort of but then she was also verylike possessive of me  But you guys arenttogether still  No we might beFacebook friends  OkayHeres a memory You werent

them feel likewe were all a team   Now heres the fake story  we made up out of thin air Heres another memory Mmhmm  When you were aboutfour or five years old  Mmkay You actually took a ride in a hot air balloonbut you dropped something from the balloon  I dont remember that at alllaughs  Really Yeah like at all  Were going deepfar back I didnt even know Ive ever been ina hot air balloon until you just reminded me It was in Echo Park  Was it Yeah  No clue   Timothy is not accepting the story as truth yet  Time for our second subject  xylophone trills upbeat music  Dylan how are you Im doing great man  You were uh inseparable from you Superman capewhen you were young Once you even triedto use your super powers to stop a cardriving down the street  Yeah try to stop a carlike with mywith my hand and everything Did you succeed  You knowthe dude hit his brakes  Okay next memory So when you were aboutfour or five years old you took a ridein a hot air balloon and you dropped something  Huh Uh Im not sureif I remember that to be honest   Sometimes enriching the false story  with a realistic detail can trigger the brain to begin filling in the memory Here goes Did you have a favorite toyor anything that maybe you had brought  Oh I mean I had likesome action figures I think Um I do rememberlike losing one Im not sure likethat waslike thewhat happened If I uh wasin a hot air balloon Thats a crazy adventure if I actuallylike did something like that  Hi Victoria When you were aroundfour or five years old you took a ridein a hot air balloon and you dropped something  I dont remember that Four or five years old Up in the air No  How many times you beenin a hot air balloon  None   Of course none of the subjects  remember the balloon ride  It never happened  but we are not done with them yet  24 hours from now  well take our subjects to Echo Park  Okay   The site of their supposed childhood balloon ride  to see if any of the seeds I planted today  have taken root This is where you tookyour first hot air balloon ride  Are you serious Im serious  soft dramatic music We might not be able to remember our past accuratelyall the time but at least we havedirect insight into our own mental states We know how we feel what we like and why Except we dont Psychologists callour tendency to overvalue how we explain our own behavior while distrustingthat other people truly understand their own An interesting manifestationof this bias is something called It is surprisingly easy to fool someone into believing they made a choicethat they never did and the amazing thing is that theyll also defendthat fake choice as if it werewhat they had always wanted film reel humming  We feel like we know ourselves pretty well  We know why we like the things we like  We know why we decided to do the things that we did  But do we  dramatic music  Today well be showing our subjects sets of photos  and asking them to choose the photo  of the person theyd prefer to work with  But this isnt exactly what it looks like The focus tester is actually a magician  who will be using slight of hand  to swap some of the faces they choose  for faces theyve rejected Will they catch the trick  Or will they justify and explain a decision they never actually made  Thank you for participatingin this study of first impressionsin the workplace You will be shown sets of facesand be asked to select which person you would preferto work with Are you ready to begin I am yes  CoolSo would you rather work with person Aor person B  Person B Person B  soft dramatic music Thats as complex as it gets laughs I can do this Person A or Person B  Uh B B A B A Perfect So weve made a pile ofyour ideal workplace colleagues Effectively Okay  Uh now part two is to if you could fill out thewomen in the workplace segment of the questionnaire  All of this businessabout filling out a survey its just to distract themfrom whats about to happen  because our magician is gonna make a swap  There it is  Two of the eight photos have been swapped out  for pictures our subject rejected  What will she say when presented  with photos of people she didnt actually choose  Now on their own meritsI wanna ask you what it was about themthat made you pick them  Okay  Well start with a picture  that she did pick before we slip in the rejects  So why did you wantto work with this person  She looks niceShe looks really nice but I think the personI compared her to didnt look very friendly Gotcha  Heres another pair of photos  where she had a clear preference  Person B Person B   Now were going to show her  the picture she actually rejected  Why did you wantto work with this person  Um she just looked nicerthan the other one laughs Yeah  That was onewhere the other girl didnt look very nice at all   Is she just misremembering  this one choice  How about another photo she rejected  Why did you preferto work with this person  She looks super sweet  So that waswhat you were thinking when you chose thatchose her Mmhmm I feel like she would beone of those girls that would likeon the birthdays get you the card andlaughs She just looks really sweet   This isnt just simple misremembering This is fabricating a past that never happened  Will any of our other subjects  justify choices that they never made  Person A or Person B  A   Now well present him with the photo he rejected  So why did you

face and to decide which of those four emotionsthe face is expressing Makes sense  Each photo is designed to display  one standard emotion that is known to elicit  an established consensus  For

and grumpy   Although we communicate a ton of information with our faces in the interest of looking younger  many people pay to be injected with a chemical  that essentially renders our faces mute  or rather gives us a sort of facial speech impediment  Botox was first used in the 1970s to treat muscular eye disorders like crossed eyes  and uncontrollable blinking  The FDA didnt approve the use of Botox  for cosmetic procedures until 2002  The active ingredient in Botox is a toxin  produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum  This toxin can cause botulism in larger amounts  but in smaller amounts when injected into say  the wrinkles between your eyebrows or around your mouth  the toxin blocks the nerves from delivering signals  to the facial muscles telling them to contract bell tings  Pull your hair backa little bit  Yes And then tell me what areas you were thinkingof getting it done  So I was thinking here cause I have a couple wrinkles that are starting to show Okay  Im 31 years old and I want to get Botox becauseI want to look young forever   Common expressions that people want to get rid of is the angry lines the furrowswe get in between the eyes  And the horizontal wrinkles we get in our forehead  that will go away  If the Botox procedure  prevents these patients from being able to mirror  the facial expressions of others  will it also impede their ability to recognize  the emotions associated with those expressions  Have you had Botox before I never have  Do you wanna touch everything If we can yeah  Yeah definitely Awesome I think Botox is probablygoing to change my expressions and I might have to overdo thema little bit  but I already do that anyway so I think that it wont matterso much  You doing okay Mmhmm   Well soon explore whether paralyzing

correctly  But after Botox our participents correctly identified only 738 of the positive emotions  and 688 of the negative emotions  So at least in our modest sample  once our participents lost their ability to frown  they found it especially difficult  to identify negative emotions in others  But if modern advances like Botox can impede  our capacity to read others faces  can other forms of technology enhance our ability  to see emotions  Author and theoretical neurobiologist Mark Changizi  has developed a scientific way to read facial expressions Mark Im glad you came overbecause you have knowledge about facial expressionsand whats going on beyond just the more obviousexternal stuff Is blood flow partof facial expressions  Yeah so we dontusually think about it but at all times youre seeing these subtle modulationsof color And as you get more bloodor less blood under the skin  it becomes bluer or yellower and as it becomes more  or less oxygenated  it becomes redder or greener  And this is true independent of what ethnicity you arewhat race you are or what kind of primate you areIts the same  What emotions correlateto what colors  Well theres a rough sensein which when youre angry  youre showing oxygenated blood  When youre sad its more likely  to be showing greener  If youre fearful your blood pumps away  from the periphery which means  that it gets yellower  So Mark youve broughtsome tools with you an invention of yoursactually that helps us better perceivethese color changes  Thats right so theseare what paramedics wear cause theyre niceprotective eyewear that they shouldbe wearing anyway  and when you wear these your veins  suddenly theyre glowing a little bit  The same technology that helps paramedics see veins also allows youto see emotions better because its enhancingthat same oxygenation signal that those emotions rely upon  So youve got glassesthat allow us  to better see the colors that are related to emotion  and how its affected by blood flow  Thats rightThis is not the kind of thing its not like you lookand it says angry you knowwritten across the screen No it works on yournormal intuitions The idea is that it makesthose signals easier to see so it should give youmore insight into what their moodwhat their intent is   Whether through technology or evolution  we humans have always found a way to read  and use facial expressions  And those expressions show no sign  of becoming less important  unless we evolve past having faces of course So did you like the show If you didntput a pencil in your mouth and go watch

But perhaps the most surprising way  that the brain and pain interact  can be demonstrated by the nocebo effect  Have you ever heard of the placebo effect  Its like when a fake pain pill  actually cures a persons pain  because they have a positive expectation it will work  Well today  were demonstrating the exact opposite  If a subject expects  theyre going to experience something unpleasant  like pain will they feel it  even if it actually exists only in their mind  Weve told our subject that shes participating in a study  to test a noninvasive bone density scanner  But actually its a totally fake machine that we built from a desk lamp an air compressor  and the kind of 10 laser pointer  you might tease your cat with It doesnt cause physical pain or for that matter  physical sensation of any kind It doesnt hurt at allYou guys this doesnt work laughter  But will the expectation alone  make our subject think shes feeling real pain  So come on in here Just go aheadand take a seat right there And then when you feelready to drive just let us knowand well dismiss you okay  Okay Thank you   First we have to make our subject  expect to experience pain  And to do that our actors are going to scare her a little  Sorry Jessica this is for science  So are you already done  Yeah I just you knowneed a minute Then Ill be good to go Whatd you do  Its like a targeted laser It tests bone density  Did it hurt Yeah   By the look on her face it appears we have successfully primed our subject  for whats to come  Okay Jessicawere ready for you   The question is when put to the test  will she actually feel pain  when there is really none there  This is Jessica Hi  Hi JessicaCome on in Wont you have a seat   Everything in this room  the medical equipment the hospital supplies  even the demeanor of our fake nurse  is designed to play on Jessicas mind  To psychologically induce the anticipation of pain Were testing out someequipment Its not invasiveWe need to measure the side effectsand patient reaction And I want you to bereally descriptive about what youre feeling And pay close attentionto the pain that you feel and how it grows  Notice how we are suggesting that she will feel pain  further raising her expectations  Im gonna give youa ball to squeeze for pain management okay Okay  And any time you want to stopit stops right away  Okay Okay  You ready machine humming  Its definitely warm Uhhuh And like like tingly   After only about seven seconds  shes already feeling aphysical sensation on her skin  where there is none  Keep in mind we tested our fake bone scanner  and the light emits zero heat or feeling of any kind  Yeah now itsdoesnt feel that great  You want me to turn it off No its okay  Were at 30 seconds Really like stinging  A sting A sting and like really really hot Now its hot Were at 45 seconds Yeah it doesntits  Okay Im gonna turn it off Okay thanks  You described warmturning to hot  It was like warmand then that like heat grew into more of likea sting  On this pain scalecould you point to the amount of painyou were feeling  Between a six and a seven   According to the pain assessment scale  she experienced significant pain This is completely up to youbut we can move to level two which is slightlymore intense  How many more levelsare there  Uh theres just five  Theres five levels There are five  Oh my gosh But again youre in the drivers seat  Uh yeah sure Lets do itchuckles   Heres another test of our nocebo  Will she feel an increase in her level of pain  if she expects to  You ready  Mmhmmmachine humming   Keep in mind level two is fake  Were not doing anything different than before  meaning nothing is happening to her  So yeah it started offhigher than the last timeI think Its definitely likealready stinging   Immediately she reports increased pain on level two Its 15 seconds  It feels really reallyreally hot and like penetrating  How deep Um  30 seconds I dont know like 12 and inch or likean inch Yeah it isits very hot Um like burning Like my whole arm is likeon fire  We can stop at any time You want to call it  Yeah Okay were off  Do you need a tissue Yeah thank you  Youre welcome sniffs  Could you rank for mehow you felt at level two  Like 9 12   The power of suggestion was so strong  our nocebo caused our subject to think  she felt almost the worst pain imaginable  Other subject felt different imaginary sensations  The muscles are kind of uh kind of burninga little bit  Stop How did that feel  That was like a seven Actually its tinglinga lot more now than it was before   I was surprised at the intense reaction  some subjects had to a feeling that was created  only in their minds  Look Im gonna stop it nowThat was 45 seconds Describe for me the sensationsthat you were having  It felt likea little prickle like when you getgoose bumps   What about our original subject  who experienced a severe 9 12 on the pain scale  How will she feel when she learns it was all in her head I want to debrief youon everything that were up to today So this isa psychology program and this equipment is notdoing anything to you This is just a machinethat makes noise And thats just a laser pointeron a lamp  For real For real  Oh my God laughing You were never in danger  We didnt do anything to you Oh my God  This is an investigationin pain anticipation  Yeah that worked I was so scared laughing I was so close to likegoing to like just say You know whatI changed my mind I was so close to leaving  You did say that you felta prickle  Uhhuh How do you feel about that  Whether it was reallyI did get goose bumps or I was nervouswhich is why I felt it I know as a person like if I think theres goingto be pain Im gonna feel something  I do still feel likekind of like a burning sensationon my arms  Really Yeah   The power of suggestion is so strong  that this subject continued to imagine a physical sensation  even after learning it wasnt real The name for the effectis the nocebo effect Its a negative effect causedby nothing but the mind  It makes perfect senseyou know the power of suggestion Im shaky just thinkingabout it  Pain and touch are weird But what about when touchstraddles the line between pleasure and pain When a sensationmakes you laugh and drives you crazy Im talking about tickling  Part of what makes you laugh when youre tickled  is the element of surprise  Your brain doesnt know exactly what to expect  or when its going to happen  On the other hand its impossible  to tickle yourself  If the brain knows where and when and how  you are going to be touched you wont laugh But professors of cognitiveneuroscience at the University CollegeLondon have inventedthe tickle machine  Subjects sit in the tickle machine  with their feet against a brush  that is connected to a handle  At first when the subjects turn the handle  the brush rotates at the exact same time  resulting in no tickling  Then the machine is switched into tickle mode  laughing    Which causes a delay  of less than a second between when the subject  turns the handle and when the brush moves  against their foot  laughing  This slight change  is enough to prevent the brains cerebellum  from predicting the sensation  thus allowing the subject to respond to the tickle  laughing  Tickles can be fun Pain not so much If you couldnt feel painthat would be great right Or would it Lets meet Steve Pete Steve I understandyou dont feel pain  Yes I was bornwith a rare genetic condition called congenital insensitivityto pain It only affects about 40 to 50of us around the world with it  Only 40 or 50 people Yeah So far that weve been ableto find  And tell me what it means whenyou say you dont feel pain  Pain is usedto detect injury and it kind of sends a signalto your brain saying Hey dont do this anymoreIts an alarm system So what happenswith my condition is we feel whats going on like if I were to touchyour shoulder you would feel metouching your shoulder but if I were to touchyour shoulder in a way thats painfulI would feel just a pressure and the signal of painwould not travel to my brain  Okay so you feel everything Everything else that I feelbut you just dont feel pain  Yeah Correct But that could be dangerous How did you first find outthat you had this condition  Well what happened wasI was teething and I chewedpart of my tongue off  So my parents quickly took me to my pediatrician  Wow Are you ticklish Yes  Do you itch Yes  Do you like massages Yes  Do you take painkillers No  What about a headache No  What about spicy peppers I enjoy them yeah I mean I do sensethe burning sensation but nothing painful  What about intestine painlike gas pain  Thats somethingI dont feel so that kind of ties intoone of my biggest fears which is having likeappendicitis or any other typeof internal damage that I just dont know aboutuntil its too late  Is there an upside to this Im sure that peopleoften naively hear that you dont feel pain Yeah  And they thinkOh man Well you should becomea boxer  The only upside to it isuh  being that I have had so many injuries during my childhood  as I get older I wont feel the pain that comes with it  Other than that really  I just try to live my life normally  as everyone else does  I cannot describepain to you Just like you cant describea color to someone whos blind  Which is where I run intomy problem with trying to describewhat not feeling pain is like  Wow Ill bet Well Stevethank you very much This was reallyreally fascinating  So not being able to feel pain is actually a bad thing But likewise the anticipationof pain can be bad too Just making someone thinkthat they might be tortured soon could be a torture device  The CIA and Guantanamo Bay are known  for using psychological torture  involving the anticipation of pain  against prisoners in the war on terror The effects of this typeof torture can last a lifetime So whats worse Waiting for pain to happenor the pain itself You might be surprised  Were basing our investigation  on an anticipation of pain experiment  conducted at the University College London  which gave subject two options  Option one Experience intense pain right away  Or option two Anticipate a lower level of pain  in intervals every few minutes  Researchers found that the psychological effects of dread  can often be worse than the pain itself  We decided to demonstrate the phenomenon  by setting up a fake research study We are looking into the effects of electricalstimulation on the body  Okay Its all completely harmless But it can be unpleasant Right  So well show youthe two settings all right I want to show you first what wecall the light setting okay  Okay You ready  I guess so buzzingOh  And then theresthe high setting buzzing Ow  Okay I dontlaughing  All right so againunpleasant definitely  Yeah But youre safe We call this the low voltageor light shock  Okay Ready  All right buzzingHmm okay  And now well show you thehigh voltage or higher shock  Oh okay buzzingOoh  Okay Okay   Now its time for our subjects  to make an important choice All right so now that you knowthe two differences you either can choosechoice A which is one high voltage shockevery ten seconds for a minute  Mmhmm  Will our subjects choose  the higher more painful shocks  but get it over with right away Or choice Bis one low voltage shock every ten minutesfor one hour  Or will they choose the lower shocks  but be forced to anticipate the pain for ten minutes  between shocks for a solid hour Either wayyou will be here for an hour  Whats worse A higher level of pain  Or having to wait and anticipate  the lower level of pain  Ill take the long  I think Ill do the shorter uh more painful one  Okay  Now that theyve made their choices  its time to see how our subjects  experience these two options  The subject who chose to anticipate  the lower level of pain during the course of an hour  is seated in the low shock administration room  along with our actors  who are pretending to get shocked  Hi   This subjects hourlong ordeal is just beginning  But what about the subject who chose to get it over with  and take the more painful shocks right away  Were starting now Heres shock number onebuzzing  Ow Okay   Yes the shock is painful but it was her choice  This is shock number twobuzzing  Its really painful  Shock number threebuzzing  Its half over  Exactly  It may hurt more but shes getting it over with quickly  Shock number fourbuzzing Number fivebuzzing Number sixbuzzing  Okay youre done  Meanwhile our other subject is only on shock number one buzzing Thats one shock down  five more to go buzzing  While the pain level may be lower  the subject has plenty of time for the pain  and its anticipation to occupy his mind buzzing  Hi Jeromewould you come with me  Oh okay  Finally his hour is up Tell me about why you chosethe lower voltage choice  I guess youreless pain you know  While you were sitting there waiting for ten minutesto elapse how did you feel  Its so quiet in there  so basically you got your thoughts  Your thoughts is like Okay its coming   This anxiety may be the reason why  in the original study a full 70 of subjects  opted to receive the more painful shocks right away  rather than suffer through the mental torture  of anticipation Why did you choosethe higher shock group  Just knowing that it was overwithin a minute  I think ten seconds is easier to go along with  and anticipate what was coming next So its kind of like ripping a bandaid offI guess  Youd rather Hard and fast  Hard and fast Yeah

for the whole day Its a combination so obviousthat its been around for as long asboth foods existed Humans naturally lovedthese foods together so they becamea staple of breakfast Or did they What if I

two people alone made a decisionand created something that is now taken for grantedas part of society just part of life Heres the real storybehind bacon and eggs It all beginswith Sigmund Freud  Or rather his nephew Edward Bernays  Bernays is credited as the Father of Public Relations the product of a timewhen the world had become just small enough that you could manipulatea lot of people at once because of the way thatadvertising news and radio could reach a largenumber of people quickly Bernays took advantageof mass media not with the intentionto inform but with the intentionto control  In the 1920s Ed Bernays asked a doctor  who worked at his agency whether a breakfast should be  heavy or light and the doctor pretty much said  I guess heavy would be better  Bernays then had that doctor  get 4500 other doctors to confirm that  All of them concurredthat a heavy breakfast was better for the healthof the American people  Then Bernayslobbied newspapers to publish that all thesedoctors were saying you should eata big ol breakfast But he wasnt doing thisto improve public health He was doing this becauseBeechNut Packing Company  a major supplier of bacon  was paying him to do it  The sale of bacon went up and I still have a letter from Bartlett Arkell president of BeechNutPacking Company telling me so   So we collectively as a country  agreed that bacon was our breakfast meat of choice  But we didnt actually make that choice at all  And thats just breakfast Our lives are full of decisions that we think  we make of our own free will  But do we  dramatic music These daysour markets are inundated with products and choices But is having many choicesgood or bad  dreamy electronic music  ♪ ♪  Most people say they like a lot of choices  But do they really  We took our cameras and a few pounds of jelly beans  to Venice Beach to find out  First we invited people to pick  one of two flavor choices  Yeah good  Yeah Im happy with itYeah Thank you It was an easy choice to make I chose it cause I wantedsomething fresh in my mouth  I like itI like lemon andcitrus and everything like that Good tasteIm happy with my choice   Most subjects were content with their selection  when it was a choice between two options  But what happens when we offer more choices  Will the subjects be just as happy with their decision  I see Not licorice Okay Can I do more than oneOr just one  Oh my goodness Mmm Mmhmm Well Im kind of regrettingnot trying a fruit one Because with jelly beansits more fruit is more natural to me Like I probablyshould have gone for my first

All right Pineapple Very goodIts my favorite fruit Mmm I could have had blueberry which is alsoone of my favorites  Uh kind ofan impulse decision I kind of wishI looked at the whole thing a little bit more Yeah  Maybe I would have pickeda better flavor   So maybe sometimes were actually  happier with fewer choices  In fact researchers have been  exploring this idea for years According to the famousjam experiment a study by Sheena Iyengar andMark Lepper published in 2000 too many similar choicesmay even stop us  from making any choice at all  The study compared two store displays one with 6 varieties of jam and one with 24  Although fewer consumers stopped to sample jam  at the display with limited choices  a full 30 of them made a purchase  By contrast only 3 of the consumers  at the more extensive display  actually bought a jar of jam This is calledChoice paralysis But life is all about choices We like having choices Dont we  Or are we happier  when we have no choice at all

looks like a doll version of yourself the latin word for a little doll is a few pilla thats where we get the word pupil for a young student and the word pupil for the dark hole in the middle of your eye its a pupil because when you look into it you see the pupil of yourself the tiny doll version of you and you are in for a treat today something a little bit different than usual but I think youll like it Ive been working with Adam Savage on our tour brain candy live and I decided to give him a tour of my brain candy the little things I have on my desk the desk I work at everyday that are sweet to the noggin but before that here is a sneak peek at brain candy live but not really this is this is brain candy right here weve been literally yeah this is the show we weve been the last couple of days here and all the little colored pieces of paper right for you its blurred because we dont want to give it away yeah well maybe give that one away psych youve got to come to the show oh yeah lets not mess this up this is how I think through a narrative its either like this or on a whiteboard yeah I cant actually type it out linearly yeah and you can see how dense parts are you can see by colors where the audience is involved where theres gonna be something dangerous and how theyll maybe spread those out properly okay but wait this is not why were here were here because were in Michaels amazing Vsauce space in Los Angeles and I happen to notice that your desk is awesomely messy and yet covered with stuff that I wanted to get my hands on and we realized we should just shoot that so yeah let me know I wanted to clean it up but I dont kind of convinced me no the way it is is the way were gonna film it so this is just pure unadulterated truth thats really what Im about all right so why why do you feel like a little bit reticent to show off this is awesome by the way your deaths you couldnt set design this with this much chaos let you like a photo to go off of but Im

India India it is the only element in the universe you can chew like bubblegum what its a soft metal it gets softer when warm but its also nontoxic and its its quite rare I heard its on the endangered

gotta get those yeah Im gonna give it just a little turn all right but as youll notice even though I didnt put that much energy in it wont slow down its just gonna keep going how does this engine work well its all about temperature a kinetic approach to defining temperature the air is made of molecules movin and shakin around theyre collisions produce what we call air pressure now we say that warm air expands but really it just has more energy when a gas warms up its kinetic energy increases its molecules literally move faster translationally rotationally and vibrationally as a result the average force they all exert when colliding increases if the container theyre in isnt perfectly rigid these collisions stronger on average than those coming from the other side will push the containers walls out expanding the space within now thats what happens in our engine our engine has two Pistons a power piston responsible for moving the big wheel and a displacer piston that shuttles around the air inside your hand warms the air inside giving it more kinetic energy enough to push the power piston up turning the wheel the wheels motion then pushes the displacer down moving the air away from the warmer bottom plate causing it to rapidly cool and collide with the containers walls and the power piston less often and with less force so the piston falls turning the wheel with it the wheels momentum now drags the disk laser piston up pushing air down to the warm plate where it gains energy collides with the power piston more powerfully again sending it back up beginning the cycle again its surprising just how quickly air can cool and warm enough to move the piston its fast a classic example of this is the old eggsucking trick put something burning in a bottle and stick a peeled boiled egg on top then suddenly poop the egg plops into the bottle this is often explained as being caused by a vacuum forming in the bottle because the oxygen inside got used up leaving fewer molecules within to combat the pressure coming from without but thats not true the oxygen used by the fire doesnt disappear from the universe that would violate the laws of physics instead the flame turns it into things like water vapor and carbon dioxide there are however fewer molecules in the bottle when the egg is placed on top but not because they were destroyed by a fire instead its because the heat of the flame gave them enough energy to push their way out air pushing against the egg can get out because the egg is shaped in such a way that lifting it opens this seal but once the flame burns out the air inside starts to cool right away and well theres less of it inside now external atmospheric pressure is stronger but the shape of the egg is such that pushing this way only tightens the seal the air inside continues cooling pushing less and less until the pressure difference is enough that the entire egg gets pushed in and thats a piece of brain candy if you ask me the egg isnt sucked into the bottle so much as its just pushed in by the atmosphere because the pressure inside which would normally be pushing back equally has become weaker likewise you dont really suck liquid up through a straw you just cause the air in your mouth to push against it through the straw less than usual so the air outside can win against you and push the liquid into your mouth so make sure the haters know scientifically nothing sucks anyway back to how messy my desk is I think this does give a good sense of whats in my mind and how facades look  its like kind of an S this is what an episode looks like in your head before it comes yeah and my tolerance for mess is really high okay so if I need her to work I wouldnt even move anything Id be like look the trackpad and a keyboard are accessible yeah yeah yeah but its also inspiring to have little things around to fidget with for instance these cast puzzles but that one is called spiral oh wow the craftsmanship one on some of these puzzles is just I didnt realize it was a puzzle I just dont think in that not all those pieces come apart they do yeah that doesnt seem possible exactly and that what they do is they I think exercise the part of my brain that deals with threedimensional realization because I dont think Im very good at that it takes me weeks to see something in my head so Im trying to like you know what these are really good for is finger strength because theyre heavy and if you tore out of one for a whole day yeah youre like oh my gosh Im getting some some nice tone when you sit up at the seeing something in your head I mean thats the same way I build stuff I cant start building unless I can see the structure in my head do you think you look really good at visualizing things in your mind yeah no actually theres a theres a turn that happens and as a maker where you start being able to just build stuff in your head Wow and turning it over to drive with the turtles did practice make it a better skill totally practice makes it a better skill and every time I attack a new material its the same thing this is another thats another one and that one is really fascinating because as you pull it apart you dont see whats catching right how come its not oh right no matter which way you hold it and theyre going to lock itself these are like really modern Appalachians like wire puzzles now watch watch this I dont know if we can get a closeup of this but if youve got pins that are falling because of gravity this way and this way theres no way to unlock it unless you get some little centrifugal force happening or more precisely there inertia will cause them to move out and if I give that a little spin it just falls apart Wow force it it just wants to fall apart once youve spun that beautiful so yeah Ive got a lot of stuff here what Im picking up all the puzzles okay this is a play with those well yeah these later boil the solutions for those out there watching who should really get into my love topology stuff at the moment these are Spears that dissect into a bunch of pieces I bought at the dollar store three for a dollar but yet the the mechanism or the or the design behind it is so clever and so easy to put back together right I actually instagrammed it I was so like excited about the simplicity yeah how it comes apart and goes together this is um we when we finished Mythbusters we packed up my desk and it was exactly like this like a couple of hundred pounds of this stuff yes this desk is super heavy for a few reasons one is the tungsten cube oh there it is isnt that surprising ah this is larger but not as heavy and thats solid steel thats a its a plumb bob and I used that in the what if the earth stopped spinning video it was so heavy I could it like actually tape a camera to it and then have the camera on a pendulum so Im noticing youve got a lot of a lot of materials different materials and I saw you open this one earlier oh I think they opened down yeah so this is a density cube set each cube is one inch by one inch by one inch and it gives you a really good idea of density and how different things feel one of my favorite things to do is because different metals have different thermal conductivity I will like pull some at what once copper ones that have a lets lets do I are anything copper and Ill mix them up so I dont know which one is which and Ill just put them on my forehead and Ill try to guess which is which by which one feels cooler and the one that feels cooler should be copper it has a hopper on that can feel cooler the question is which one is covered I feel like the cooler one is its Michael Michael school thats for all the coolest but between these two the cooler is I cant get this wrong I think you actually cant get it wrong yeah I actually can but Im thinking that this ones copper you got it hey hey I can tell youve got a little anxiety about that work I knew I could do it if I didnt get it right on camera Id look like a fool my desk by the way happens to be littered with pens that you cant really see in the video they are pins that are erasable because the ink inside of them becomes invisible when heated you can erase the ink in this pin by just rubbing the other end of the pen over the ink heating it up to the invisible point a really fun way to erase a lot of stuff at once is to just use a flame these are is also a density set but in this case every cylinder is 100 grams thats 100 grams of aluminum and this is LED and thats LED and then we got brass copper I think zinc and and steel its that a standard tarnish on lead I dont know because its tarnished the part thats it thats the edge in the wood the reason Im asking is moisture or something one of the original Maltese Falcons two of the original multi sockets were made out of lead and they now have this very dark brown patina on them and I have wondered never wondered aloud but I have wondered if Brown patina is something that happens  it must but why did it not happen on the court that was exposed to the air Im actually noticing a interesting pagina on the brass and the copper as well from the contact with the woods yeah could be oils in the wood the multi soften could be Brown from many people handling yeah it could be alright so what do you think is the worst thing someone could conclude looking at your desk I wouldnt be sad if it concluded that I was disorganized because thats true right well theres disorganization and theres disorganization youre not inhibited from getting your work done well yeah exactly that is a piece of calcite that has that birefringence property right where if you whats it good out here thats double vision except it does double vision yeah see Im not disorganized I can find a legal pad in a second absolutely so lets just draw like a circle yeah thats not a great circle thats right and then rotate it oh no way yeah okay so what is the most recent object  yeah thanks for parking my loose tooth whats the most recent thing youve youve brought into the space the most recent I guess with oh thats really cool isnt it cool thats a call the TV rock its a piece of black site with fiber optic properties cool I found out that the famous fact about polar bear first supposed to be fiber optic its not true oh is it not true apparently its not so I didnt even know that fact but if you were to tell me and I would believe it ya know its a total its one of those silly oh yeah totally I buy a newest object newest object its the speaker oh I saw this yesterday yes that came in the in the curiosity box this third one and its it looks like a laboratory beaker but its a you know double wall thing with the handle you can drink coffee out of and it has milliliter measurements on it but I was like milliliters weve heard about those lets use some crazy uses right so what do you value my blood in your brain is the amount of saliva produced every three hours during the day if you fill it all the way up to 300 milliliters it also tells you that filled too here the beaker contains approximately 10 septal Ian water molecules I should of course point out the spit error I misspelled saliva on the Beger on every beaker in fact its completely my fault I take full blame and spit if you are out there watching please know that I respect you even though Im not perfect Im gonna move past this because I just did a rack focus on the globe and am i right that that is one of those bespoke globes made by that company in England yeah Ballard b globes yeah oh okay yeah well you can go get it its not really a surprise that I love globes Ive done a lot of videos about what does the earth look like how our map projections made and this was a gift from my wife on our wedding day what I am flattered if you look up at the top of the globe it has written the company that made it a minute he says our names right and then its got the place of our wedding in the date and in the base which is over there and it has a plaque that says to my husband on our wedding day so these globes are the most accurate I know Im very familiar with these Globes as I go to their website every few weeks and think that they make them really large they make whats called the Churchill yeah and you couldnt even hug it IIIi think this is a reasonable place to stop the the desk store Im just gonna go off into a corner and look at this for a couple yeah sure of course Ill get some work done hey you saw Michael here so there you go brain candy live hits the road on February 21st traveling to 40 cities around the United States check brain candy livecom to see which cities were coming to for probably coming to one near you the rest of our global viewers please dont worry we are considering and looking at tours and the rest of this beautiful glow but for right now its just the United States see you out there on the road and as always thanks for watching but wait theres more lets talk about the eye specifically blinking we all do it its good for our eyes to blink but is there a chance that at some point in the future there will come a moment during which every single pair of eyes on earth every single human is blinking at the exact same time a moment we will all miss do tube linkage you blink your eyes anywhere from 30 times a minute all the way down to well just three or four times a minute if youre fixated on something like when reading that can actually explain partially why your eyes might become dry or fatigued while reading also a typical blink lasts about 100 to 300 milliseconds which means if you are awake for 16 hours a day and you blink say 10 times a minute on average and your blinks are just to be conservative here only a hundred milliseconds long in a waking day you spend about 16 minutes of your life in blink mode with your eyes closed thats a lot of minutes to miss everyday but what about all of us blinking together well the math has been done on Reddit and the chances arent good there is a zero point zero zero zero zero zero four billion more zeros 1 chance that today every single human will blink their eyes at the same time or have them closed because theyre asleep that is a very small chance even given the number of days in the universes life so far you just wouldnt expect to have ever seen it happen or to ever see it happen so remember earth we are always watching and as always thanks for watching Music,172.8537170263789,threedimensional,0.0,1.0,p-VDVI1GMZk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-VDVI1GMZk

of likea pressure valve  and that releases that energy  in order for us to sort of build up again  and handle everyday distress  People who are angryand aggressive who then act that out whatwould they feel afterwards  What many studies have found is that its a shortlivedrelease  and it feels goodit feels really good to release  but what happens in the brain is  the brain enjoys that  Theres really a reward to build up that pressure again  and then release it again Its a temporary fixas far as we know  I didnt realizeit was so complicated and still being researched I thought it wasblack and

demonstration  All of our subjects will be taking part  in what they think is a reflex test  against their opponent Clint  In reality of course there is no Client  and what were really looking at  is the Catharsis Theory  Have our subjects levels of anger been affected  according to whether they committed  violent acts of destruction  Or not Stage three is going to betesting how your reflexes are workingat this very moment Okay So this right here is a static electricity generator that is going to providea little bit of a shock Were putting one on Clintas well and hes in another room but you both havethe same setup  Once our subjects are fitted with the shock bracelet  theyre introduced to the tests control panel  chucklesLook at this  Yeah its very simplified but that really helps keepthe variables low So both you and Clint will becompeting in a bit of a game The yellow light is going tocome on at some point and as soon as you see itcome on hit that orange button And if you hit this buttonbefore Clint does youll see the green lightcome on And that will mean that you won And Clint needs to receivea small shock okay And you can set this to a levelof your choosing  Sookay Light goes onif I hit this the green one comes and thenIm allowed to work this contraption  Correct Which controls how high the voltage and for howlong the voltage  Correct Okay  If however Clint pushesthe button before you do the red light will come onindicating  My red light and Im aboutto get it  That youll get a shock yeahCorrect  Well get a sense of our subjects level of anger  by how they respond to the chance to administer pain  to Clint Remember this subject just sat in the anger room passively  Did I get him Oh all right   The green light means our subject wins  How hard will he shock Clint  Im gonna give you a littlelow one buddy buzzingThere you go Just a kiss Ah got me   The red light means Clint won  How will our subject respond  to getting shocked static buzz Ah laughsYou son of a bitch chuckles   Not only does this subject  not seem angry hes actually enjoying the game  All right buzzingHow about that Im not gonna harm you man Gave ya a little low one   He actually seems relatively calm  Will our other passive subject follow suit static buzz Clint gave her a painful shock  Lets see how strongly she retaliates buzzing  Even after getting a shock from Clint  this subject is still hesitant  to give him a shock in return  over PA Okay Clint and Drea  this is just a reminder that you are you are allowed to changethat dial to what you think would beappropriate  Yeah I just dont want tolike hurt him or anything Im just gonna keep it at low   So the angry subjects who sat passively  seemed to have calmed down  Now its time to check on the subjects who acted violently  in the anger room  Did letting out all of that aggression  relieve their anger  over PA The experiment will begin now buzzing  Take it take it take it   Kashona  Thatsthats fine What level is your dial at  Um Low buzzing  He cranked that all the way up and hes laying on that button  This subject was one of the most aggressive people  in the anger room  but that doesnt seem to have calmed him down buzzing   Among our subjects  it seems that those who physically vented  their anger are still pretty angry  compared to that subjects who sat quietly   So at least in this case  catharsis therapy was not effective  In fact in some cases the subject seems even angrier  Ow bleep You know whatThats too hard You bleep dick Why dont you come in here andbleep talk to me in person  Oh my GodOh my God   Were all familiar with the concept of rubbernecking  Its hard to look away from a car crash  Oh my God   But why There are surely a myriadof reasons but one may be that ata primitive level witnessing danger allows usto learn and prepare for it Activities where dangerand destruction are likely are exciting  Starting in our childhood  physical aggression is encouraged  even in games  Take a piñata for example  As a special birthday treat  we are told to beat up an effigy with a baseball bat And when we hit it hard enough  we are rewarded with candy What parts of a childs urgeto destroy are innate versus learned Well there is a groundbreakingexperiment that shed light on this In 1961 Albert Banduraconducted a famous and controversial studycalled the Bobo Doll Experiment  He had adults act violently to an inflatable clown doll  in the presence of children  Then left the children alone with the same doll  to see if they would mimic the destructive behavior  theyd observed  Disturbingly the children did indeed copy the adults  and lashed out at the doll  often getting very creative with their aggression  and destruction Aggression comes in manyunexpected forms Why is it so hard to resistpopping bubbles in bubble wrap for instance Do we like the sound The destructionOr both Its like were naturally drawnto destroying these harmless plastic bubblesof air Destructive tendencies seemto be so engrained in us that we even respondto positive stimulation with urges to destroy One of the strangest thingsabout destruction is how people want to hug thingsto

The Brachistochrone,2017-01-21T11:43:48Z,25.95,16867094,481586,Music hey Vsauce Michael here if every single one of us held hands together in a chain of unity around Earth would there be enough of us to go all the way around the planet there are about seven and a half billion of us and thats a lot but remember that that many human bodies thrown together into one big pile would barely fill the Grand Canyon this is all of us in one place the physical bulk of all living human flesh on earth today would only make a cone about 7000 people tall and 2000 across thats it but thats a threedimensional shape what if we made a onedimensional singlefile line of people each with say 1 meter of room and we stretched that around the planet well we would make it all the way around and still have 995 percent of the human population left if we made a circle that included everyone the ring of people would be more than 24 million kilometers in diameter dwarfing the orbit of our own moon now thats not just a circle that is a sir cool lets talk about circles today specifically something that they do roll but what is rolling well rolling occurs whenever something moves with respect to something else and is always in contact with that something else and the contact points have instantaneous velocities of zero that is theres no sliding in mathematics the path traced by a point on a rolling object is called a roulette French four little wheel the centre of a disk produces a roulette thats just a smooth straight line while rolling on one and this is why disks are good wheels a square on the other hand would be bumpy but square centers can make straight smooth Roulettes across the right surfaces this is the principle behind square wheels which I recently had the pleasure of enjoying at the Museum of mathematics in New York City Stan wagon wrote a fantastic and famous article about wheels which Ive linked down in the description below its a great read he also contributed a fantastic interactive tool to the Wolfram demonstration project that allows you to build a wheel and then find the corresponding road shape that allows it to roll smoothly the roulette traced by a point on a disk as it rolls on a straight line has a special name its called a trochoidal Greek word for real TRO Coase now trochoidal prolate depending on whether the tracing point is inside or outside the circumference if the point is on the circumference the resulting curve is called a cycloid cycloids are very special and they are the star of this episode now Ive been working with Adam Savage a lot lately as we gear up for brain candy live our 40 city tour that I hope to see you at recently I asked Adam for some help with rillettes Adam give a favorite polygon you cant theyre like your children you got a favorite eye I dont have a favorite either I do have a favorite thing that you can do with the polygon okay make a cyclic on a cyclic cyclic on is an actual actual thing its an actual thing do have a polygon around here here this this heres a squid right right say this is a square yeah if I take one of the vertexes of this squid and I start rolling this square and you follow where that vertex oh shoot let me roll this better are you ready yeah all right the actual path it describes a curve described here yeah that curve is called a cyclic on and as you pick polygons with more and more sides you get closer and closer to what I want from you today okay a cycloid a cycloid now I I could have just done this in Photoshop and done like an animation like I normally do but you have a shop we can actually build and you can build the bit okay why did I want to build a cycloid well let me ask you this with only gravity to move you whats the fastest way to roll or slide from a point to some other point below but not directly below would it be a straight line well that would certainly be the shortest path but when you fall gravity accelerates you and falling vertically a lot right away would mean having a higher top speed during more of the journey and that can more than make up for the fact that a path like this is much longer than a straight line but of these two considerations accelerate quickly and dont have too long of a path whats the optimal combination finding the answer the path of least time is called the brick east a chrome problem and its been around for a while Galileo thought the answer was a path thats just a piece of a circle but he was wrong theres a better one and in 1697 Johann Bernoulli came up with the answer using a very clever approach to see how he solved it lets start with a similar problem you are standing in some mud and you want to run to a ball in the street as quickly as possible now a straight line would be the path of shortest distance but if you can run on pavement much faster than you can run in mud the path of shortest time would be one in which you spend less time moving slowly in mud and more time on the surface your bast on the angle you should enter the pavement at depends on how fast you move on both surfaces as it turns out when the ratio between the signs of these two angles equals the ratio between your speeds across both surfaces the resulting path will be the optimal quickest route this is called Snells law light always obeys Snells law when it changes speeds like when it leaves a material in which it moves more slowly like water and enters one in which it moves more quickly like air it always refract according to Snells law in other words light always follows the route that is the fastest for it to take Bernoulli used this fact to tackle the brick ista chrome problem light changing speed is analogous to a falling object changing speed but of course a falling object doesnt just speed up once its speed is always increasing its accelerating to mimic this using light which Bernoulli knew would always show him the fastest possible route all he had to do was add more and more thinner and thinner layers in which the speed of light was faster and faster and faster and well what do you know there it is the brick East a chrome curve the path of least time roll down a track like this and you will beat anything rolling down any other path every time Bernoulli was clever enough to realize that this curve can be described in another way as a roulette specifically he noticed that it was a cycloid the path traced by a point on a circle rolling along a line a cycloid satisfies Snells law everywhere to see why I highly recommend watching this video on the brick East a chrome problem this channel is fantastic by the way Im a huge fan the visuals and explanations are topnotch anyway a cycloid provides the perfect balance between keeping the journey distance short and picking up speed early now I told Adam all of this and I told him that it would be really fun to have a cycloid curve we could roll things down and he said clearly we should start building we should just start building it what we need is a circle okay thats a the height that we want mmhmm and then were going to use that circle to trace a night cycloid curve I want to do a race right so yeah yeah look if were gonna do like if you have point a here and point B here and you say that theres some kind of curve thats better than a straight line in terms of something traveling between those two then I want to also make a straight line from A to B yeah and maybe also a really extreme curve like that right okay got some protractors there you have a compass extension I do I have all sorts of Ive never seen such thing is that it yeah that connects to that give or take I almost am I feel guilty that this is like a dream of mine coming true oh really but its such a nerdy dream too its not like I want this you know Red Ryder BB gun its like I just want to curve that things roll down okay so then clearly when were done with this this is this is my Christmas present to you I think Im currently like working out a way to do this in my head that actually makes it fairly compact and not super not super complicated yeah take a blade and cut out like an inch around the whole thing Music how are you gonna do the finishing Im going to cut this unless you would like to on the bands you can start okay Music okay now thats a little bit rough so were gonna finish it on my disc sander oh wow thats close enough its pretty good yeah so now you want to use this to draw a psych psych Lloyd yeah so youll need a little hole thats what yeah so that the point of our drawing implement is on the rim not above it Im doing this right inside I dont think so it is thats even better than having the rim hole because we want the line to be right on the edge okay so what were gonna do is were gonna create a pattern for the cycloid curve that Im then going to transfer to acrylic to clear acrylic regular right allow us to see things really clearly yeah this allows you right roller sight because were just doing it its literally like that right oh yeah see this is perfect yeah pushed against here I shouldnt slip this is like a Ouija board for geometry nerds it is a Ouija board for geometry nerds okay there we go thats smooth out Ricci stack rone thats thats thats the curve that were talking about yeah thats the beginning thats the end and this is our pattern yeah cool thats cool okay so Im gonna end up with lets say 34 of an inch thick but its gonna have channels table saw it out of it mmhmm travel its length and in those channels will sit my clear acrylic acrylic curves and itll also have an upright that also will have the channels milled out of it on the table soft and thatll allow the curve to sit and be supported yeah a little backstop here easily at the bottom that will allow us to hear that they all hit at the same time theres a couple things going on one is is that weve got cycloid straight line and then weve got extreme curve right and are these you had mentioned bending the acrylic so we could adjust the no magically I have this is you like this the acrylic will just be a thin of acrylic just a thin sheet of it traveling on that will be and I have material for this some Delrin or acetyl rollers that look like this so from the side theyll look like this theyll look like an H ah huh in which the acrylic sits in there and the roller is selfsupporting on the acrylic but rolls down ah that is tolerance love it I like those curves while Adam and I build a reallife cycloid track lets take some time to appreciate other kinds of Roulettes as mentioned before trochoidal anon straight lines but an epitome oi is made when a disk rolls around the outside of a circle roll a disk inside a circle and what youve made is a hypo trochoidal names for the curves you make when using a spirograph toy notice that the holes dont lie on the circumference of the disks though some do come close theres a special name for epic rock woods and hypo trochoidal an algis to disks rolling on straight lines they are epicycles and hypo cycloids now if two circles have the same radius a point on the rolling one will touch the stationary one exactly once always in the same spot creating a cusp this cute heartshaped epicycle ID is also known as a cardioid if the rolling circle has half the largers radius youll get a 2 cusped epicyclic the shape of which is called a nephrite because it apparently looks like a kidney I guess 13 the radius gives you three cusps 14 four cusps and so on as for hypo cycloids if the inner circles radius is 14 of the larger x the resulting Roulette curve is called an asteroid because it looks like a star which the ancients also thought about asteroids 13 the radius and youve got a deltoid named after its resemblance to the Greek letter Delta 12 the radius and well you get a straight line this fun relationship is called a 2 C couple rotational motion turned into linear motion follow a number of points on the rolling circle and youll get the famous illusion where every individual point moves in a straight line but the whole thing describes a rolling circle put a handle on it and youve built a trammel of Archimedes aka an ellipse a graph when used to ellipses AKA a hillbilly entertainment center when bought in Osceola Missouri anyway lets get back to Adam and eyes curve comparison build okay okay theres your finish line you ready Im ready all right Ill count us down three two one go okay here we go 3 2 1 go 1 2 3 with the asleep was second straight was last straight was last the shortest distance between two points was last slowest way to get there yeah it certainly was lets try it one more time yep because it was super close the brick ista Crone curve was by far the winner yeah what a mouthful of a name by the way barista drunk East uh Crone but Keiths brick east across not related to the brachiosaur looked at our thats I once looked up the difference between ingenious and ingenuity and they dont have them and theyre not related no all right now ready Im ready 3 2 1 go yeah same results same result 1 2 these are so close its hard to tell Music well were answering the main question which is that the barista chrome curve is the fastest way to get there well a brick easter chrome curve is also known as a tata chrome curve that has another property thats that we should test whats it and that is its all you know hold up before you get to this weve established between these three curves that the cycloid made brick easter chrome curve is by far the fastest its by far the fast okay great you get steep and unfortunately you pick up a lot of speed right away but then youve got a lot of this with little acceleration yep you go straight down and you know funny enough you what you want is that perfect balance of gravities acceleration but also moving to where you need to be and that is asked thats fascinating to me that a geometry which is the cycloid curve would yield such an efficient exploitation of the forces involved yeah exactly because if there was no acceleration if there was just one force in the beginning straightline would probably be the fastest right okay what is the other quality of the Tata chrome curve you just said it Tata chrome means same time so as the geometry and math tells us no matter where you start an object yeah what whoops the clamp city it was my fault but also come on clamp no it sector you know how to do these tables are a pain in the ass because they have these lips on them and they actually thats like its its actually my fault so Im gonna remove the straight line guy as well so were left with a cycloid which is called a brick East a Crone curve but it also has a bizarre property where no matter where I start an object on it when I let go they always reach the bottom in the same amount of time wait a second so if I started here the amount of time it takes for this to get to the end is the same amount of time it takes for it to get to the end from here yeah and the same from right here well Wow okay so starting from here its gonna be tough because of friction yeah now if you do this in software its perfect but thats boring yeah this is the real world and maybe we wont start the network I mean if we do one two and three yeah are we actually I feel like we could probably we could probably get one to work from here like that there might be a lot of friction involved but look at always see we can always see weve got enough of them thats why we made three curves so we can test this property and these were all cut and sanded clamped together so they are incredibly similar I will have to tamper the edge as I did on this one yeah a little known fact that once youve torn paper off of Plexiglas it crumples into a really nice wall to be thrown long distances a Plexiglas in the first place Ive never seen it happen because it doesnt really feel glued I think this is I hope thats cool because in theory and practice theory in theory theory and practice are the same thing but in practice I went to the University of Chicago where one of their sings well that sounds good in practice how is it in theory hahahaha life of the mind there so let us see if you do if I do one up here and you do one there and okay yes so this has got to be without this I think the same person should release them because then okay Im it better so here put that one here okay all right so three different positions three this one has longer to go yep this one has the shortest path so whos gonna reach the bottom first okay here we go lets see would you wish it would say the one in might this one yeah go first ready yeah good pretty good that was awesome that was so they all ended up they lined right up alright lets do lets lets switch it up okay even I think youre gonna be the one to release them yeah otherwise it wont be easy to time here we go three two one Id be garnish them lining up yeah they line up like theyre waiting for each other Im gonna stand further away cuz I want to see the full path okay ready yeah three two one how cool is that they totally line up to hit at about the same periodicity they went for here so given the vagaries of some extra frictions here and there there theyre actually hitting this at the same sort of periodicity that they are when they start at the same point so theres that and then Music is this some is this the Tata chrome curved demonstration ring of your dreams it really is it is its also the brick Easter Kron rig of my dreams and the cycloid rig of my dreams so check that I keep doing that yeah that is really cool another one yeah that was yeah exactly on point Wow raesha see in this game no matter where you start no matter who you are youre always a winner theres always a tie so this is brain candy for me Adam toasties this is something that was previously abstract and only seen in animations and in text made real now I can put these wherever I want Im not stuck with what someone else did I can physically hold it and thats thats what makes brain candy exciting for this it is like that I love taking the theoretical and making it physical and actually honestly weve always had what seemed to me like sister enterprises yeah and its nice to join them together yeah this is this is a little child of ours isnt it maybe maybe one of us wasnt so good at sanding and maybe the other of us kind of saved the day but its real now yeah and its alive and I think its loving its life that was fun it was really fun true Adam thank you so much for your help working with you is always amazing I hope to see all of you out there watching at brain candy live its going to be incredible and in your daily lives may you always find the Tata chrome the solution that brings you and others together even if you started in different places and as always thanks for watching

Theres somethinggoing on here I dont know what to do so Im just gonnasay what they said  How did it feel to do that  Itit felt it felt like I wasdrinking the KoolAid like laughter Its very normal This study wouldnt beas famous as it was if it wasnt normalthough it is surprising because so many of us would say No I would alwayssay whats real  Right Right  Would you  Right no Clearly not all the time yeah  All rightthank you very much  upbeat synth music  ♪ ♪ People follow the crowd inall kinds of interesting ways many of which are pretty funny Classical psychologicalexperiments and hidden camera pranks often involve people actingtogether in strange ways to see if others will conform  Now theres nothing inherently irrational  about following the crowd in ways like those  Conforming can be a form of social lubrication Its just easier to do whatsomeone else is doing because to break from that norm would be to slow things down  If everyones facing the same way in an elevator  its not like you lose your personal sense of identity  by turning along with them  Instead youre just going with the flow  and not being awkward  If I see a bunch of people on the street looking up  and I decide to look up too  theres nothing inherently bad about that I mean what it costsfor me to look up is really low comparedto the potential harm that might come from menot seeing an imminent threat Sometimes conformityis harmless laughter  Even laughter is a form of conformity We laugh if something is funny  but we also tend to laugh  if people around us are laughing even if we dont get the joke  There are a lot of social forces behind this politenessa fear of looking stupid and no doubt a desireto conform to fit in Lets see what happens whentheres even more pressure to see something thats unfunny as hilarious  Weve invited these people  to participate in a psychological experiment  But heres the thing  everyone in this room  is an actor except this guy He thinks hes just killing timein this waiting room before the experiment begins  But this is the experiment  and thats no joke Hey hows everyone doing today indistinct murmuring My names Michael Nice to meet you all Thanks for participating Its important that everyonebe kind of in a chatty mood So heres a question anyone got some good jokes  I have a great one Oh yeah  Why did the hipster burnhis mouth on coffee Because he drank itway before it was cool laughter Get it yeah I get it yeah   Our subject thinks the real joke is funny  but keep in mind  the joke Im going to tell is complete nonsense  Its not funny Its just words  Everyone but the subject hasbeen instructed to laugh at it  The question is will the pressure to conform  make the subject laugh Okay how about this one Uh a giraffe is at the airport going through the TSA line And the security agent says Hey is this your laptop And the giraffe says I thought youd never ask laughter  Oh my God  You guys have neverheard that before  No never No  Its pretty famous I didnt   This is a classic example of conformity  Even when the crowd acts in a way that makes no sense  the need to fit in is still very strong Okay how about this one Uh two penguins aredriving in a car The driver says Hey could youchange the radio station And the other one saysNo radio Four wheels laughter  That was better   Laughter can be a powerful tool for social conformity  which is exactly why sitcoms  use canned laughter  How do you feel aboutcourtin right now  Uncle Jake if therewas a pretty girl on the other side of this house Id jump clean over it laughter   The laugh track entices you at home  to laugh along  even when a joke might not be that funny  So will our other subjects feel compelled to laugh  at our meaningless joke So a giraffe is at the airport And its in the security line and the TSA agent says Is this your laptop And the giraffe says I thought youd never ask laughter Hey is this your laptop And the giraffe says I thought you would never ask laughter What   Since our subjects are in a conforming mood  Oh my God   Lets take this a step further  Hey I need Katie and Lauren to come with mefor your interview  Sure  Lets see how committed  they are to fitting in  Will they repeat the nonsensical joke  to another one of our actors  We were telling jokes earlier Should I say the uh  Yes The giraffe Okay So  Hey uh Tim I need youto come with me for your interview  Okay Goodinaudible  I guess the joke has to wait  Yeah Dude you tell it You tell it bro Well  No you got it You got itSay it  Okay so the giraffeis in a line in a TSA line

he says um I thought youd never ask  ♪ ♪  Whats the funny part  I dont knowII found it funny And its a giraffeIts not a human  And you thought it was funny Yeah  What was the funny partthough Like  I think it wasthe funny part was the laptop cause you know howhes so tall  Hmm   Do these subjects really think  my meaningless joke is funny  Its time to let them in on whats really going on Everyone here todayexcept for you is an actor  Okay We have all been instructed to laugh at thatdumb giraffe joke which is not even a joke Its just a meaningless thing And then we see if the oneperson who isnt in on it which in this round was you how they respond Why did you never say What  I think it was peoplelaughing around me and I was trying to understandwhy that was funny And then I had to make senseof it in my mind and then I think I made itfunny to myself   That process of mental gymnastics  is known as cognitive dissonance  When youve done something you dont truly believe in  like laughing just because everyone else did  you try to come to terms with your behavior  through denial and justification Its not a joke I just madethat up and its nonsense  I know thats whyI thought it was funny  Cause it just wouldmake no sense  Yeah thats why  I dont knowThats crazy though cause it did make me laugh laughing Everyone does that  Yeah Its typical human behavior  Yeah Its true though  To go with the flowand to keep things moving Its about just beinga good social person  Its definitely aa conformity thing laughter  One of the most disappointingand terrifying aspects of our desire not to stand out is the bystander effect People are less likelyto help victims if other people are around One of the most famous examples is told in Psych 101 classesall over the world Its the storyof Kitty Genovese a woman who was brutally stabbed and raped in New York City in 1964   It was a murder that symbolized  the apathy of many to big city crime  On a March night back in 1964  28yearold bar manager Kitty Genovese  was stabbed to death on a street  in Kew Gardens Queens  Police say at least 38 people  heard her screams  but did nothing to help  The hypothesis was thateach and every one of them  assumed someone else would call the police  so they didnt have to bother to do so themselves It wasnt their responsibility so the police were never called And Kitty died  somber music  But heres the thing  Kittys story may not be an example of conformity at least not in the waywe normally think  because most of it was totally untrue 38 people didntwitness the attack As it turns out the actualnumber of witnesses who could have helped and didnt may have been as few as two and people did call the police Samuel Hoffman spent threeor four minutes on hold before finally reachinga police dispatcher So where didthe number 38 come from  Well its theorized that the police commissioner  actually lied to a reporter  about the number of witnesses who did nothing  in order to cover up why it took the police so long  to arrive at the scene of the crime  And the narrative of uncaring New Yorkers  turning a blind eye to a womans murder  spread around the world  making front page headlines  As more and more sources repeated reports theyd heard  rather than going back to investigate the truth a psychological phenomenon known as information cascadetook place An information cascade develops  when people havelittle information themselves  so they depend on inferences they can make  based on earlier peoples actions So the conformity wasnt onthe part of the eyewitnesses It was in the reportingof the story Theres a saying in journalism Some stories aretoo good to check projector whirring   Im going to give you this cup that contains lysergic acid 100 micrograms   Clinical trials

subject didnt take a hallucinogenic drug at all  It was simply a shot of flavored water Just relax and concentrate Well give this justa little bit of time to set in  It doesnt take long for our actors to feel  the supposed side effects of the socalled drug  Its like a like a line that goes across  Its almost like Im lookingthrough a kaleidoscope but its like fuzzy   Will our test subject go along with the group  Or will she be bold enough to stick out  and say the truth  Its like alike a lava lampsort of thing  Hmm Emma  Um I honestly I dont see anythinglaughs  Mm I dont see any shadows shapes Im like Come onI want to see a shape But I dont see anything no  Emmas honesty is making her an outsider  Notice how she says she wants to feel the side effects  which would enable her to fit in with the group You can all sit down again Okay I want to dothe audio test Were just gonnago down the line and I want you to justsay the word hello  Heres another opportunity for Emma to conform  Will she go along with the group  when she sees the actors pretend to experience  an auditory reaction to the alleged drug  Hello  Louder  Um hello  And how did that feelWhats your reaction  I hear like a delay Like um Yeah it could becalled an echo Its more like a Mmhmm  Like a reverb or something  Yup thats very common All right Ivory  Hello Hellolaughs Its almost like you knowwhen you watch a video

concentrateon what youre doing But I just feel so relaxed   Here we see an entirely new level of conformity  Our subject is actually experiencing  physical manifestations due to group pressure Other subjects also experienced physical sensations  that they reported in great detail  Hello I hear the echoI can hear the echo  So you know an echowould go out then in This is like just an in  I just feel like sensation like near my eye and nose area  I feel like its definitelygetting brighter though  Okay could you say moreabout the increased brightness  Its not comfortable to lookat the lights really   What were seeing from these subjects  could be a form of informational conformity  or even whats called  a contact high  a psychological phenomenon that occurs when a sober person comes into contact with someone  who is under the influence of drugs  and begins to manifest the same physical symptoms I can now debrief you on what has been going on So none of you took anything but uh water

I am prone toanxiety attacks though so I felt relaxed  Well you should takemore of this nothing laughter Human society isincredibly complex  And the dueling forces pushing us to conform  and also to express our individuality  are both necessary  Other people can influence us in good ways  and in notsogood ways  But at the end of the day just remember this what did the walrussay to the doctor Give

Isolation - Mind Field (Ep 1),2017-01-18T17:37:27Z,34.766666666666666,33008507,712862,Music imagine being confined to a 10 by 10 foot room in complete isolation no timekeeping devices no phones no books nothing to write on no windows Music psychologists say that fewer than three days in a room like this can lead to brain damage I will be staying in this room for three days clearly hes on the border of misery Music even in a city surrounded by people its possible to feel lonely or bored your brain is like a hungry sponge its constantly absorbing information it thrives when stimulated between smartphones and books and movies and friends and family thousands of sensations are constantly going into our heads but what if it all got cut off what is boredom well its believed to be an emotion thats a less intense form of disgust a visual representation of emotions developed by robert plutchik shows the ball on a wheel notice that boredom shares a spoke with disgust and loathing they are different intensities of the same emotion you see boredom pushes us away from low stimulus situations because variety and stimulation literally lead to neurogenesis brain cell growth we are here today doing what we do because boredom has guided us toward greater and greater challenges and bigger and more complex brains so what is it like to be deprived of the sensations and social interactions so many of us take for granted a landmark study at Harvard and Virginia universities found that students prefer to experience physical pain over 15 minutes of boredom to demonstrate the surprising lengths people will go to to avoid boredom we brought in an unsuspecting subject for what he believes to be a focus group we begin by introducing a set of stimuli one of which is very unpleasant Oh dirty what shocked the out of me our fake focus test continues so lets start with the shock button Jamison would you choose to experience this again I dont want to do that again why wouldnt you cuz it shocked me it could still feel it going down my farm now its time for Jamesons true test the test of boredom you will be in the room for 30 minutes please remain in your chair feel free to reexperience the electric shock button okay or not okay right at the moment of truth when the only two options are boredom or painful shock which will our subject choose hes not even looking at the button it hasnt even been a minute yet and already Jamison is Restless with nearly a half hour to go and no other stimulation in the room the shock button is a tempting object to occupy Jamesons mind remember what Jamison said a few minutes ago I dont want to do that again but will he desire stimulation so strongly he just goes ahead and pushes that button Music it took exactly one minute and 57 seconds of boredom for Jamesons mind to go from never again to sure Ill give myself an electric shock to relieve boredom sometimes stimulation any stimulation is perceived as better than none at all now this guy doesnt like being bored but can he resist touching it a second time Music were social animals whether its another human or a volleyball or an electric shock button youll make friends with whatever you need to Jameson Im Michael thanks for coming in today so tell me a little bit about what youve been up to here in this room Ive been sitting in this room with a button yeah and despite saying I didnt want to press it again I pressed it twice why I just bored in this room I suppose really yeah did that hurt yes the hypothesis is that when left alone with a very negative stimulus people will go ahead and reexperience it just because its something to do Music we dislike being bored so much sometimes physical pain is preferable but intentionally putting yourself into what would seem to be the most boring environment possible can be useful its called sensory deprivation psychologists have conducted experiments on sensory deprivation since the 1930s during the Cold War the military used sensory deprivation for both training and interrogation in the 1970s the activity became recreational with soundproof light proof floatation tanks that keep you buoyant with salt water that is the same temperature as your body all right so Im on my way to a subterranean float lab this company sells sensorydeprivation this will be a sort of training session for my three days in isolation and Im getting guidance from an expert hey Dominic how are you hey whats up Michael you know Dominic Monaghan from Lord of the Rings and the TV series lost now this is your first time this is my first time Im a little nervous Ive never been alone without any stimulation one of my favorite things about flowing is theres nothing else going on okay I cant see anything you cant hear anything you cant do anything you just have to look at you and for some people thats scared its like looking in a mirror if you out this notation tank is a really good way of getting in prepped for the isolation chamber but I also think he needs to be okay with the fact that its gonna put mass out of his comfort zone the mind is a good thing to lose every so often all right lets take a peek oh so this is the room this is where I will be floating for the next hour alone with nothing to do but listen to my thoughts Ill see you on the other side the mind is a good thing to lose every so often you have to remind fear that youre in the drivers drivers drivers drivers hey Dominic pause it it was really good yeah can we sit down lets do it my initial my initial thought my when I lay down was wow this is buoyant and then I just started thinking about errands and tasks but at some point well it was like dreams huh but my eyes were open like those sort of like half dreams you have either when youre about to fall asleep or when youre waking out thats when it gets interested youre allowing your brain to be free youre just floating in space youre just actives that are on the top of this pool floating in space so now youve done this and you do this this isolation booth delia that was in some way helpful or hindrance it made me more unhappy about whats coming up three days is quite a bit different than one hour some people choose isolation to learn about isolation as we prepare to explore other planets were faced with a little issue stuff in outer space is really really far apart within our own solar system even a trip to Mars would take months in each direction thats a long time to spend cut off from the rest of humanity stuck at a tiny spaceship to get ready for those journeys we have subjected some people to extreme conditions here on earth in 1989 a young Italian interior designer named Stefania Fellini volunteered for a NASA experiment to help study the effects of isolation associated with space travel she spent a hundred and thirty days alone in a plexiglass cell in a cave 30 feet underground in New Mexico in the absence of timepieces and any sign of day or night miss Fellinis body was thrown out of whack her menstrual cycle stopped and her sleepwake cycle changed radically she tended to stay awake for 20 to 25 hours at a time sleeping about 10 hours when she finally emerged she mistakenly believed shed only been underground about half as long as she actually had as difficult as Stefanis experience was at least she had books to read in my isolation chamber I will only have white walls to stare at alone time what a pleasure checking out getting away from it all relaxing banishment from society the silent treatment solitary confinement solitude isnt always nice what happens when isolation is not voluntary William Brown has firsthand knowledge of solitary confinement so William how how much of your life have you spent in prison probably like 16 years its like almost half your life yeah basically almost half my life because I went to jail when I was 18 on bank robbery this right here this is my home off enough about two years though was the longest stretch of consecutive time I was like five months total Ill tell you what really amazes me this feels so much worse than a jail cell this doesnt have bars letting in light or a view not at all would you have a mattress at least that would be the only thing in this particular cell that would be the only thing in here you would you would just have a mattress and that you would have nothing more this light will constantly stay on so there would be you know its always on that light is always been at night even at night that light is always on your left in here with your thoughts thats it I would sit like like say friends I will sit in this corner right here like based in the corner facing out no I wont face out and I will just sit and just concentrate on breathing you dont know its like youre in the limbo hey you never know when I got over the door Ive known guys that have served consecutive years inside this same little box how does that change them mentally its cars them for life really yeah this is what Im gonna do Im gonna put myself in a room like one of these and I wont have a clock anything at all no way to tell time what Im nervous about is when that door closes and the awareness the sudden awareness of how much time I have see thats the thing about it cuz once this door right here closes its like its its final this is almost a coffin really even more extreme than isolation from other people is isolation from other people and stimuli thats what Im going to be doing inside this room this is about as boring as a room can get its soundproof and this light will never turn off I do have a small bed but there will be no interruptions I will have no way to tell what time it is no meals will be delivered because all the meals are inside the room already white containers of Soylent I do have plenty of water and I have a wash basin with a white bar of soap and Ive got myself a tiny little toilet theres nothing to do but be completely alone with myself and my thoughts now psychologists say that fewer than three days in a room like this can lead to brain damage I will be staying in this room for three days a full 72 hours so Im gonna take your vitals first Michael is basically turning himself into a lab rat what we want to do is see what might change with Michael before and after his time in isolation whats gonna happen to his blood pressure whats gonna happen to his pulse his basic reflexes are there actually any medical concerns you would have Im just gonna be in this room you got a really bright light on there the circadian rhythm which is your natural wake and sleep cycle is going to be completely disrupted by this really bright light and once your circadian rhythm gets off a lot of other things fall apart hormone cycles cognitive ability metabolic processes so you know its kind of like youre giving yourself jetlag how great I think its important to test his cognitive ability to gauge any mental decline that might happen during at 72 hours of isolation lets try the reaction time okay dude this is pretty fun can I bring this into the room with me so whats gonna happen to my brain in there well one of the issues that might worry me is how calm versus neurotic you might be where would you put yourself on that spectrum closer to neurotic coming on yeah so I wonder if that might be amplified that is how my brain will work itll snowball Im scared Im not gonna be able to deal with the monotony and the lack of a sense of time and Im gonna have a panic attack in an extreme situation people can have massive hallucinations disassociated from reality have tremendous anxiety psychotic types of episodes Marty Jake yes Im gonna be gone for three days the danger signs to look out for are extreme agitation where it doesnt appear that hes aware of his own agitation thats when I think I might intervene Im not worried for him physically like I think hes you know hes safe in there but I think that hes gonna struggle in there hes gonna be really bored love you byebye Music by forgot to ask what time it was when I came in shes always doing something reading something talking to someone the or day looks really bored in this making their five offenders its just gonna be a horrible 72 hours Im actually pretty tired Ive been standing a bunch today normally when I change into more comfortable clothes and Im like ready for bed I lay down and then I pick up my phone or a pick up a book or something but I dont even I dont have that if he succeeds in going to sleep for any length of time thats substantial thats gonna be interesting to see it what time he thinks it is when he wakes up right I was able to sleep and I woke up maybe one or two times in the night so I think its probably you know 8 am Thursday morning maybe closer to 9 am I guess I should have some breakfast one two three Ive known Michael for three years and Ive never seen him do a pushup zy x w vu t sr q p o n MLK I think hes come up with some some good ideas for mental stimulation I wonder if its time goes by hes gonna come up with some more creative ones or hes gonna start to get less creative Ive done 200 steps now eight more hundreds to go and Ill be at a thousand why is it that so many people turn to counting to stay saying when theyre in these isolated environments well our our minds want to remain active there theyre naturally active the healthiest people who survive in these types of environments will do something to self stimulate theyll count theyll sing theyll do physical exercise one hundred three hundred steps and then some change that I just took right there thats just a little bonus for my body for my health its amazing how hard it is to tell what time of day it is just based on your body I think its about 700 or 730 pm on Thursday I think Im gonna have dinner now hes already quite off on his perception of time I was actually surprised at how quick that happened I was too you know if youre using hunger as your gauge thats out the window too because the shifts and hormones are going to change your appetite now they look at lab rats who have had their circadian rhythm destroyed and they overeat 13 at the moment Im feeling bored but obviously nothing dramatic if I had to guess it would be 24 hours now since I first came in one day down two to go if he gets a full sleep cycle in hell wake up not knowing where he is right good morning I dont know if I slept for eight hours or if I slept for three if you think its bedtime it is so long as you go to bed if you think its breakfast time it is if youre having breakfast what am I looking forward to the most seeing my my family and friends its not even that I want a meal its actually that I just want to have a meal with people I just want to talk to some people I just want some other words coming in to me than the ones that come out of my own mouth he enjoys sharing things with people and to have no one theres nothing coming back for three days might be difficult I am the only person Im hanging out with if youre in true isolation literally part of your brain is generating some kind of companion converse with I think having you here makes a big difference you know hes entertained himself in a sense you know talking to the camera and thats been helpful for him its really kept him cognitively aware I just feel like Ive really lost all connection to time but Im guessing its you know 8 pm maybe 9 pm on Friday a good time to get some some shuteye when theres not much else to do Music I think its Saturday about 900 am Saturday the day I get out so his dissociation with the actual time has doubled now right he wakes up and theres this bright light and hes thinking oh it must be morning Ive spent a lot of time to being entertained by my memories and Im thinking of the people and the places and the events and how I missed them and how I treasure those moments theres a sort of cinema in my brain a cinema of those memories thats kept me from being very bored so I think its 8 pm on Saturday so in about a couple hours I should see that door open hes not even close and I wonder how hes gonna respond to that Music I dont think Im getting out today a fear I have right now is that its just Friday and if theres still a lot of time left there are other times during this that I was definitely more Zen about everything now Im upset I cant believe the color of the light isnt changing in the mornings when I wake up its so much more yellow without some type of stimulation the mind wants to stimulate itself anyway and will begin to hallucinate and begin to play all sorts of tricks absolutely my thoughts are really incoherent there its hard for me to even to remember what I just thought in 712 713 714 715 7 fifteen 716 717 70 in a way our brains are kind of uh use it or lose it thing hes going to have a definite decrease in his cognitive ability a decrease in his overall sense of wellbeing how many bottles of water if I drink is there one more laying around here that Ive lost because there are only six here but then down here there are did I Music all of the dreams Ive had that I remember have been about this room theyve been about me being in this room and about he wakes up in these in the room its difficult for him to discern the difference between reality and dreaming sometimes so thats a real dissociation for him sr q LMNOP worried about him now because when he first went in there he was like bored like someone waiting for a bus you know now he looks actually depressed the soap is really unique its not a kind of soap Ive ever used before and I really dislike the smell and I keep smelling it because its just sitting there clearly Michael is not happy right now he he looks like you know on the border of misery really aggravated by how uncomfortable I am this seems like a very very long three days Music he was just laying there when I walked in I thought hed be you know city like bed you know this was something he wanted to do but I expected him to be bored terribly bored but I thought hed still be talking and trying to entertain himself Music it seems like Michael woke up from some kind of dream he looks confused Music Music Music Music Music Im really confused we did I guess not I guess I just dreamt it I am so confused Music is 72 hours over its 72 hours Michael you can come out all right Im coming out oh my gosh its bright in there its really bright in there I hadnt really noticed but now that you mention it were outdoors hey that knock scared me did it startle you yeah every little noise has been startling me okay you seem very with it right now its excited energy yeah like coming out at first I thought it was that I want to communicate but actually I need this direction too even if its just nods and stuff thats so much better let me just check your vitals before you see your family 155 over 95 so thats quite a jump in your blood pressure Music your pulse is also higher I think thats because youre excited to be out I think this is a huge rush Im interested to see now how you do with some of the more cognitive tests three 1809 seven  seven  there you go I would say you did actually a little bit better this time oh wow okay although we had AI pathi sized you would be worse at all of these tests I think the rush of adrenaline that you got from finally being out and being able to communicate actually had you more focused more aware and thats why you performed better I find it interesting that the tests you did the worst on is probably the most to do with the use of the verbal language and youve had definitely a lack of that over the last 72 hours it was just me with myself for three days it was only me how are you oh good I missed you let me say hi to my mom Oh glad you served right yes in the room I was fine being alone this is what Ive been living but then near the end as I started to anticipate coming out and and being able to talk to people and share my experience I realized how important that was if you only have your own experiences youre not fully having them you have to have someone else to listen to them and react to them and then youve fully experienced them anyway I Ive moved I dont live there anymore when I was in isolation I was surprised most by two things how easy it was to be separated from distractions like entertainment and phones and how difficult it was to be separated from things we humans evolved alongside the earth and other people I was amazed by how uncomfortable confusing and scary it was to have nothing but myself you know I used to be a really big fan of the Seine he who travels fastest travels alone I think I liked it because it made me feel better about how I preferred to be independent and to be left to my own devices but now I appreciate the full phrase better it may be true that he who travels fastest travels alone but he who travels furthest travels with others and as always thanks for watching this season on minefield Music ready ready hold the drug in your mouth until we say swallow theyve been some audiovisual distortions we

Spinning,2016-12-10T21:27:14Z,17.516666666666666,11417625,310768,hey Vsauce Michael here do you want my head delivered to your door in a box well too bad I only have one head and I already called dibs on it plus my neck is like pure muscle this head aint never coming off the next best thing is what actually comes in the curiosity box by Vsauce it is chock full of science gear designed by us its pretty amazing and a portion of all proceeds go to Alzheimers research so a subscription isnt just good for your brain its good for all of our brains now if you subscribe right now theres still time to get this box the latest one it is full of brain food including the topic of this video a gyroscope if you hold a gyroscope in the palm of your hand upright like this it will fall over thats not very surprising you see the trick is to take the included string and thread it through a hole and then spin the disc around to the string wraps around and around and around and around once its sufficiently wound up hold the outside and give the string a firm pull ah yeah now the gyroscope appears to defy gravity the axis that spins around is like glued in place almost cosmically if you could get this to spin long enough you could actually watch as that access did move but not because it actually moved because you and earth moved around it thats actually where it gets its name gyro scope you can use it to scope watch the gyro gyration rotation of the earth as léon foucault did in 1852 when the device got its name but how does it work why are spinning things so stable also watch this if I give it a good spin and then hang it from its own string sideways it will remain parallel to the ground but process around to get to the bottom of whats up or whether as the cool kids are saying nowadays begin by imagining yourself swinging a ball around your head on a rope even though the ball is following a curved path its velocity is at any given instant straight tangent to its path you can demonstrate this to yourself by letting go the ball will shoot out at the velocity it had at the moment you let go it doesnt curve away or fly directly away while rotating the rope keeps the ball always at the same distance from the center which means continuously changing the direction of the balls velocity now that requires force and in this case that force is delivered by tension in the rope the same intermolecular forces that attract neighboring rope molecules to each other and are the reason the rope doesnt just disintegrate also resists the balls momentum acting on it such that its velocity changes every next instant so as to always follow a circular path this Center seeking force that acts on the ball is called a centripetal force it can be provided by a rope an entire disk of material something invisible like gravity or from the other side by a wall or banked track side note notice that there is no force acting on the ball that goes directly outward away from the center what we often hear called a centrifugal or centrifugal force you know the force you seem to feel when you lock hands with someone and you both spin around and you feel pulled straight back or when a car urine turns quickly and youre suddenly thrown away from the center the thing is this seemingly outward directed force isnt a force at all its actually just an objects inertia the path the object would take if no other forces acted on it being blocked by a force a centripetal force across sufficiently short timescales an inertial path can seem like its opposite a centripetal force but if allowed to follow its inertial path for a while the difference becomes more clear here is a ball in orbit if the centripetal force is removed it will continue along on a path tangent to its previous circular one the outline represents where the ball would be if it hadnt have been released now at first the separation between the two appears to occur directly away from the center straight out but if allowed to continue a more interesting path emerges from the perspective of the outline which is still moving counterclockwise the solid ball appears to be receding and dragging behind clockwise this is due to the Coriolis effect which we will talk about soon but first lets push some stuff around it could really be anything but I would love to use this ball its very cool it has fiber optic properties it would be awesome to get these into curiosity boxes down the line I will see what I can do anyway if I push the ball it will move in the direction of my force pretty simple but if the ball is moving before I touch it its velocity doesnt just disappear instead both combine and the ball moves according to their sum the lower its initial momentum the greater this angle now lets go back to circular motion imagine a satellite orbiting Earth its velocity is as we showed before at all times tangent to its circular path a centripetal force from gravity continuously swings its velocity around so that every 90 degrees it starts pointing more and more in the opposite direction it used to be just like with the ball a downwards force wont send it straight down instead the vectors combine resulting in a new path like this 90 degrees ahead it reaches the maximum distance it will travel in the direction of our force before going back the key point here is that a downwards force at this location didnt move the orbit like this it moved the orbit like this tilting it 90 degrees ahead of where we acted now imagine the satellite as a small piece of our gyroscope pushing down here will cause the piece to assume a path that would take it like this but of course since the disk is solid in all of its pieces quite rigidly push and pull each other the gyroscope itself tilts like this or if the gyro pivots around a point below its center like this if the gyro wasnt spinning pushing it down here would have just caused this to happen but when something is spinning its component parts have other vectors you need to consider I learned a fun demonstration of this from a great video by Matthias Wandel this is a cardboard disc I cut it out myself I can balance it on the end of a pen just like this and if I blow on the side nearest me it tilts to me not very surprising but if the disc is spinning and I blow in the same place it tilts to the right and if I blow on the side nearest you instead of tilting to you well it tilts to the left if instead of applying my force in one location the whole time I instead apply the force wherever the tilt is greatest down well the tilt will glide around and around watch Music Ive run out of air but the point is this is exactly what is going on when a gyroscope here on earth is spun up and tilted the tilt glides around this is called precession whats happening is actually very similar to my breath moving around except instead of my breath its gravity no matter how perfectly upright a gyroscope is it will not stay that way forever any deviation no matter how slight will allow gravity to form a torque a torque occurs whenever a force rotates an object around a pivot point if the disk is spinning the effect of that torque will move 90 degrees ahead in the rotation like so but now the torque is operating this way so its effect will have to be felt 90 degrees ahead and so on and well what do you know the gyroscope processes now if it wasnt for friction and air resistance and other forces meddling with this disk it would just process at the same angle forever but of course well we live in a world with friction and air resistance and all that good stuff so the disk spins down in the same way that a slower moving ball is deflected with a steeper angle as the disk slows down each piece of it is given a steeper and steeper orbit around the gyroscope tilts further and further down until it hits the ground and eventually slows to a stop take a look at this bicycle wheel its like our gyroscope but bigger I have a string tied to its handle right here so when lifted like this a torque is applied by gravity like so its equivalent to a force up here in this direction and a force on the wheel down here in this direction if I let go those two forces will do their work okay pretty predictable if I give this wheel spinning there will be other vectors at play a piece of the wheel moving say counterclockwise or along with the rest of the wheel down here will have a velocity tangent to its circular path but also a torque pushing it this way that will cause its orbit like in our gyroscope to move like this this force will have its maximum impact 90 degrees ahead in the rotation so the wheel will turn like this but well theres still a torque here pushing the bottom of the wheel this way moving that 90 degrees ahead we see that the wheel will just keep turning and in fact thats what it will do if I can get it up to a fast enough speed then tada an even bigger spinning object is the earth and we are all on it strapped in by friction and gravity for the ride a ride with some surprising consequences a helicopter cant just lift up off the ground remain motionless and allow the earth to rotate under it doesnt work that way this is because the helicopter the ground it used to be on and the air all around it are all also traveling with the Earths spin but if you had a magic paper airplane that could be thrown really far and you decided to throw it directly north to your friend Earths spin would come into play no matter how deadon your aim was every time you would find that the plane drifts a bit east as if pushed by some mysterious force and likewise your friend to the north would find that their plane thrown south directly at you would always drift a bit west this is called the Coriolis effect you are both on earth and youre both always north and south of each but in a day your friend nearer the pole travels a shorter total distance around its less distance in the same time your friend is moving slower than you your plane meanwhile is spinning at your faster velocity and it continues to have this velocity after you throw it as it moves towards the pole it finds itself amongst slower and slower things so it pulls ahead of them and drifts east in the direction of Earths spin your friends playing meanwhile finds itself amongst faster and faster moving things that it falls behind theres a vertical version of the Coriolis effect as well an object suspended very high right up above you will actually fall a bit to the east if dropped and anything you throw straight up at it will curve away to the west of it the higher up object whose circular path around is bigger covers more distance in the same time than you these velocities dont just disappear when things are dropped or thrown up so you both miss your marks its also why the directly outward pointing force you feel when spinning is fictitious your inertial tendency to move in a straight line takes you further from the path youre on to where things have to have higher velocities to rotate at the same rate if you fly out long enough youll notice yourself falling behind your original rotation pace not with it always directly out finally lose weight fast but not mass with this one weird trick discovered by a Hungarian nobleman and physicist people who think the earth is flat hate him its called the bush effect in the early 1900s Baron Roland von Hood Bush was looking at gravity measurements taken on ships at sea and noticed that readings were lower when ships were travelling east and higher when they were traveling west further investigations found that yes in fact when traveling on foot in a car on a bike in a plane doesnt matter you weigh less when traveling and more when traveling west in fact an airplane flying east at the equator experiences an apparent weight reduction of about 09 percent so if you want to quickly lose a bit over a pound about half a kilo get on that plane what causes this effect well when youre spinning with the earth you have a linear velocity but gravity a centripetal force is always resisting this if gravity was turned off and the earth remained whole youd be flung off on a tangent that rose above your usual path for this reason your inertial tendency to take this tangent path is a sort of lift its not enough to take you off the surface earth doesnt spin fast enough for that to happen but just as I can lift something thats on a scale and make it weigh less without completely removing it from the scale so to does your inertial path lift you just a bit traveling east adds to the velocity Earths spin gives you and provides more of this kind of lift in a direction away from the surface making you lighter conversely traveling west decreases your velocity in that direction lowering its lifting effect on your weight I will be thinking about this and maybe even weighing myself very precisely while Im traveling the country with brain candy live you got your tickets already right dont wait it is very very exciting and I cannot wait to get a chance to see you all in person and be more interactive with this kind of stuff and do so on a much bigger louder personal scale also subscribe to the curiosity box for more mind dynamite its fantastic and it helps a very very good cause I so fully stand behind it Im very proud of it and you know what go subscribe to dong while youre at it my latest video there is all about some of my favourite free physics simulators on the Internet you are all great I appreciate your time and as always

ANNOUNCING BRAIN CANDY LIVE,2016-11-30T00:26:41Z,3.0166666666666666,1353194,57458,hey Vsauce Michael here I have never made an announcement video but what a way to start Adam Savage and I yes the Adam Savage have been working on something delicious and nutritious and live on stage weve created a show called brain candy you can get tickets at brain candy livecom to begin were taking the show to 40 cities across the United States and its not a small show it is literally going to take trucks plural to carry the metric tons of stuff that we will be using to build and explore and interact with on stage these 40 cities are just the beginning if you dont see your city on the list give your local theaters a call and tell them that your mind wants a treat theyll know youre talking about brain candy now I will continue making vsauce one videos they are my blood but this show is a chance for you to touch my blood what what Im trying to say is that brain candy is Adam and I doing what you know us for in an entirely new format that lets us get closer to you videos are awesome but some things need to be felt and held and smelled to be truly understood especially intuitively for example what is this well its a huge piece of tungsten metal one of the densest materials it is safe and affordable to own this much of it is so heavy its a great reminder that gravity is a property of matter this thing is being pulled right down to the center of the earth and its crazy I wish you could hold it in your own hands and experience it and then we could talk about it oh wait brain candy livecom now I may or may not be bringing tungsten with me but the point is brain candy is Adam and I interacting with you all and bringing lots of you on stage so dont miss out as you can imagine Adam has been the perfect companion for this Im so grateful when we first started talking I was like a live show before YouTube performing live was what I did I cant wait to do it again and I cant wait for you all to see Adam and I together its hilarious and I mean wow I have journals full of all the ideas weve had together we have fit as many of these into brain candy as we can its a show that is great for the entire family and its what your brain craves brain candy livecom the best time to get tickets is now and as always thanks for watching you,149.8342541436464,announcement,0.0,1.0,VhVtK7UhKbI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhVtK7UhKbI
Is It Okay to Touch Mars?,2016-11-10T17:28:06Z,18.6,14642065,383281,Music hey vauce Michael here no rocks from Mars have ever been brought back to Earth and no human has ever touched anything on Mars but thats about to change National Geographic has asked me and Jake and Kevin to talk about Mars because they have a show coming out soon all about how we are planning to turn Mars into a home a place where humans will soon be living and working its a plan set to become a reality in the 2030s thats cool but beyond just how there are everyday life questions raised we would be literally beginning Society all over again on a new planet whose laws will Martian colonists follow what kind of watches and calendars will they use and what will be lost if we as a species gain Mars is it okay to touch Mars what will its flag look like in 1998 Pascal Lee designed a flag for Mars that was flown at the Hutton Mars project research station where how humans might live and work on other planets was studied the flag is a nod to Kim Stanley Robinsons famous red Mars green Mars and blue Mars Trilogy should we have the technological and political ability to do so at some point in the future we could terraform Mars from a red planet into a green with life and then blue watery earthlike one this flag has since been used by a number of Mars exploration societies and was even flown into space aboard Space Shuttle Discovery by Astronaut John M grunsfeld in 1999 that all makes it a pretty good Contender to be the first official flag of Mars the outer space Treaty of course prohibits National appropriation of celestial bodies but it doesnt necessarily stop private individuals or companies from doing so but since it takes months at best to actually go between Earth and Mars and minutes to even communicate at light speed how would and who would enforce laws on Mars if Martian colonists did things that we here on Earth disagreed with what could we do to pressure them otherwise or punish them for being criminals one idea extraterrestrial Liberty is to just give up control and release those headed to Mars from all current earthbased laws their nationalities hold them to to allow them to become Mars citizens able to make laws elect live and die the way they want free from any currently existing state that might be reasonable but it raises another question when when is Mars now what time is it there for colonists on Mars and earthwatch would be of very little help a day on Mars the time it takes the planet to turn around once Sunrise to Sunrise is about 27 longer than on Earth I mean thats pretty close but over time it adds up gradually an earth watch on Mars would drift and the time it said would tell you very little about night and day on the red planet to combat this scientists on Earth who work with robotic Rovers on Mars use Mars time they actually live by it you can download a program that tells you solar times on mars or do what many scientists have done get yourself a watch that runs 27 slower than usual if every second every minute is 27 slower than it should be itll be perfect for matching Marss rotation that could spell trouble for Martian colonists though who wish to tune in to live events on earth like sports or award shows but again given the immense travel time between the two earthlings and martians may find that having similar timekeeping systems just isnt really that necessary in their everyday lives okay right now on Earth it is um 20 16 as we know one trip through all the seasons from now will have been a year but in that same time Mars will have only traveled part of the way through its Seasons if Martian colonists continue to use Earth years thats okay but it would mean that for them years would feel a bit arbitrary they wouldnt contain environmental Cycles like ours do perhaps if they feel disconnected and emancipated from Earth calendars theyll just use their own Martian year system as well a few such calendars have been proposed some divided into familiar week and month lengths but with about twice as many of each per year the thing however that fascinates me most about putting humans living things on Mars is a more touching topic literally humans will likely touch the red planet in our lifetimes and the first to do so will be famous but jokes on them I mean we me you were all already touching Mars let me ask you this where did you get that body that one youre in right now its made of atoms and molecules but they come and go you eat and breathe and absorb things use them for a while but eventually shed or exhale or otherwise pass them through a month from now your skin will be completely different skin all new cells the red blood cells youve got now will only be with you for about another 4 months like a water wave youre a temporary arrangement of stuff a really neat thing that dirt does but not all of this dirt that you are the Dust In from dust to dust is Earth dirt new stuff is always falling to Earth anywhere from 5000 to 300000 k of Space Rock Dust debris asteroid fragments a day some of which inevitably winds up being you part of your body for a while now that may sound like a lot of material but compared to the mass of Earth its small some of these ET rocks are debris thats been floating around our Solar System since the planets formed some has come from asteroid collisions some has even come from Interstellar space beyond our solar system whats neat is that because atoms and molecules are so small even the tiny amount of interstellar material Landing here adds up to a lot at the atomic scale ask a physicist estimated that if only 001 of all the Extraterrestrial material falling to Earth comes from beyond our solar system and even if only 10 of that stuff is water that would still mean that 50 billion 5 billion with a B of the water molecules in your body right now as you watch this video were in interstellar space fewer than 1000 years ago some of the space material falling to Earth comes from planets like Mars when powerful enough impacts occur on its surface Martian material can reach escape velocity and begin an interplanetary Journey rarely but occasionally this journey terminates on Earth its been estimated that Martian meteorites only fall to Earth about once every 50 years or so thats a long time in human years but in Planet years thats nothing your physical body right now likely contains billions of atoms that used to be on Mars and arrived here on Earth in the last 1000 years if you consider stuff from Mars thats been here on on Earth for less than a millennium as being Martian well its tenable to say that you are Point 00000000000000 00000000000000 1 Martian but before you get too excited theres a difference between Martian debris that was roasted and exploded in our atmosphere centuries ago and actual still on Mars material the difference might be small or it might be big when Apollo 11 astronauts returned from the Moon they didnt splash down and then run into the arms of family members instead they were locked away in quarantine for 3 weeks just in case the moon harbored any kind of previously unknown or Unthinkable life form an organism or virus that could have come back to earth with them one that earthlife had never encountered and thus never been naturally selected to resist the threat of a moon bug pandemic wiping out life on Earth was just large enough that NASA took precautions though later buz Aldren admitted on Twitter that their quarantine facility wasnt perfectly sealed luckily no moon germs escaped and infected all Earth life probably because there werent any to begin with after Apollo 14 the moon quarantine requirement was lifted because it had become sufficiently clear that the moon was devoid of life but Mars well we still dont know exactly we havent found macroscopic life on Mars but the possibility of tiny things hasnt yet been ruled out and the incredible consequences contamination could have means it remains a serious concern theres even an advocacy group of scientists from all over the world called the international Committee Against Mars sample return but its not just back contamination that matters the transfer of extraterrestrial organisms to Earth theres also forward contamination the transfer of Earth organisms to things in space any life that might currently exist on Mars could be incredibly vulnerable to things we here on Earth barely notice but accidentally bring there how sad would it be to one day find life on Mar Mars Only to realize that its all dead everything it had to teach us about itself about Mars about the solar system about life wiped out just a few years ago by a virus stowed away unbeknownst to us on one of our robotic missions extremophile organisms have been found that may be able to survive such a trip life here on Earth may have even arrived from space in that way a concept called panspermia so should we be scared of monsters beyond our atmosphere Im reminded of the gloworm in their larval stage the gloworms stick to the tops of caves and leaves usually above water sources their glow resembles the night sky the tempting expanse of other worlds beyond our own like us bugs are attracted to this Vista believing its a way out of the cave of course its not the glowworms dangle sticky mucus strings from their perches snares that capture their prey are the real stars no different a clever trap that keeps alien Predators fed probably not but that hasnt stopped space agencies like NASA from forming divisions like their office for planetary protection a group that oversees plans for Missions that might bring Earth and alien life into contact currently all missions to Mars must satisfy the Coleman Sean equation this sterilization restriction Works to ensure that the probability of us contaminating places like Mars with foreign Earthly organisms is not zero but at most 1 in 10000 that was considered acceptable given the number of Mars missions wed probably do before fully understanding its exobiology so far we have no evidence that anything is alive on Mars right now or has ever been but that brings us to ansmet the Antarctic search for meteorites an effort that since 1976 has found more than 20000 extraterrestrial rocks in Antarctica the first one they found in Allen Hills in 1984 was special for one thing its believed to have originated on Mars its estimated that about 17 million years ago this piece of rock was blasted off the surface of Mars by a meteor and reached terminal velocity about 5 kms fast enough to leave Mars entirely after flying through space for a very long time 13000 years ago it got captured by Earths gravity and fell to our planets surface 12 years after its Discovery the presence of what looked like microscopic fossils were discovered on the Rock could they be evidence of Martian life the claim didnt convince everyone but to this day the structures exact Origins havent been explained how exactly to tell whether theyre caused by living things isnt agreed on either but the finding was a major event in the field of astrobiology and the Publics understanding of it the discovery was possibly so momentous that US President Bill Clinton gave remarks about it saying today Rock 841 speaks to us across all those billions of years and millions of miles it speaks of the possibility of life if this discovery is confirmed it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered after his statement these are the two questions he was asked by the Press did he believe abortion rights were under attack and where did he get his tie the thing is alien nanobacteria Dont Wear Ties they dont legislate or govern us or control our lives or look anything like us if they exist well most likely be in control of them and probably actually not even notice them under our boots so does protecting or preserving them not matter I mean should should we just not let them get in the way of our progress as a species well thats a fundamental question that touches upon what we want our purpose to be in this universe labeling parks of Mars dont touch as parks would be a great way to preserve it as it was before we came so that our grandchildren and their children can see what Mars was like for well most of human history others have argued that we shouldnt go at all that Mars is best left to itself humans ruin things and what right do we have to alter Mars if we can help ourselves still others say why stop at Natural Parks if we find viable Life on Mars it may be struggling to survive a rare Relic uh perhaps from a time when Mars was more hospitable to life they argue that we should help change Mars so that those remaining Martian organisms can Thrive and multiply and be their best selves with our technology intelligence and sapience we perhaps alone in the solar system have the power to help them and we should help our elves to Mars second these arent just hypothetical philosophical Problems by the way with plans for M missions to Mars just a bit under two decades away their questions we will actually need to answer quite soon should humans go to Mars it would be a great way to spread out to diversify our habitats so were still around should anything happen to Earth and of course it does give us more space for more people but for what ultimately Jupiter doesnt care if there are 7 billion humans or 7 trillion the volcanoes of IO will continue erupting whether or not we write any more poems about love if humans were wiped out today the fundamental forces of the universe wouldnt change and distant galaxies would continue their Journeys into the abyss beyond the obs able Universe just as they already are and always will what good is life to the universe perhaps it has none but we are possibly its greatest and only hope to find out we may not treat life as well as we could but whatever this darn life thing is keeping it around might very well be up to us we owe it at least that much and as always thanks for watching for more on how we

Talking With Attenborough,2016-11-05T21:04:46Z,16.166666666666668,2381166,104289,Music hey vau Michael here this is the song of the Kawaii oo bird in 1987 this species of bird became extinct there are no more but before the last living one died its song was recorded Ed this is that song it is the song of an endling the final member of a species asking to know one hey where are we all its a male calling for a mate that will never come for what its worth the song is still here we are listening to it now because it was recorded the species is lost but the song isnt and thats the heart of something really big remember that the word record comes from core meaning heart to record is to recore to bring something back into your heart Echoes fossils bones Footprints Natures memory is only so immediate I mean even light itself scatters is absorbed and Dems according to the inverse Square law the universe forgets slowly but we humans have created special ways to preserve moments to take them and turn them into stories things that can be shared recorded retold disappear perhaps much later than they would otherwise I recently had the opportunity to speak with sir David adomo the mind in voice behind so many important stories and natural history programs like the very new planet Earth 2 from BBC Earth I even got to see an episode and of course its phenomenal its also a time capsule of sorts a gift that perhaps humans alone on this planet can give Earth a record of itself Id like to share our conversation with you we covered many things techn ology science communication humans life language but lets start with one of the most immediate effects the program has on viewers its a mirror in nature in animals we see ourselves despair love hope heroes and villains now whether the animals themselves are aware of these emotions or themes is difficult to know or even investigate but I asked C David Adeno about storytelling and the responsibilities that come with that power this whole program is like a night at the movies but the characters are animals and they havent been scripted it makes me wonder if you know all the things that pull at our hearts that we write for the screen for actors are just us replaying the same dramas that have been around since Earth began well thats thats true life has the same um heart SW moments the first life the emergence of a new individual creature onto this planet the end is and in between well theres mating and theres aggression and there so on uh and so these are the Eternal stories um and you you you neglect them or or ignore their power at your peril I mean these are the important stories and you you try to do them Justice to them both fundamental truth profound truth and in the trimmings do you have advice for younger science communicators when it comes to reaching a large audience enacting the the change that they want to see I I I dont think I have any advice honestly uh Im still learning and still struggling with things uh and its a very presumptuous chap who person who who starts giving handing out advice um people know that know what theyre after by and large if if if therere any good in the business they know what theyre after and they know what to do and in any case the advice I give is bound to be about yesterdays technology or yesterdays way of doing things and tomorrow is what were on about and and its the its young people today who are using the new technology in ways that I cant dream of um so uh I wouldnt give advice to people I mean people talk about going to learn to make documentary films uh and and I say dont come to me I used yesterdays equipment youve got to be using tomorrows equipment and youll do it in your and that equipment will if youre true to it will dictate the way in which you deal with it in which you handle these things um and thats the way you get advances in in whatever technology or indeed whatever art were talking about technology is a big part of planet Earth too we can document record track and film animals now like never before in the 10 years since the first planet Earth drones have become smaller and quieter we have learned how to better find and study and predict animal behavior planet Earth too captured things that we science had not yet seen happen and in some cases didnt even know did happen I just was was really struck today by The Landmark nature of the program thats why I think its so important I think that were documenting things that 50 years ago no one even had seen and I think we have a responsibility for better or worse to document these things for ourselves for others and for the future I think we have uh very fortunate time living at un fairly fortunate technology has enable us to do things uh and we ought to use it with some sense of responsibility for the next generation and it it is absolutely the case that animal species are disappearing and its quite possible that things that I filmed 20 years ago in 30 years time will not be exist um so we have that as a responsibility I mean what would we not give to be able to see a a titanosaur a dinosaur or something people had been around that time mind the time scale is different silly better to say a mammoth it would be great to see a mammoth would it not or even a dodo bird Id like to yeah I wouldnt mind seeing a do do we have photographs of them or just paintings no no no no no we dont even have a complete genuine individual body really no uh the last complete one was a specimen in Oxfords Museum and uh in the middle of the early 19th century developed maggots and so on so they burnt it but they then some chat pulled out one or two of the bones but now you have you have uh you can put together enough Bones from different individuals to have a complete dodo skeleton so you know the shape of every bone but you dont have the individual and even the ones you see in museums no nearly all is made of sort of chicken feathers and suitably dyed and painted with a plaster head the camera can now capture things that nature and ourselves previously struggled to keep with such detail like the dodo bird which went extinct in the 1600s its easy to feel sad that such creatures are lost that we cant pet them today or that there wasnt a planet Earth program back then to at least film them but speaking of that emotion feeling hope and pity at the helplessness of an animal in the wild being hunted as prey struggling to get back on land to feed its children like these chinstrap penguins should we do more than record them I mean in cases like this ought we intervene and give them a helping hand when it comes to interfering where would you draw the line what if I wanted to like help the chin strap penguins get on to land yeah is that a good way to interfere or even then should I let them grow at their own pace well I mean if you if if you see if youre filming a little Impala form a little Antelope form how hiding in the grass freezing still refusing to move and you see a cheetah stalking towards it you and youve been filing this little por for because youve been relationship with its mother so youve only seen it suckling and so on and the Temptation you can see this tiat getting closer to lean out of the landr and say Sho you know and and now if you did that certainly the form would run and would be actually terrified out of it whips and run probably so far it wouldnt be able to find its way back the cheetah would have lost its prey wouldnt been able to catch up with it um and so the cheetah would go back and and have to find another impire for the first impire ofor will probably not get back and be knocked off by something else because its away from its own territory so what youve done is actually make things worse I also asked about humans where is the planet Earth episode about people he said this your own species is a different kettle of fish its why you cant make a natural history series about Homo sapiens thats any good uh because I I once wrote one I once started to write a series about why dont we look at human beings just as though they are animals and film them in the same way as you would film monkeys or Elephants or whatever but then at the penny Dro you cant make a series about any animal how human or anything else unless you deal with sexuality and courtship so suddenly you find that you are actually peeping Toms that youre going to you going to film people in courtship without tening them its impossible but you can do that with animals yeah but yes you do but thats the point you can do that for Animals because we are not animals and and not animals in that sense we are animals in other senses but we cant do it to our own species in my view right how are we different the closer we look for differences distinctions hard and fast discreet separations the more blur we see we arent the only things that use tools that play that communicate that have social structure the differences we hope to find often turn out to be issues not of unprecedented features but of matters of degree even language now appears not to be a sudden invention or gift but rather a property that emerged from a happy accident of more primitive features we happened to be in the right place to inherit sir David Adam bro and I spoke about distinctions and words when I asked about life what would you say defines life and defines defin life yeah life what is the difference between a particle thats a living and dead yeah dont know um because you cant simply say its its its reproduction because little bubbles reproduce uh you know its funny that that line is so hard to to Define when we spend our whole lives Alive yeah and and thats why uh when youre dealing with with with questions about well how did life start you say well I cant tell you how it started exactly but I can tell you where it started from the sort of things that that that began and they were things like complex molecules uh which got a a membrane around them and eventually before you knew where they were they were viruses but when that magic moment comes that extraordinary moment we still dont understand I like that I hadnt really thought of this before but yeah dead and alive or concepts we came up with I once tried to ask someone um whos an expert is a hyena a cat or a dog and he just refused to answer he said we make up these categories hes absolutely right uh um me we have this passion to classify and thats the basic classif because the only way you can handle very very complex uh subject you have to start classify in order to be able to get them into handleable bits but thats a human concept thats what weve done we have to decide that that thats a cat and thats a dog because those are the two things that we started off with but then as you explore the world you discover that there are things that are neither hard and you can then eventually if youre clever enough and lucky enough to find the specimens you can form a f genetic tree and you can see the sprit the time when at the base of root there is a thing which is what you might call a cog or a dag or a cat or whatever I mean which is neither one or the other thats thats the way it is and then they Diversified and then slowly became things but but its a its a a human construct what do you want people to take away from planet Earth 2 um as opposed to planet Earth 1 or or other programs youve worked on um uh the reality and the importance of the world uh the recognition that we arent the only species that inhabit it uh the recognition that in moral terms uh we cant assume that everything is ours for to do with exactly how we wish and that other creatures on the earth also have places in the in the grand scheme of things uh and that actually we are part of that and that if we damage them in the end we damage ourselves why is it important for us to record and document these things to give to give ourselves a perspective on ourselves on our own Futures and our own past our planet is amazing nature preserves itself as best it can but the hill it rolls down natural selection isnt about preserving the past its about survival we however can tell stories about things describe them record them measure them with more detail and voice than any other living or nonliving thing even if a story is just made up its still an attempt to articulate encapsulate and preserve something a thought an idea that otherwise would be forgotten I dont know if this ability makes humans different from other animals but it does in a way mean that we are our planets autobiographers the part of it that documents and records and tells about it so lets tell as many stories as possible and as always

Fixed Points,2016-09-28T14:42:08Z,16.433333333333334,9542578,297421,hey Vsauce Michael here there is an art museum on the moon supposedly we cant be sure until we go back and check but as the story goes in 1969 Fred wall Tower from Bell Laboratories and sculptor Forrest Myers convinced an engineer working on the Apollo 12 lunar lander to hide a itsybitsy roughly 2 by 1 centimeter ceramic tile within the gold blankets wrapped around parts of the spacecraft that would be left on the moon and etched onto that ship or artworks by famous artists according to everyone involved the plan worked and when the Apollo 12 team left the moon the wafer was still there now two days later Myers told the New York Times what they had done and this image of the wafer was published it contains a rauschenberg straight line a Oldenburg drawing of Mickey Mouse pretty cool and the story is likely to be true if confirmed that would make this wafer the first and currently only art museum on the moon but the thumb is covering something in fact its covering Andy Warhols submission why well according to Warhol all he did was innocently etch his initials on the chip he stylized them like this he drew a somewhat funny W for Warhol and then put a line right across here to make this bit look like an a thats it its just his initials heres an unobscured view of a replica thats on the moon right now I however am on earth right now in North America and this is a map of North America which is cool because if you are in the place you have a map of well mathematically there will always be some point on your map that is directly above the place in the real world it represents always it doesnt matter how you hold the map it can be rotated flipped even twisted folded or crumbled it is guaranteed by browers fixed point theorem a fixed point is anything that goes nowhere after a transformation Brouwers theorem tells us that it is impossible to completely mix up a set of points if they are bounded without holes and transformed continuously with no cutting or gluing without bounds every point can be mapped somewhere new around holes every point can be mapped somewhere new and if you cut or glue every point can be mapped somewhere new but otherwise mixing will always fail somewhere a transformation is continuous if as the distance between any two points reaches zero in the before state it also approaches zero in the after State each square of this checkerboard is filled with point like pixels of a unique color as we transform it lets have pixels still within the square they began in glow okay as you can see no matter how you resize or manipulate the checkerboard it will always glow somewhere you cannot get every pixel to be simultaneously outside of its original square unless you cut or move the whole shape outside of the space that used to fill heres a question do you think you can completely mix up coffee in a mug by stirring well of course you can not stirring coffee is a continuous transformation of the coffee and everything stays within the same space so browers fixedpoint theorem applies no matter how well you try to stir there will always be after the liquid has settled at least one point that you stirred right back to where it was before a fixed point to be sure coffee isnt made out of points its made out of molecules but theyre quite tiny and very numerous so within a degree of error itll pretty much hold fixed points dont just frustrate your ability to fully mix things they can also suck you toward them they can be attractive like the number nine try this think of a number with more than one digit and then add up its digits now subtract that sum from the original number to get a new number if you do this over and over and over again until youre left with a singledigit number you will always end up with nine every time also notice that any number with two or more digits minus the sum of its digits becomes divisible by nine right away whats going on here well theres nothing mystical about nine misc in general instead its just a consequence of how we write numbers numbers can be written in all sorts of ways but the most common base ten positional notation makes the nine trick work in this system a number like twenty five doesnt mean two and five it means ten twos and one five thats twentyfive so subtracting out just the positional digits of a number removes one member from each group the digit you have one of completely disappears the digit you have ten of goes down to nine copies the digit you have 100 of goes down to 99 copies and so on so the whole thing becomes a multiple of nine attractive fixed points also play a starring role in a famous method for calculating square roots its called the babylonian method the number you want to find the square root of is called the radicand and its square root is some number that is equal to the radicand divided by itself okay now step one of this method is guess if your guess is lower than the actual answer the radicand divided by your guests will be larger than the answer and viceversa the true answer will always be somewhere in between those two values so after you guess take both values and find their average itll be a point in between and now use this value as your guests and keep going you will converge towards the true square root at a pretty nice speed the number of correct digits in your approximation will roughly double after every iteration thats pretty cool but lets talk about infinity specifically Aleph numbers they describe sizes of well ordered infinities the smallest is alephnull equal to the quantity of integers that there are but there are literally larger infinities than that in order of increasing size they are Aleph 1 a love  Aleph 3 and so on each one is infinite but refers to a greater number of things than the infinity before if you tried to pair up alephnull things with Aleph 1 things youd literally run out of alephnull things first even though its endless you can hear more about Aleph numbers in this video of mine but heres the thing there happens to be an Aleph fixed point notice that the subscript of each Aleph is equal to the number of infinities less than it there are none less than Aleph null one less than Aleph 1 2 less than a love 2 and so on each next Aleph number is monstrously bigger than the last but only adds one to the growing list of Olives clearly these rates are so different theyll never meet up but they do take a look at this number Aleph Aleph Aleph alfalfa a load rule and so on an endless cascade of Olives how many infinities are smaller than this number well look at its subscript its well its an endless cascade of a lafes just like the number itself this is an Aleph fixed point and infinity so large it is equal to the number of infinities smaller than itself thats cool but probably my favorite fixed point related thing is the force of Coulomb theorem it states that at any given moment there must be at least one pair of points on Earths surface that are diametrically opposite one another but nonetheless have the same temperature and atmospheric pressure diametrically opposite points on a sphere are called Antipodes and as Ive discussed before if you place a piece of bread on the ground somewhere on earth and another one on that points antipode well youve made yourself an earth sandwich there are sites that help you locate such opposite points on land but at this moment in history youll notice that most points on land are antipodal to water which makes sense the Earths surface is mainly covered with water but even though we know that we dont always appreciate just how gigantic the Pacific Ocean is maybe because maps tend to cut right along at dividing its power but take a look at this this is the Atlantic Ocean all right this is the Pacific Ocean its really more of a water hemisphere the Pacific Ocean is so large in fact it contains its own Antipodes meaning there are places in the Pacific Ocean where you could float and know that even if you dug a hole straight down through the center of the earth and emerged on the other side you would still be in the Pacific Ocean ok anyway back to borsa Coulomb to see how it works lets imagine two thermometers on opposite sides of the earth a and B the temperatures they record will probably be different but if we swap their locations always keeping them at all times on opposite sides of the planet their temperature readings will just flip in order to swap well the readings are going to have to cross at least once no matter how we swap these always and typical thermometers a crisscross will have to happen at least one somewhere moreover these fixed points arent just peppered around the globe willynilly a continuous unbroken band of them must separate As region from bees why well because if there wasnt such a wall that would mean thered be a way to swap them without their readings having to ever meet which we know cant happen okay next lets pick a pair of antipodal points on this band and measure atmospheric pressure at both if theyre the same hey thats pretty good our job is done but if theyre not we can just swap the barometers along the band like with temperature the pressures they measure swap so somewhere they will have to have the same value even though weather is chaotic and always changing and even though the other side of the world is very very far away there must always be at least two places on opposite ends of the earth where the temperature and the pressure are the same this is true by the way for any two variables that vary continuously across Earths surface for is often called a cosmic number why well because try this name any number in English really any at all positive negative rational complex uninteresting surreal infinite doesnt matter now count the number of letters in its name this gives you a new number count the number of letters in its name and keep going eventually every time every single time you will wind up at four where you will be stuck looping forever side note if doing something over and over again doesnt produce a different result than just doing it once the procedure is called ident meaning same power taking the absolute value of a number is an ID impotent Act doing it once or doing it a million times gives the same result pushing an elevator call button is identity new on spill come to you pushing it again and again and again and again doesnt make it arrive faster or differently anyway we get stuck at four because its the only number in the English language spelled with the same number of letters as the quantity it represents about four years ago reddit user protocol seven showed that there are no other endless loops except for and that while negative 15 and negative 17 both contain their absolute value worth of letters which makes them special to be sure they obviously arent spelled with a negative number of letters for is for JUnit theres no escape a path to it is forced Oh Fork its even on my forearm well I look forward to seeing you again soon and as always thanks for

Alzheimer's and the Brain,2016-07-02T23:41:02Z,15.033333333333333,9297394,318094,hey Vsauce Michael here if you have a watch or a clock nearby take a look at its our hand it moves completing a trip all the way around twice a day its motion is too slow to see but try really look at right now watch how far it travels in one second okay one Mississippi done thats it see how far it moved well if this watch was the Milky Way that would be about how far we have traveled in our solar system around our galaxy since the invention of writing since the beginning not of time but of our history its a very small distance unnoticeable for most of humanitys existence there hasnt been writing physical recordings of events or ideas today of course we have writing and we have many different ways to physically store data we even now have digital ones but before writing was invented all humans had was biological storage memories there was no eiga pedia no phone book no library but what there was was old people of everyone around theyve experienced the most heard the most things had the most thoughts even today with all this stuff around the oldest among us remain the libraries of things that physical and digital libraries either dont havent been or cant yet Chronicle Aeschylus famously said that memory is the mother of wisdom but like all storage formats individuals dont last forever these can be lost we can die these can obsolesce they can still be around but have no way to be played back or read they can be abandoned ignored these can also just wear out just as we can forget or develop dementia dementia involves a decline in cognitive skills used to perform everyday activities 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases are Alzheimers the disease is associated with the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain changes accompanied by damage to brain cells and their death the older a person is the more likely they are to have developed Alzheimers but Alzheimers is not a part of normal aging symptoms of Alzheimers disease include a decrease in the ability to think and remember confusion about time and place new difficulties speaking and writing changes in mood and personality as we fight against other diseases and live longer lives Alzheimers looms on the horizon as if waiting for us to pass the test of other challenges as a cause of death from 2000 to 2013 many things decreased but Alzheimers has grown stopping it preventing it postponing its development in our brains long enough that we at least die of something else with our memories is a real goal we can achieve your brain fits inside this thing your skull specifically this part back here called the brain case or the arrow cranium its a bone fortress protecting an inner sanctuary called the cranial cavity your brain sits right here except it doesnt really sit so much as it swims you see the brain is incredibly fragile soft and gooey model or toy brains tend to be made out of rigid plastic and actual specimens used in dissection tend to be a rubbery because theyve been affected by chemicals like formaldehyde but real raw fresh brains right out of someones brain case are soft like soft tofu holding one like this for too long will leave a lasting and shaped depression for that reason the brain has to float so it doesnt crush itself under its own weight but it doesnt float in water instead it floats in a special liquid your body makes called cerebrospinal fluid now this isnt a whole brain this is just the cerebrum the largest part of the brain it plays a key role in language thought abstract thinking awareness consciousness it thinks its a pretty big deal literally its the part of you that does speaking anyway the outside of the cerebrum is called the cortex cortex means bark like tree bark or a ride or a husk if I tear off one of the temporal lobes we can take a closer look at this rind its painted in maroon here you can see its extent its only about two to four millimeters thick its often called grey matter because it appears pinkish yellowish gray in a real brain beneath it is the white matter white because although grey matter contains a lot of cell bodies the white matter contains mainly axons that are myelinated that send messages from grey matter to gray matter locations myelin is a whitish material that insulates electric messages allowing them to move faster and fast they do move signals travel through axons at up to 432 kilometers per hour thats 275 miles per hour about the top speed of the fastest production car in the world you can say this car literally travels at the speed of thought but thats slow compared to the speed of electricity through a conductor which is closer to 50 to 99 the speed of light anyway the brain is very wrinkly and thats because a wrinkled shape allows more cerebral cortex to fit into a smaller container if we could take this entire line all of your cerebral cortex flatten it out it would be well about like this it would be about 2 to 4 millimeters thick and have an area equivalent to a square 50 centimeters by 50 centimeters about 20 by 20 inches obviously you cant fit this shape into this shape unless you crumple it up and now were getting somewhere when we crumple the brain up we get folds the folds are called gyri Cingular gyrus and the crevices are called sulci singular sulcus about two thirds of your cerebral cortex is buried deep within sulci out of view as for memories well every time you learn something new or memorize something new your brain doesnt gain another wrinkle or anything like that instead memories appear to be more about connections relationships and patterns formed by connected neurons when neurons fire together again and again rehearse their connections and bonds become stronger they become more likely to fire together again to be recalled roughly that might be how memory works and its a helpful way to think about some interesting phenomena like the fact that its quite difficult to list off the name of every book youve ever read thats like really difficult but if someone were to just name book titles you could effortlessly tell them whether or not you read the book hearing the title likely excites neuron connections more directly involved with the connections associated with your memory of having read that title than a mere prompt to name some books youve read when brain cells and their connections are damaged blocked compromised or killed memories conveyed and the formation of new memories can be hampered learning how this happens in Alzheimers isnt just important for those diagnosed but also for all of us interested in memory in one to five percent of Alzheimers cases genetic differences can be identified but the cause of most cases is still mostly unknown a number of hypotheses and observations exist for example we know that 15 of individuals with Down syndrome who live 40 years or longer develop Alzheimers disease and 50 to 70 percent of those who live to 60 do down syndrome is caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21 we still have a lot to learn but chromosome 21 is also involved in the plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimers within this chromosome are the genetic instructions for the production of a protein called amyloid precursor protein or AP P a P P seems to play a role in neural growth and repair its found on cells throughout the entire body its processed by the body in different ways most often an enzyme called alpha secret tastes Cleaves it into SA P P alpha and C 83 less often an enzyme called beta secret ace snips a P P a bit higher up releasing a smaller fragment called s a P P beta a third enzyme can gammasecretase and cleave AIC DOA leaving p3 if alpha secret tastes active first and betaamyloid if beta secret tastes acted first the normal function of beta amyloid isnt exactly known yet it may play an important role in healthy brain function but if too much is made or maybe if too little is cleared away too slowly or if the protein folds in the wrong ways fragments can stick together creating oligomers groups of a few pieces say four or five these oligomers can then stick to other oligomers and become larger structures called plaques the effect oligomers and plaques have on brain cells and brain health is being studied oligomers may be more toxic they may allow unregulated ion flow into neurons causing their deaths what we do know is that Alzheimers disease is associated with these plaques in the brain as well as another protein related anomaly tangles a protein called tau stabilizes microtubules in brain cells like railroad ties holding tracks together the tracks that guide nutrients and other molecules throughout the cell in many neurodegenerative diseases tau proteins become abnormally sticky and tangled with other tau proteins compromising the delivery network we do know some factors associated with increased or decreased risk but their exact relationships with cognitive decline arent all certain things associated with a reduced risk for Alzheimers disease include physical activity a hearthealthy diet learning a second language later in life being social frequently interacting with people protecting your head and intellectual activities like crossword puzzles playing instruments reading board games education such activities may improve overall brain health and cognitive skills with a brain more resilient to damage should it come whatever the case theres a lot more we can learn it is incredible and exciting and a little scary to realize how much more we have to learn about the brain we know more about the orbital mechanics of distant binary stars than we do about the very mechanisms we use to know about them in the first place inner space is as mysterious and deep as outer space and of course between the two one doesnt even care if we exist while the other well the other is us the wobbly gel in our heads no stiffer than a good booger is fragile and still very much of a scientific frontier it looks like soft meat but it can not only think reason feel remember and lie it can also care for other people and the goopy wrinkled things inside their skulls it can be patient with them see them as people no matter how they change whether by growing up or growing way up supporting research caregivers and those diagnosed is something we can all do so thank you and as always thanks for watching terry pratchett famously said that right now the sword that will defeat Alzheimers is probably made of gold donations resources for the last few years Vsauce has donated to and supported the Alzheimers Association they are great people and they helped me

How Earth Moves,2016-06-13T14:48:34Z,21.616666666666667,30058820,667246,Music hey esauce Michael here do you have a best friend who is there for you 247 365 sorry thats not really good enough if your friend truly had your back they would be there for you 246 7 365 2421 891 also George Washington was born on February 22nd 1732 at least thats what were told however his family Bible says he was born on February 11th 1731 slash two so which is it Mr I cannot tell a lie oh and dont even ask about 1752 in Russia 1752 looked pretty normal but check out what the British Empire was up to that year nothing really out of the ordinary except Ember the second was followed by the 14th were 11 days just deleted where they go what happened then it is time to question time and how the Earth moves reconciling both of these things has led to some pretty strange things we all love timelapse videos of the Stars moving across the sky but really we are the ones who are moving tumbling Through the Universe on a giant wet Rock vehicle called Earth with a windshield called the sky as viewed from above the North Pole we spin counterclockwise West chases East I always remember this by thinking of the us as a weird main headed animal with Texas and Florida legs running forward but we dont just spin we also revolve around the sun on a plane tilted 234 de relative to our spin its kind of nauseating at this scale but from this perspective you can see that the sun rising and setting is just the Earth pointing you towards and then away from the Sun this motion causes your Sunrise your noon the moment when the sun is highest in your sky before your Sunset to more closely investigate this movement lets talk about meridians you are on one at this very moment your Meridian is just align from where where you are right now straight towards the North and South Poles its a line of longitude as opposed to the horizontal lines that lay flat when North or South is up that we call flatitude or actually latitude the sun is highest in the sky to you your noon when your Meridian is pointed right at the Sun a cool thing happens at this moment all Shadows around you point directly towards one of Earths poles unless youre on the subsolar point the subsolar point is the point on Earths surface directly below the Sun Its Always Somewhere you can check its current location online links as always in the description on The subsolar Point Shadows Fall straight down so they can easily disappear twice a year the subsolar point crosses over Hawaii the only place in in the US where it hits land and when it does it is called lahina noon meaning cruel Sun straight vertical objects look unnatural during this brief time like they dont belong as if they were photoshopped in without regard for reality in Honolulu a sculpture by isamu naguchi called skygate casts a twisted Shadow all day every day except during lahina noon when its shadow is a perfect Circle you may not live in a place where the sun ever appears directly overhead but once every earth rotation the subsolar point Falls somewhere on your Meridian making it noon for you the technical name for this noon for you is local apparent solar noon the clock on your wrist and the clock on your phone dont tell you your local apparent solar time because long ago we realized that if every Meridian had its own time a person just a few kilometers away seeing different shadows than you did would disagree with you on what time it was so towns adopted their own time now later on this trick was standardized and time zones as we know them today came about but thats not all we didnt like about shadowbased sundal time to explore deeper we have to begin by asking whats a day I mean obviously its just the time it takes the Earth to turn around once right but according to what everything else in space is moving in some way too the universe doesnt include a convenient sheet of graph paper at Absolute rest we can trace paths on the best we can do on that front is to look at very very far far far away Stars so far away like distant features of the landscape out the window of a moving car they barely move as Earth does now to them a Meridian on earth completes a trip around about once every 239 hours this is called a siderial day siderial means pertaining to the Stars even though the siderial day seems pretty clear its not what our calendars and clocks are based on because theres a near star whose position relative to us has a bigger effect on our lives the sun looking down on the North Pole at Earths counterclockwise spin the Earth also moves counterclockwise around the Sun after a siderial day the Earth has moved a bit along its orbit so some more rotation is required for the same Meridian to point back towards the sun again this longer definition of one rotation is what the modern calendar and clock is based on it is called the solar day but heres the thing exactly how long the Earth has to rotate to complete a solar day changes day to day our clocks are just based on the average amount of time this takes so throughout the year they fall ahead and behind the sun this is a solar graph a picture of the suns path across the sky every single day if our clocks actually told us local apparent solar time if you took a picture of the sky every day at noon you should get a line of suns but this is what really happens over the course of a year it will appear as though your clock is running slow and then fast and then slow again and then fast again this problem was known since at least ancient times even if its cause wasnt in order to reconcile the two the equation of time was constructed in this sense equation means to reconcile the equation of time was applied to what a clock said in order to compute the real time the solar time a sundial would show now some fancy clocks called equation Clocks Were Made that would do this for you but eventually we gave up we gave up and just said no the real time isnt what the sun says its what our inventions say now this transition was a big one it was human ity growing up it was like the first time you realize youre stronger than your parents we realized our time pieces were more regular and turned our backs on the time pieces nature had but what causes this disagreement in the first place as it turns out the answer revolves around revolving the way the Earth revolves around the Sun if the equator faced the sun all the time and the Earth always orbited at the same speed the subsolar point would just stay right there on the equator throughout the year and the amount of extra time spent rotating the Earth needed to do to finish a solar day would always be the same but those two things arent the case first of all the Earths orbit is slightly elliptical so its speed varies throughout the year when its moving around the Sun faster around the beginning of January the amount of extra turning time needed to complete the solar day is longer than when its further away from the Sun and moving more slowly theres more because the Earth is tilted the subsolar point is dragged throughout the year in a circle around Earth thats not the Equator so it changes Direction moving Northeast then leveling out and going Southeast before leveling out and going Northeast again during times of the year when the subsolar point is being dragged by Earths orbit mostly East it gains against Earths spin faster more time is required for the day to finish Now by coincidence we are alive at a time when both of these phenomena lengthen and shorten days at roughly the same time so they add up making September 18th almost a minute shorter than the longest day of the year December 22nd for northern hemisphere experience December has the shortest periods of daylight but the whole Solar day from sunrise to Sunrise is for everyone on Earth the longest of the year on December 22nd people in the north just spend most of it in darkness Earths Tilt it doesnt just affect how long a day is it also affects how long a year is this is because the Earths Tilt is what causes the season for the half of the earth tilted towards the Sun the same amount of solar radiation is spread across less space than it is on the other half so theres more heat energy laid down per area this causes what we call summer and winter for the other half the amount of time from one of these seasonal orientations of the earth to its occurrence again is called a solar year or a tropical year its a very useful way to define a year because it contains every single season exactly since its based on the very orientations that cause them but the problem is this the number of solar days that occur in a solar year is not a whole number its almost 365 but after that many solar days about a quarter of a day more happens before the solar year starts again this makes designing a a calendar more like designing a calend if your calendar only ever has 365 days in a year over time those dates will Drift from the seasonal positions they used to occur during unless H this extra quarter of a turn adds up to a full day after 4 years see March 1st is coming a Day Too Soon now so if we just delay march by adding an extra day at the end of February every 4 years a leap day were back on track leap days do not add days to your life youre still going to live the same number of them they just change what we call them but really who cares about being one day earlier every 4 years I mean one day isnt much youd hardly notice it but over time well if Americas Founders had declared not only independence from Britain but also from leap days and abolished them from happening today 240 years later their calendar would be a full 2 months ahead of Earths position putting Americas coldest winter days in April and its hottest summer days in October adding a day every 4 years is what the famous Julian calendar does introduced in 46 BC by Julius Caesar it was the de facto standardized West calendar for a very long time more than a millennium but its not perfect look closely leap days actually move the calendar just slightly too far each time because I lied 365 and a quar solar days dont occur within one solar year the real number is slightly less and fluctuates year to year based on on longterm changes to Earth and the suns movements which means adding one day every four years is just a Teensy wey too many by 1582 Julian calendar dates were 10 days behind the seasons compared to where they used to be now thats not bad 10 days and more than a millennium and a half but the Catholic Church cared because they wanted Easter to occur exactly when it used to centuries ago astronomers at the time time realized that if leap days pushed the calendar too far behind the seasons we would just need to celebrate fewer of them to fix the problem specifically we would need three fewer leap days every four centuries the rule they wrote to achieve this stated that every 4 years would continue to be a leap year except if it was divisible by 100 unless it was also evenly divisible by 400 this removes three every 400 years on October 4th Pope Gregory V 13th introduced this new calendar it took his name the Gregorian calendar he also undid the drift that had occurred since the early days of the Julian and declared on October 4th that tomorrow would be October 15th October 5th to the 14th never happened in 1582 in countries that listened to the pope it took the rest of the world centuries to hop on board England and its colonies like the soon to be United States of America adopted the Gregorian in September of 1752 by which point their Julian dates were off from the seasons by 11 days hence the disappearing of the 3rd through 13th when adopted the first of the year was also moved from March to January 1st this explains why George Washingtons birthday has two answers although more closely hitched to the seasons than the Julian the Gregorian calendar still isnt perfect its difference causes dates to become one day off from the seasons Every 3216 years other calendars have been proposed like the one standup maths calculated that drifts off even more slowly his video is a great watch by the way but enough of all of this lets sit back and enjoy Earths movement without trying to divide it up and name it as a caveat keep in mind that Earths oceans and liquid insides and other celestial bodies are always pulling and tugging and sloshing around minutely changing Earths movements their effect is measurable but difficult to notice at Big scales and also dont look like much in the short term short like the length of a human life looking from above the North Pole the equator SP counterclockwise at about 1670 kmph relative to the sun earth orbits counterclockwise at 108000 kmph along a path tilted 234 de to its spin within our local neighborhood of stars our entire solar system is drifting 70000 km per hour roughly in the direction of the bright star Vega in the constellation of lra and our solar system is part of a giant Galaxy called the Milky Way on a plane tilted about 60° approximately like the windshield of a car looking from above Earths north pole our entire solar system races clockwise around the galactic center at about 792 th000 km per hour our whole galaxy is also moving through the universe we know know this because when the universe was very young it was so hot electrons and protons jumped around and photons of light scattered constantly they couldnt travel very far before scattering again so the universe was opaque but then around 380000 years after the big bang the universe cooled just enough for electrons and protons to form hydrogen suddenly abruptly photons decoupled from this obstacle course and could travel relatively unencumbered the universe became transparent to light and since that moment those early photons have been propagating through space every day ancient photons that last scattered off this opaque fog at the moment of decoupling a light day further from where Earth currently is reach us they are part of the cosmic micro wave background radiation it is visible in every direction microwave because although they used to be more energetic the universes expansion has redshifted them now some parts of this radiation are more redshifted than others because of our own movement through the universe controlling for the movements weve already talked about relative to this infinite cooling baby picture of the universe the first and oldest detectable light we are headed riding along in the middle Milky Way in the direction that the constellations of Leo and Virgo are to us at a speed of 21 million kilm hour towards a thing we dont fully understand yet simply called the Great attractor this is how you on Earths surface are moving through the universe aboard spaceship earth okay now stop this is roughly 100 Years of

How To Count Past Infinity,2016-04-09T15:28:15Z,23.766666666666666,26295867,606055,hey Vsauce Michael here what is the biggest number you can think of a Google a Google Plex a million oplex well in reality the biggest number is 40 covering more than 12000 square m of Earth this 40 made out of strategically planted trees in Russia is larger than the Battalion markers on Signal Hill in Calgary the six found on the faven badges in England even the mile of Pi Brady unrolled on number file 40 is the biggest number on Earth in terms of surface area but in terms of amount of things which is normally what we mean by A number being big 40 probably isnt the biggest for example theres 41 well and then theres 42 and 43 a billion a trillion you know no matter how big of a number you can think of you could always go higher so there is no biggest last number except Infinity no Infinity is not a number instead its a kind of number you need infinite numbers to talk about and compare amounts that are unending but some unending amount some infinities are literally bigger than others lets visit some of them and count past them first things first when a number refers to how many things there are it is called a cardinal number for example four bananas 12 Flags 20 dots 20 is the cardinality of this set of dots now two sets have the same cardinality when they contain the same number of things we can demonstrate this equality by pairing each member of One set one to one with each member of the other same cardinality pretty simple we use the natural numbers that is 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on as Cardinals whenever we talk about how many things there are but how many natural numbers are there it cant be some number in the Naturals because thered always be one plus that number after it instead theres a unique name for this amount Alf null Alf is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and Alf null is the first smallest Infinity its how many natural numbers there are its also how many even numbers there are how many odd numbers there are its also how many rational numbers that is fractions there are that Mak may sound surprising since fractions appear more numerous on the number line but as caner showed theres a way to arrange every single possible rational such that the naturals can be put into a on toone correspondence with them they have the same cardinality point is Alf null is a big amount bigger than any finite amount a Google a Google Plex a Google Plex factorial to the power of Google Plex to a Google Plex squared times grams number Alf null is bigger but we can count past it how well lets use our old friend the super task if we draw a bunch of lines and make each next line a fraction of the size and a fraction of the distance from each last line well we can fit an unending number of lines into a finite space the number of lines lines here is equal to the number of natural numbers that there are the two can be matched one to one theres always a next natural but theres also always a next line both sets have the cardinality AL of null but what happens when I do this now how many lines are there Alf n  one no unending amounts arent like finite amounts there are still only Alf null lines here because I can match the naturals one to one just like before I just start here and then continue from the beginning clearly the amount of lines hasnt changed I can even add two more lines three more four more I always end up with only alol things I can even add another infinite alip of lines and still not change the quantity every even number compare with these and every odd number with these there is still a line for every natural another cool way to see that these lines dont add to the total is to show that you can make this same sequence without drawing new lines at all just take every other line and move them all together to the end its the same thing but hold on a second this and this may have the same number of things in them but clearly theres something different about them right I mean if its not how many things theyre made of what is it well lets go back to having just one line after an alfn sized collection What If instead of matching the naturals one to one we insist on numbering each line according to the order it was drawn in so we have to start here and number left to right now what number does this line get in the realm of the infinite labeling things in order is pretty different than counting them you see this line doesnt contribute to the total but in order to label it according to the order it appeared in well we need a set of labels of numbers that extends past the naturals we need ordinal numbers the first trans finite ordinal is Omega the lowercase Greek letter Omega this isnt a joke or a trick its literally just the next label youll need after using up the infinite collection of every single counting number first if you got Omega Place in a race that would mean that an infinite number of people finished the race and then you did after Omega comes Omega  one which doesnt really look like a number but it is just like 2 or 12 or 800 then comes Omega plus 2 Omega  3 ordinal numbers label things in order ordinals arent about how many things there are instead they tell us how those things are arranged they order type the order type of a set is just the first ordinal number not needed to label everything in the set in order so for finite numbers cardinality and Order type are the same the order type of all the Naturals is Omega the order type of this sequence is Omega  1 and now its Omega  2 no matter how long an arrangement becomes as long as its well ordered as long as every part of it contains a beginning element the whole thing describes a new ordinal number always this will be very important later on it should be noted at this point that if you are ever playing a game of who can name the biggest number and you considering saying Omega  1 you should be careful your opponents might require the number you name to be a cardinal that refers to an amount these numbers refer to the same amount of stuff just arranged differently Omega  1 isnt bigger than Omega it just comes after Omega but Alf null isnt the end why well because it can be shown that there are Infinities bigger than alol that literally contain more things one of the best ways to do this is with cantors diagonal argument in my episode on the bonak tarski Paradox I used it to show that the number of real numbers is larger than the number of natural numbers but for the purposes of this video lets focus on another thing bigger than alfn the power set of Alf n the power set of a set is the set of all the different subsets you can make from for example from the set of one and two I can make a set of nothing or one or two or 1 and two the power set of 1 two 3 is the empty set one and two and three and 1 and two and 1 and three and two and three and 1 2 3 as you can see a power set contains many more members than the original set two to the power of however many members the original set had to be exact so whats the power set of all the naturals well lets see imagine a list of every natural number cool now the subset of all say even numbers would look like this yes no yes no yes no and so on the subset of all odd numbers would look like this heres the subset of just 3 7 and 12 and how about every number except five or no number except five obviously this list of subsets is going to be well infinite but imagine matching them all one to one with a natural if even then theres a way to keep producing new subsets that are clearly not listed anywhere here we will know that weve got a set with more members than there are natural numbers a bigger infinity than Al null the way to do this is to start up here in the first subset and just do the opposite of what we see Zero is a member of this one so our new set will not contain zero next move diagonally down to ones membership in the second subset one is a member of it so it will not be in our new one two is not in the third subset so it will be in ours and so Music on as you can see we are describing a subset that will be by definition different in at least one way from every single other subset on this Alf null sized list even if we put this new subset back in diagonalization can still be done the power set of the naturals will always resist a on toone correspondence with the naturals its an Infinity bigger than Al of null repeated applications of power set will produce sets that cant be put into one toone correspondence with the last so its a great way to quickly produce bigger and bigger Infinities the point is there are more Cardinals after Alf null lets try to reach them now remember that after Omega ordinals split and these numbers are no longer Cardinals they dont refer to a greater amount than the last Cardinal we reached but maybe they can take us to one wait what are we doing Alf null Omega come on weve been using these numbers like theres no problem but if at any point down here you can always add one always can we really talk about it this endless process as a totality and then follow it with something of course we can this is math not science the things we assume to be true in math are called axioms and an axiom we come up with isnt more likely to be true if it better explains or predicts what we observe instead its true because we say it is its consequences just become what we observe we are not fitting our theories to some physical Universe whose behavior and underlying laws would be the same whether we were here or not we are creating this universe ourselves if the axioms we declare to be true lead us to contradictions or paradoxes we can go back and tweak them or just abandon them all together or we can just refuse to allow ourselves to do the things that cause the paradoxes thats it whats fascinating though is that in making sure the axioms we accept dont lead to problems weve made math into something that is as the saying goes unreasonably effective in the Natural Sciences so to what extent were inventing all of this or discovering it its hard to say all we have to do to get Omega is say Let There Be Omega and it will be good thats what Ernest zero did in 1908 when he included the Axiom of infinity in his list of axioms for doing stuff in math the Axiom of infinity is simply the Declaration that one infinite set exists the set of all natural numbers if you refuse to accept it thats fine that makes you a finitist one who believes only finite things exist but if you accept it as most mathematicians do you can go pretty far past these and through these eventually we get to Omega plus Omega except weve reached another caling going all the way out to Omega plus Omega would be to create another infinite set and the axium of infinity only guarantees that this one exists are we going to have to add a new Axiom every time we describe Alf null more numbers no the Axiom of replacement can help us here this assumption states that if you take a set like say the set of all natural numbers and replace each element with something else like say bananas what youre left with is also a set it sounds simple but its incredibly useful try this take every ordinal up to Omega and then instead of bananas put Omega Plus in front of each now weve reached Omega plus Omega or Omega  2 using replacement we can make jumps of any size we want so long as we only use numbers weve already achieved we can replace every ordinal up to Omega with Omega times it to reach Omega time Omega Omega squar were cooking now the axium of replacement allows us to construct new ordinals Without End eventually we get to Omega to the Omega to the Omega to the Omega to the Omega and we run out of standard mathematical notation no problem this is just called Epsilon KN and we continue from here but now think about all of these ordinals all the different ways to arrange alol things well these are well ordered so they have an order type some ordinal that comes after all of them in this case that ordinal is called Omega 1 now because by definition Omega 1 comes after every single order type of alfl things it must describe an arrangement of literally more stuff than the last Al I mean if it didnt it would be someone in here but its not the Cardinal number describing the amount of things used to make an arrangement with order type Omega 1 is Alf one its not known where the power set of the naturals falls on this line it cant be between these Cardinals because well there arent Cardinals between them it could be equal to Al one that belief is called the Continuum hypothesis but it could also be larger we just dont know the Continuum hypothesis by the way is probably the greatest unanswered question in this entire subject and today in this video I will not be solving it but I will be going higher and higher to bigger and bigger Infinities Now using the replacement Axiom we can take any ordinal weve already reached like say Omega and jump from Alf to ALF all the way out to ALF Omega or heck why not use a bigger ordinal like Omega squar to construct Alf Omega squar Alf omega omega omega omega omega omega our notation only allows me to add countably many omegas here but replacement doesnt care about whether or not I have a way to write the numbers it reaches wherever I land will be a place of even bigger numbers allowing me to make even bigger and more numerous jumps than before the whole thing is a wildly accelerating feedback loop of igging we can keep going like this reaching bigger and bigger Infinities From Below replacement and repeated power sets which may or may not line up with the alfs can keep our climb going forever so clearly theres nothing Beyond them right not so fast thats what we said about getting past the finite to omeg GA why not accept as an axiom that there exists some next number so big no amount of replacement or power setting on anything smaller could ever get you there such a number is called an inaccessible Cardinal because you cant reach it from below now interestingly within the numbers weve already reached a shadow of such a number can be found Alf null you cant reach this number From Below either all numbers less than it are finite and a finite number of finite numbers cant be added multiplied exponentiated replaced with finite jumps a finite number of times or even power set a finite number of times to give you anything but another finite amount sure the power set of a million million to a Google Plex to a Google Plex to a Google Plex is really big but its still just finite not even close to ALF null the first smallest Infinity for this reason alfl is often considered an inaccessible number some authors dont do this though saying an inaccessible must also be uncountable which okay makes sense I mean weve already accessed alfn but remember the only way we could is by straight up declaring its existence axiomatically we will have to do the same for inaccessible Cardinals its really hard to get across just how unfathomable the size of an inaccessible Cardinal is Ill just leave it at this the conceptual jump from nothing to the first Infinity is like the jump from the first Infinity to an inaccessible set theorists have described numbers bigger than inaccess each one requiring a new large Cardinal axium Asser its existence expanding the height of our universe of numbers will there ever come a point where we devise an axiom implying the existence of so many things that it implies contradictory things will we someday answer the Continuum hypothesis maybe not but there are promising directions and until then the amazing fact remains that many of these infinities perhaps all of them are so big its not exactly clear whether they even truly exist or could be shown to in the physical Universe if they do if one day physics finds a use for them thats great but if not thats great too that would mean that we have with this brain a tiny thing a septian times smaller than the tiny planet it lives on discovered something true outside of the Physical Realm something that applies to the real world but is also strong enough to go further past what even the universe itself can contain or show us or be and as always thanks for Music watching you wish never Music theres only Music just you wish Music never theres only one just one out there you wish another interesting fact about transfinite ordinals is that arithmetic with them is a little bit different normally 2  1 is the same as 1  2 but Omega  1 is not the same as 1 Omega 1 plus Omega is actually just Omega think about them as order types one thing placed before Omega just uses up all the naturals and leaves us with order type Omega one thing placed after Omega requires every natural number and then Omega leaving us with Omega  one as the order type,135.44179523141656,diagonalization,0.0,1.0,SrU9YDoXE88,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrU9YDoXE88
Math Magic,2016-02-05T16:44:01Z,19.516666666666666,13029756,408406,hey vauce Michael here if you rearrange the letters in William Shakespeare you can spell here was I like a Psalm in the King James Bible in Psalm 46 the 46th word is shake and the 46th word from the bottom is spear William Shake spear was 46 years old when the King James Bible was completed is this just a coincidence yes it is given enough searching enough words enough data you can eventually find and should indeed expect all kinds of neat coincidences its just probability heres another good example think of a card any card value and suit okay got it mentally focus on that card deliver it to my brain using ESP whoa huh I I got it here it is amazing right now think of another card are you ready okay its um well its this one right one more time think of a card really think about it and there it is impressed probably not but approximately seven of you might be you see there are only 52 cards if each card is equally likely to be thought of I had a one in 52 chance of guessing your card and about a one in every 140000 chance of doing so three times in a row if say a million people watch this video and play along after three tries you could expect about seven people to be left who had their imagined card pulled by me each time except not more than seven actually you see theres even more magic happening here and by magic I mean math when asked to arbitrarily think of a card Studies have shown that people tend to think of certain cards more often than others these are the results from a study of a few hundred people hearts are named a bit more often than the other suits the three cards I drew are the top three most often thought of but would it be more amazing if it actually was magic yes and no obviously magic as a performance is important it reminds us that being stupified and curious and humbled is fun without a visceral reaction to the unknown would we care to learn or study or investigate but yet explanations dont dull mystery they empower the mystified explanations arent ins theyre inces the start of an ability to use reassemble and reimagine new things out of what you now know heres a cool fact if you divide a deck of cards exactly in half there will always be the same number of red cards in one half as there are black cards cards in the other no matter how mixed up the cards were before you began its not magic though its just math think of it this way half of the cards in a deck are red so all the red cards could fit in one deck half this means that the number of cards in a half that arent red that is our black cards are necessarily equal in number to the Reds that must be in the other half knowing this you can devise an even neater trick like the really cool trick Matt Parker just showed off on his channel which you should subscribe to or like this one take an easier to count number of cards like say 10 and then Place another 10 cards on top but face up have a friend Shuffle the whole mess however they wish Cuts messy Cuts riffle smooshing they just cant cause any card to flip over then ask them to hand you the pack and behind your back even while blindfolded show them that you can separate the deck into two halves with the same number of face up cards every time over and over again all you have to do is Count out 10 cards the number of face up cards in one hand will equal the number of face down cards in the other flip one of the packs over and all of its face down cards will turn into face up ones taada the face up counts are now equal heres another trick that shows off some neat mathematical properties to help me with this trick Ive brought in Vanessa from the YouTube channel BrainCraft its an awesome Channel please go check it out but first check out this trick are you ready Im ready weve got 10 cards on the table five diamonds and five clubs Ace to five of each go ahead and put the clubs on top of the diamonds face up face up yep all right now I am going to mix these cards up all right and you are going to use your ESP abilities to get the cards paired up at the end you ready okay so Im going to mix these up take some off the top U move them to the bottom take some cards from the bottom and just like I dont okay Im going Im going to cut these as well let me know where you want to cut them okay there there there okay well cut the cards there and then Im going to take half of whats here five cards and deal them down one two three four five Im going set the other five right there now we have two piles and it is your turn to start swapping we got four swaps you can make and a swap involves taking the top card and moving it to the bottom okay all right now you can divy up these four swaps however you want you can do four here you can do two and two one and three whatever you want okay Ill do um three here and one here interesting yeah do you do it Ill do it one two two three and then one swap here good yes now were left with these two cards on top Im going to take them off and set them right here now three swaps uh all three on this pile ooh interes okay its your choice one two three and the top two cards I will peel off and we set aside all right now two swaps um two here two here mhm mhm all right one two once again the cards that are on top get peeled off and set aside one Swap and one here one here okay so Ill take these away and were left with two cards will they be the same will they be a match lets find out what okay whoo dont say okay yet because things arent okay something magic just happened weve got all of these cards we set aside and yet theyre all matches both Aces right there what are these both fives you also matched up the threes and of course the fours youre welcome thank you very much mhm but not you Vanessa you mathematics every time no matter how your friend decided to swap matching pairs will be together how well its all about Cycles if you have some cards in a particular order and you cut them somewhere doesnt matter where you will only change the positions of the individual cards but not the sequence the next card down will always be the next card in order with the whole thing wrapping back around it helps to think of the order not as a tower but as a clock now in the trick we just did each cards match is always just five cards away in the sequence because five happens to also be the number of cards in half the pack dividing the pack in half leaves pairs lined up no matter how weve cut the deck in the trick however we added a bit of extra Confusion by dealing the top half down onto the table 1 2 3 4 5 this has the effect of reversing its order now instead of having the same position in each pack pairs have mirrored positions the number of cards below any given card in the bottom pack is the number above it in the top pack this balance means that swapping all the cards above a Target in the bottom pack leaves it on top and swapping the number of cards below it from the other pack leaves its match on the other top of course the number of cards above and below a Target card in the bottom pack is just the number of all the other cards in that half which is the total amount in each pack minus one thats why with five cards in each pack we started with four swaps then after each pack had shrunk to four we did three swaps as long as the total number of swaps adds up to the pack total minus one well have matching pairs on top you can extend these facts about cyclical sequences to other tricks of your own imagining this is one of my favorite tricks it comes from Peter McOwen on the stem maths magic Channel trick time once again Im joined by Vanessa from BrainCraft and Ace through five of diamonds and Ace through five of clubs Vanessa could you please take the ace through five of diamonds and put them on top of the clubs but flip them over so theyre face down yes okay so we now have a kind of messy little deck here where all the black cards are face up and the reds are face down but were going to mix these up a lot we can even riffle Shuffle this um riffle Shuffle riffle Shuffle where you kind of divide it in half like this and then uh well its hard to do with few cards but you know you do this little like and then you do a little you know very fancy yeah thank you um where would you like me to cut these uh there right there okay cool now theres another way you can kind of mix Up and Deal cards its called the down over deal goes like this one card goes down the next goes over one goes down one goes over down over down over down over till youre done okay but now its your turn all right Im going to go two at a time and youre going to tell me whether these first two cards should be dealt down or should be turned over okay uh down down what about these two down over over these two down over over all right now lets go four at a time okay 1 2 3 four should these go down or over over over what about these four uh down down and the final two over over now we can do this as long as as often as you want I can keep doing this we can do two we can do four at a time how do you feel uh lets do it once more and do two at a time two at a time okay uh down down down down youre getting fast over down yeah okay all right now Im going to uh make two little piles like a little book all right one two one two one two one two one okay now Vanessa should I close this book like this or like this like this all right there we go now you had completely free choice here mhm you made a lot of different decisions somewhat arbitrarily but yet like oil and water the black and the red cards have separated and only the Reds or face up I knew this would happen but its not because of magic its because of math heres how it works the red cards all start out face down the black cards face up no amount of cutting or riffling will change the fact that Reds are face down and blacks are face up but when you down over deal you cause every other card to have its original facing Direction reverse first down over down over down over down over down over this alternating sequence is maintained through any number of cuts because its cyclical this is the key to the trick because when we alternatively deal Cards into book Hales one pile will contain cards reversed by the down over deal the other cards not reversed depending on how you close the book either all reversed cards are unreversed or all unreversed cards are reversed either way the original division by color comes back the swaps missed things up by introducing an illusion of control but in reality the swaps are what are known as a Hummer deal a swap flips the facing direction of the cards you flip but simultaneously moves them to the correct category preserving the sequence as long as you swap an even number of cards the facing direction of all of them is reversed but the positions they wind up in are still correct according to the sequence finally lets end with something popular that also sounds cool on the surface until you go deeper understand it better and it winds up being well even cooler the number of different ways 52 cards can be arranged theres obviously a lot the top card could be any card so theres 52 different possibilities any remaining cards can follow so there are 51 possibilities for the next card 50 for the third spot 49 for the fourth and so on multiplying all of these numbers together gives us how many unique ways 52 cards can be arranged 52 factorial is a gigantic amount so large in fact every time you shuffle a deck of cards well smoosh it for a few minutes or riffle it seven or more times chances are you have put those playing cards into an order that they have never been in in the entire history of cards or humans or the universe seriously this is because 52 factorial is 865  10 to the 67th in comparison the observable universe is only about 10 to the 18th seconds old even if you had been properly shuffling a deck every single second since the universe began 137 billion years ago you still to this day wouldnt have even come close to assembling every Arrangement possible but even that doesnt paint the whole picture of just how big 52 factorial is Scott Chapel wrote what in my opinion are some of the most mindboggling visualizations of the size of 52 factorial imagine setting a timer to count down 52 factorial seconds while the timer runs stand on the equator and wait 1 billion years after a billion years have passed take a single step forward and then wait another billion years before taking a second step and so on once you have walked all the way around the earth take a single drop of water out of the Pacific Ocean thats 500s of a milliliter and set it aside now continue walking at a rate of one step every billion years removing one drop after every Journey around the entire Earth and by the time the Pacific Ocean is completely empty put a single sheet of paper on the ground refill the ocean and keep going until the stack of paper reaches the Sun at that point how many seconds will be left on the timer will it be zero a few hundred a few billion no there will still be 8  10 to the 67 seconds left you have barely made a dent if you start all over again and do that whole thing a thousand more times you will only be a third of the way done luckily Scott has a great idea for how to pass the rest of the time if youre bored of paper and water and walking instead he says deal your self Five cards every billion years when you finally deal yourself a royal flush buy a lottery ticket if the ticket wins the lottery throw a single grain of sand into the Grand Canyon as soon as the Grand Canyon is completely full of sand remove 1 oce of rock thats about 28 G from Mount Everest by the time Mount Everest is leveled take a look at the clock this is what will be left do the whole royal flush lottery ticket Grand Canyon Mount Everest thing 256 more times and then and only then will your timer have reached zero that is how big 52 factorial is its pretty big but now think about this the number of possible people the number of different humans there could be is well even larger what that means is that even though you will probably die most people including possibly the smartest or funniest or most annoying possible person wont even get to die like you do they wont even get to be born so Im glad you were and as always thanks for watching oh dogs are Heart Music Heaven Music heart in heaven

Supertasks,2015-12-08T03:16:41Z,21.15,14059445,357837,Hey Vsauce Michael here Now one of my favoritetreats of the holiday season is Gabriels cake Its a super solidbased on Gabriels Horn that you can make right at home as long as your homeis infinitely large Okay all right Now the first thing you want to do is bake acake I prepared this cake earlier Its a real beautiful cake Its a little largebut I bet you I could eat that whole thing in a day if I tried Am I rightOkay now the second step is cut the cake in half Notice that while I cut this cake in half you dont add or create any new cake butthe surface area of the cake has increased It used to be completelycovered and now weve got two regions on the inside that arent covered The nextstep is to cut this half one of the halves in half Here we go Again the volume of cake onthe table is the same as it was in the beginning but the surface area is goingup As you may be able to guess the next step is going to be to cut one of thesequarters of the original cake in half Its getting pretty thin but all you have todo is keep this up  cutting halves in half and half and half and half forever andonce youve done that well youre almost there When you finish cutting stack thehalves on top of one another in order like this to create a beautiful tiereddessert Because you have an infinite number of thinner and thinner sliceswhen youre done stacking them the cakes vertical height will be endlessSuch a cake has an interesting mathematical property Its volume theamount of cake it contains is clearly no different than the amount you startedwith but its surface area is infinite Its a cake you can eat but not frostYou would need an infinite amount of frosting to cover the whole thing with a uniformcoat An object with finite volume but infinite surface area doesnt need tobe endlessly tall by the way There are bounded super solids like this cubewith an infinite number of smaller and smaller circular holesOf course building these objects in the real world comes with some obvious difficultiesOne is the fact that the amount of steps required to complete the construction ofGabriels cake or any other super solid is literally infinitely manyAnd infinity isnt a number that you know you eventually get toIt means unending There will always be a next step another piece to slice in half againBy definition an infinite sequence of tasks has no last task So you could neverfinish making a super solid Or could you Enter the Supertask What if instead of taking the sameamount of time to complete each step we accelerated as we worked and did eachstep in half the time as the last For example lets say you wanna makeGabriels cake in just two minutes Thats easy First cut the originalcake in half and then wait a minute before making the second cut Wait half a minute before making the third a quarter of a minute before the 4th and so onAlways waiting for half of whats left to pass before cutting again Since you can keepdividing in half forever there will always be another step Infinite actionswithin a finite amount of time is a supertask The strange thing of courseis that while supertasking no matter how many steps youve already completedthere will always be an infinite amount of steps ahead But yet when times upyou will have finished all of them What weve just described is similar to Zenosfamous paradox of the dichotomy in which the Greek hero Achilles runs a short racethat he can clearly finish I mean people finish races all the timebut how exactly its finished is a mystery Because first Achilles mustcover half of the races distance and then half of whats left and half againand again and again Since there will always be another half way point toreach the number of subdivisions infinite there is no final destinationafter which Achilles next stop is the finish line But yet Achilles obviously can finishHe somehow reaches them all despite the fact that during his journey he alwayshas an infinite number of steps left to reach Think about it this wayWhat if at each half way step along the way Achilles is required to hold up a flagAt even steps a blue flag and at odd steps a red flag Blue red blue redblue red the flags will alternate faster and faster But when Achilles finishesthe race which flag will he be holding up To be holding up either flag wouldseem to suggest that a largest number not only exists but is either even orodd Now to this it is often suggested that the real problem here is that Achillesisnt actually doing infinitely many thingsHes just taking a few strides or whatever A true supertask requires doinginfinitely many distinct actions Fair enough But even if Achilles ran therace in a staccato fashion stopping at each half way point for half as long as he waitedto the last one the scenario would still be sensical and logical and wouldcomplete in a finite amount of time It has even been shown how a staccatorunner could move to avoid discontinuous velocities and accelerationsThe point is fine infinite distinct actions are at leastlogically possible to do in a finite amount of time but only logicallyOnly as a mathematical abstraction Supertasks are obviously just products of ourimagination Because in the real world there must be some smallest amount ofspace andor time that cannot be meaningfully divided in half againOnce youre within one of these distances of the finish line the only possible next position you can have is the finish line That certainly seems fairAfter all its believed that in reality there is a smallest meaningful distance  the Planck length Any interactions between or observations of particlesmore accurate than this span make no sense within physics as we understand ittoday And the time it would take to travel a Planck length at the fastestspeed possible the speed of light is the Planck time So these seem to be thebriefest pieces of space and time any known force in the universe could actacross Whether that force is gravity or a force from Achilles leg musclesBut does that resolve the crisis or is it just a way of avoiding the problemaltogether by saying it doesnt matter because it wont be on the testAs John Earman has complained it seems to me unattractive to make the truth ofmathematical statements depend on the contingencies of spacetime structureMaybe Zenos dichotomy tells us less about motion and time and space and truththan it does about our impressive abilities to confuse ourselvesAnd thats what makes supertasks important Theyre a contact point in uneasyhandshake of sorts between the universe we live in and the brains inside usLets play around with some Theyre not all the same Some converge like Zenos dichotomyothers converge but in ways you may not expect and still others refuse tocooperate in any way They diverge A great example of a supertask whosebehavior diverges is Thomsons lamp a famous supertask devised by James F Thomson Imagine a lamp that can be turned on andoff as quickly as you desire What would happen if you turned such a lamp on andoff Zenoianly Well lets find out Just set a timer and turn the lamp on Then waitone minute and turn it off After half a minute turn it back on and then offagain after a quarter of a minute on again after an eighth of a minute and so on Waiting half as long to flip the switcheach time as you previously did Now as the number of switching grows without boundthe total time elapsed approaches just two minutes The lamp will be turned onand off an infinite number of times in just two minutesSo after two minutes will the lamp be on or off Well by the definition of infinitythere is no last step There is never a switching not followed by anotherSo the lamp cant be on because whenever its turned on it is immediately turned offin the next step and it cant be off because whenever its turned off itsturned on right afterwards Whats the answer Its easy to say something abouta supertask when its partial sums converge but when they just oscillate backand forth forever Hmmmm Zeno objects do this Imagine building a meterhigh cube As with all supertasks you construct at an accelerated paceFirst you put down a green half metre tall slab then a quarter metre tall slab thatsorange then a green eight metre slab then an orange 16th meter slab and so onuntil there are infinitely many layers of alternating color Now when you look at the cube from above what color will you see Orange green Well it cant be orangebecause every orange layer is covered by a green one And it cant be greenbecause every green layer is blocked by an orange one above it What if we had amachine display each digit of Pi in order at a supertask pace After itsfinite runtime what would be on the screenThe last digit of Pi Well thats impossible right But how could it be anything else A supertask allows us to exhaust an infinite sequence Paul Benacerraf delivered what is often considered thebest response to these confusions Is Thomsons lamp on or off Is the cube orange or green The answeris we dont know because these questions are incomplete Thomsons lamp could beon or off or broken The cube could appear orange or green or something elseBut the supertasks as stated dont let us figure out which I may as well askyou if a lamp hidden in a locked room is on or off Its definitely one or the otherbut I havent given you enough information to do anything but guess Supertasks likethese describe an endless sequence of tasks and then ask us about the endBut we cant determine an outcome because although there may be an end to theirduration there is no end no final member of their actionsThey must be reworded or coupled with extra assumptions in order to be solvedFor example if we assume that the switch used on Thomsons lamp can only be allthe way on or all the way off we cant determine where it is after the supertaskBut if the switch is say a bouncing ball that completes the circuitturning the lamp on each time it bounces on a metal plate an outcome can bedetermined If the physics here are ideal and the ball bounces half as high andhalf the time as it did on the previous balance its sequence ofbounce heights will turn the lamp on and off an infinite number of times in afinite amount of time Although this bouncing ball has no penultimate stateno secondtolast bounce it does have an ultimate state a final one resting on the plate The circuit will becomplete and the lamp will be on You can also describe a switch on Thomsons lamp that leaves it off Sometimes the next state after infinitely many isntparadoxical because of lack of information but because of a surprisingor nonintuitive discontinuity that occurs there The Ross–Littlewood paradoxis one of the greatest examples Imagine a giant urn that can hold an unlimitednumber of balls Now imagine that you have an unlimited supply of balls eachwith a unique natural number written on it All natural numbers in fact sincetheres no end to how many balls you have Now working at an accelerated Zenoian pace you move the balls to the urn 10 at a time but in a weird way At step one you placeballs number 1 to 10 in the urn but remove number 1 At step two a minutelater you place balls 11 to 20 in the urn and remove ball number 2 At step threeyou place balls 21 to 30 in the urn and remove ball 3 and so on Upon the completion of the supertaskhow many balls will be in the urn At first the answer seems obvious At eachstep you are adding 10 balls and subtracting 1 so a net of nine ballsis added each time 9  9  9  9 forever the series grows without end Infinite nines means infinite balls atthe end But heres the problem At each step the ball with that steps numberwritten on it is removed Ball 1 is removed at step one ball 2 was removedat step two ball 12googol is removed at step twelvegoogol Since there are anendless number of steps for any ball number there is a step number at whichit is removed So although the urns ball population grows without bound duringthe task after the supertask the number drops to 0 It gets weirder Heres a second seemingly identicalmethod Instead of beginning with balls 1 to 10 and then removing 1 begin withballs 1 to 9 Then write zero after the 1 on ball 1 For step two add balls 11 to 19 and draw a zero on ball 2 making it say 20 For every finite step both methodsresults in identical earned contents but after infinitely many steps the firstleaves us with no balls and the second leaves us with infinitely many ballswritten on which are all the natural numbers each followed by an infinitestring of zeros Both are discontinuous at infinity but dang in very different waysThe bigger question now becomes so what Who cares You will never have aninfinite number of balls and you will never have a large enough to urn tohold all of them You will never build a lamp that can turn on and off arbitrarily fast We cannot investigatetime or space past a certain smallness except when pretending so what are supertasks but recreational fictions entertaining riddles We can ask morequestions than we can answer so what Well heres what Neanderthals Neanderthals and humans usHomo sapiens lived together in Europe for at least five thousand yearsNeanderthals were strong and clever they may have even intentionally buried theirdead but for hundreds of thousands of years Neanderthals barely went anywhere They pretty much just exploredand spread until they reached water or some other obstacle and then stoppedHomo sapiens on the other hand didnt do that They did things that make no sensecrossing terrain and water without knowing what lay ahead Svante Pääbo hasworked on the Neanderthal genome at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropologyand he points out that technology alone didnt allow humans to go toMadagascar to Australia Neanderthals built boats too Instead he says theressome madness there How many people must have sailed out and vanished on thePacific before you found Easter Island I mean its ridiculous And why do you dothat Is it for the glory For immortality For curiosity And now we go to Mars Wenever stop Its ridiculous foolish maybe But it was the Neanderthals who wentextinct not the humans Maybe its only a fool who will perilously journey out towhat might not be there And maybe its only a fool who will ask about supertasksabout infinity But if you want to solve problems you dont just solve theones that are there you find more and make more and go after the impossibleones fostering a love and obsession with problems is how you solve problems Antoine de SaintExupéry wasnt amathematician but his advice fits nicely here If you want to build aship dont drum up people to collect wood and dont assign them tasks and workbut rather teach them to long for the endless immensity

Juvenoia,2015-11-01T22:24:58Z,23.166666666666668,9893061,261229,Hey Vsauce Michael here Skeletons are scary andspooky but you know what else is Teenagers Their attitude the way they dress andthe music they listen to Can you even call it music Pff kids these days But what are kids these days Whats with all the concern and whats a generation Why do we think that coevals groups ofpeople of roughly the same age act so much alike The sheer number of articlesand papers and internet posts published daily comparing then and nowboth sincerely and ironically is astonishing We cant seem to get enough about kidsthese days and just how different and awesome it was to be a kid back in thegood old days Generational labels make human historylook ordered and discreet instead of scary and messy They also have a delightfullysuspicious tendency to flatter those using them George Orwell put it wellEvery generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that wentbefore it and wiser than the one that comes after itTheres a name for this sentiment Juvenoia Sociologist David Finkelhorcoined the term It means an exaggerated fear about the things that influencekids these days Juvenoia is a concerned disappointment that because ofiPhones or the Internet or TV or rock music or those pesky horselesscarriages the world just isnt fit for kids like it used to beGenerational conflict really has been going on for that long After all honor thy your father and thy your mother was an ancient commandant for a reason In the 4th century BC Aristotleremarked that youths mistakes are due to excess and vehemence they think theyknow everything Heres an engraving from 1627 admonishing the now compared tothe ways of old In the early 1900s Romain Rolland complained thatthe new generation of young people were quote passionately in love with pleasureand violent games easily duped New people and the direction society isheaded in has always been seen with somedisapproval Xkcd famously collected a brief history of juicy examples In 1871the Sunday Magazine published a line that may as well have been written todayabout texting Now we fire off a multitude of rapid and short notesinstead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper And theJournal of Education in 1907 lamented that at a modern family gatheringsilent around the fire each individual has his head buried inhis favorite magazine The point is theres nothing new under the Sun Not even theSun in fact The Sun is believed to be a third generation star This constantcycle of generation clashing can sometimes sound like a broken recordAre these commentaries really providing insight into the minds of future leaders orprematurely judging a coeval based on how it acts as teens Despite theincessant concerns otherwise the proverbial kids these days seem to bebetter off than ever before Drug use is down exercising is up math and writing proficiency haveincreased crimes committed by young people have decreased hate commentsreported by children have dropped the number of 9th to 12th graders who havebeen in fights has dropped and the number of teens who fear attacks at schoolhas dropped But still juvenoia persists But why Well it kinda makes sense I meanchildren are the future of a species so its reasonable to assume that naturewould select for features in a species that cause adult members to prefer theway they were raised and distrust anything different After all parents bydefinition were a reproductive success for the species They made new members Sowhatever choices and influences brought them to that point must have been goodenough Any deviation from that could be a problem So worrying about the young mayhave been naturally selected just like eyes and fingers and breathing air andpooping But heres the thing Our brains dont accurately remember thepast or apply memories fairly or rationally That kind of thinking has aplethora of interesting causes First at a social level concerns for and aboutthe youth are often exaggerated because exaggerating is effectiveYoull generate greater mobilization around the cause if you can convince people thatwere on the cusp of a crisis here folks Also our increasingly connected worldmeans more potential contacts with people outside the family the tribethe neighborhood Even though juvenile problems often involve people thejuvenile already knows stranger danger is a more powerful fear My kids havegood friends who are good influences so why should I worry can be replaced todaywith even so people you dont know are threats so worry Other reasons forjuvenoia are personal and often its not so much the world thats changed its youAre drivers today really worse than they were when you were young or do yousimply have new responsibilities and experience that makes you more aware ofdangers that were always there We remember the past abstractly There justisnt enough room in our brains or a vital need for complete voracity whenrecalling things Thus we are more likely to remember the general way we felt in thepast without the petty annoyances more salient still for the presentSecondly loss aversion and the endowment effectPeople perceive a loss as greater than an equal gain In one famous study when asked howmuch they would pay for a coffee mug people gave prices that weresignificantly lower than what people given the mug first said theyd bewilling to sell it for This may play a role in how we valuewhat we already have  our memories and favorites  over whats new Theres even neuroscience backing upwhy new stuff seems so bad to you Its called the reminiscence bumpStorage of autobiographical memories memories about yourself increases during times of change Incidentally this is why you rememberexciting things as lasting longer than they really did but rarely remembertimes of boredom in detail Ive discussed before the ways in which thiscauses us to feel like time slowed down during particularly quick butsignificant events Anyway adolescence and early adulthoodparticularly ages 10 to 30 are major times of change Many important thingshappened during those years that define your identity So its no surprise thatalong with things that have happened recently memories from this bump period aregreater in number and more emotional The books and songs and movies and slangwords and behaviour you loved and used during this time correlates quite well with what you willwhen youre older remember the most fondly As we can see juvenoia is naturalIn fact a healthy dose of it is important There are plenty of things weshould be fired up about improving Whats sometimes lost though whenexplaining that juvenoia occurs in every generation is the fact that the natureof juvenoia hasnt always been the same The generation gap of antiquity or ofthe 1300s wasnt the same as it is today The more rapid speed of change may beone reason but another is the appearance of a new type of creature around theturn of the last century  the teenager The word teenager wasnt even used as astage of life until 1922 John Savages Teenage is a fantastic read on how humansociety sort of accidentally invented the teenager You see as factoriesgenerated new unskilled jobs young people could acquire somethingneat  their own money Suddenly marketers realized that products could be made forthe youth They were no longer stuck with what their parents decided on Alsothe surge in immigration at the time highlighted for a new generation the viewthat identity wasnt something youre stuck with Its fluid personal decided Furthermore calls forcompulsory education around that time that is making it the law that children go to school further solidified the segmentedidentity of children by forcing them out of the world at large and into commonplaces surrounded mainly by their coevals In that environment they coulddevelop behaviors and opinions and culture shared just with themselves Compulsory schooling also increasedliteracy in adolescence which gave them all the more power to hear stories writtenfor them and about them in books they could buy with their own money Kids these days suddenly werent just younghumans waiting for life experience they were separate beings with their ownculture and voice A fact that caused juvenoia to change from the edibleskirmishes of the past into the fullfledged panics we know and lovetoday This brings us to a bigger question though Sure you may say that makes sense buteven someone who didnt grow up in this society could plainly see that in theold days culture wasnt as dumbed down as it is today Things used to be made by the elites forthe elites Now theyre made for the masses who demand sensational atavisticpablum instead of rational critical thought like scholars and well you know meThose examples sure are convincing but the plural of anecdote isnt dataYou can pick different examples and argue the opposite point Mozart wrote poemsabout farts There is amazing work and there is simple work made at all times inhistory In fact as Steven Johnson points out in Everything Bad is Good for You ifanything when given the chance to buy or participate as they choose the tendencywe find in humans is a preference for more cognitive demands for smarterentertainment What it takes to keep up with the increasing density andintricacies of narratives in media these days is impressive To be fair of coursebeneath the stimulating organization there is no substance anymore right I mean heres what one noted critic said oftodays easy brainless mass culture We do not turn over the pages in search of thoughtdelicate psychological observation grace of style charm ofcomposition but we enjoy them like children at play laughing and crying at the images beforeus Wait sorry thats something literary critic G H Lewes wrote about Dickens in1872 The point is taste is subjective Art to 1 percent is garbage to anotherYou may dislike the language or violence or morals depicted on TV today but theresno denying the fact that entertainment including popular entertainmentis requiring more and more thinking on the viewers part than ever beforeJohnson created this visual comparing narrative threads in episodes of different TVshows over time and this shouldnt be surprising Our brains crave stimulationA lump that sits and stares into space isnt naturally selected form in the same wayas a brain that learns and synthesizes and organizes Now that entertainment canbe made for niche audiences and watched and rewatched on demand and discussed ad nauseam online that natural desire can be sated by media Johnson goes so faras to say that reruns have made us smarter Theyve enabled entertainment tobe made that rewards being watched and thought about over and over againThe names and stories and relationships and dramas people today have to keepstraight in their heads to be functioning consumers of modern mediaare impressive by historical standards and affect more of us than ever beforeJohnson points out that in his time Dickens was only read by 025 of hiscountrys population while today innovative shows like The West Wing orThe Simpsons easily reach twenty times thatproportion Okay but how about this Where are the Mozarts and Dostoyevskysof today Well theyre probably here but thereputation of Dostoyevsky is built by time something the judgments of contemporaryartists havent had enough of yet Finally when it comes to judging worksthat merely tease the base emotions lets not forget the quote from Unamuno Ive discussed beforeMore often have I seen a cat reason than laugh or weep Cats and humans are curious and canproblem solve but only humans can laugh at fart videos So what really ought we be treasuringTheres a problem here though Although writers like Johnson have been able toput forth convincing arguments that movies and TV have been serving more andmore cognitive complexity theyve failed to find the same evidence for pop musicNearly all studies on the subject have found that unlike other forms of popularmedia pop music has in fact become since the 1950s less complex in itsstructure and more homogeneous Mathematically speakingmore pop songs today sound alike than they used toWhats up with that music Well heres the thing Pop music is justone type of music being made today and its role what its its listeners want fromit and who they are are much more specific than the widerspectrum of genres a movie theater or Netflix caters A pop song needs toprovoke quick mood stick into your head and fit anticipation and pay off into afairly regular amount of time There are only so many ways to do that So perhapspop music producers have simply gotten better at scratching the specific itchtheyre challenged to scratch I mean imagine criticizing doctors for usingpenicillin nowadays Uh back in the good old days treatment was innovative There were leeches and onion plasters amputationand good luck charms Now its all just penicillin penicillin penicillinIts all the same Criticizing popular music for all sounding the same ignores thesameness of every pop songs goal But what about generations What are they exactlyI mean humans dont have babies all at once every twenty years or so New peoplejust keep showing up about four more every second But that said there are biologicalchanges humans go through as they grow and age roughly creating a few lifestages Alright Now this list of generations goes all the way back to themid 1400s It applies mainly to the western world especially the US and isthe work of William Strauss and Neil Howe whose landmark 1991 bookGenerations contains one of the most influential and ambitious generationtheories of our time These are the guys who coined term millennial by the wayThey set forth and have continued to expand a theory that society follows apredictable cycle of moves each lasting about 20 years  about how long it takesfor everyone in a life stage to move on to the next The social mood and the common lifestage a coeval experiences it during are what distinguishes one generation fromthe next Strauss and Howe call each social mood a turning A turning describes the waysociety will act by either establishing accepting challenging or fracturing inlieu of established customs To illustrate the cycle lets start justafter the American Civil War in the socalled Gilded Age Here we findAmerican society in the first turning what they call a high This is a twenty yearperiod when society is largely in agreement about the direction it wantsto go in because it recently coalesced in the face of a crisisInstitutions are strong and thus young adults are cautious and conformist But then people tire of socialdiscipline and call for reform a period of awakening occurs The majorityconsensus is attacked in the name of greater and broader individual autonomyThe distrust in institutions left in the wake of an awakening leads to the nextturning an unraveling where in place of broad cultural identity moral crusadespolarize society over what should come next Finally a renewed interest in consensusthat responds to crisis by banding together occurs Societys mood shifts toa belief that coalescing and building together are the answer The cycle thenstarts again with a high  the majority agrees on societys directions andinstitutions strengthened during the crisis until people tire of thismajority structure and an awakening leaves those institutions week and armedwith less public consensus This is followed by an unraveling whereindividuals polarize over moral issues and the youth raised in the previous twoatomizing moods feel alienatedWhich brings us to well today StraussHaus theory if true tells usthat this will be an era where society will band together and buildinstitutions from the ground up in the face of crisis Its not clear what thatcrisis will be but if their theory has predictive power the climax of thatcrisis will occur in 2025 The whole theory is a great way to learn about youas history Al Gore once even gave a copy ofGenerations to every member of Congress But it is unscientific and unfalsifiableYou can find a pattern in anything if you pick and choose the right examples As for the usefulness of itsgeneralizations well Philip Bump points out that the US Census Bureau only recognizesone official distinguishable generation Baby boomers Do you think you are aGeneration X a millennial Generation Z Well thats fine he says you call yourselfwhatever you want Its all made up The baby boomers are a cohort significantin that no matter where they were born or who they are their size alone determines a lot abouttheir path But other population segments based solely on birth year just dontmean much A more useful way to divide them into cohorts might focus on some other lessagerelated trade that correlates better with behavior Wealth region sexuality etc Regardless of its accuracy theres onething generational theory and its critics do at least agree onPeople change as they age and the larger society surrounding people influencesthe degree to which generations feel conflict So generational thinking is akind of guidance Its one that helps take us on a journeymanned by an ever changing and changing crew Some crews are different thanothers for sure and you need worry and concern to stay safe But at the end ofthe day its still the same boat and the same waters Generations and juvenoiaare like what Picasso said about art  they are lies that tell the truth And as always thanks for watching Heres a bonus While doing research I found a websitethat will allow you to find what word was first used the year you were born Itspretty cool Its also a

Messages For The Future,2015-09-24T01:29:24Z,22.2,25488164,591467,Hey Vsauce Michael here This is Earth asseen from Saturn That is us right there And if you look closely ok see thislittle protuberance Thats the Moon This image was taken by the Cassinispacecraft on July 19th 2013 at 2127 Coordinated Universal Time The thing isNASA gave the public advanced warning of when it would be taken which meansthat this image of Earth was the first ever taken from space that some people onEarth were actually posing for Our planet looks so small insignificant fragileI recently attended the premiere of Sky 1s upcoming You Me and the Apocalypsewith some cool YouTubers and it got me thinking In the show the characters findout that theyre only 34 days left before a comet smashes into Earth thats likelyto end humanity They all react in different interesting ways but whatwould I do if I found out that there were only 34 days of human history left Ok my first prioritywould be to get back to America to be with my family But after that I dont really have abucket list Except that is exactly what I would want to spend my last few weeksdoing Making a list to put in a bucket that I would then send far out intospace away from Earths impending vaporization The list would containinformation about us all Earthlings So that if libraries and monuments andYouTube videos were all destroyed a record would still exist somewhere of what and who we were Like a stonethrown into a lake the ripples your life causes last long after you vanishthe tree you planted is climbed by future generations the books you donated informfuture readers But what if its not just your stone that vanishes but the entire pondPerhaps its arrogance or vanity but getting cosmic messages in a bottle outthere before the end diversifies our archive and gives a better chance forfuture alien visitors or whatever is left of humanity to find out that wewere once here to show what we learned Maybe even to warnfuture life forms of what we did or what we didnt prepare for We have alreadysent some messages about humanity out there beyond Earth and if Earth iscompletely destroyed those messages will be all thats left of us What are theyOk first things first How do you write something for the future I meanthe distant future The message might not be found for millions of years or billionsIt might be discovered by an audience thats completely different not only inlanguage but in senses What if they cant see or hear or feel or tasteor smell like we do or at all What if their bodies destroy the very materialwe write the message on What language do you even write it in Well in general mathand physics which are believed to be the same everywhere in the universehave been what we write outer space bound messages in Like the Arecibo message written byFrank Drake Carl Sagan and others which was blasted towards the M13 star clusterin 1974 Its composed of a semi prime number of binary digits conveying someinfo about us and it should reach the centerish of the M13 cluster in about25000 years at which point if something intelligent livesthere and detects it they can respond and their response will return to usanother 25000 years later We wont be around for that But Earth has also beenbroadcasting its radio and TV signals into space Currently its about 200lightyears in diameter Compared to the Milky Way its about this big Aliens withinthat bubble could tune in and listen to programs we sent out through ourairwaves but these signals thin out as the bubble expands Across very largedistances they may be essentially impossible to tune into Maybe a physical time capsule would bemore permanent but it cant be buried on Earth if Earth is about to be ravagedA time capsule in orbit might be smart like LAGEOS1 a satellite put into orbitin 1976 that allows for very precise laser measurements of positions on Earth but also contains a plaque designed by Carl Sagan upon which is written the numbers 1 to 10 in the binary and the arrangement of the Earths continents 250 million years ago today and their estimated arrangementin 84 million years which is how long we believe the satellites orbit will be stable Drag caused by the thin atmosphere up where it orbits and influences like solar activity will eventually cause it to fall back downto Earth but its plaque will serve as a time capsule  a message from us today towhatever happens to be alive or intelligent here on Earth 8 million years in the futureTo put that in perspective the pyramids were only built about 5000 years ago8 million years ago there werent even humans on the Earth The latest common ancestor ofhumans and chimpanzees was around though 8 million years from today when LAGEOSreturns what will intelligent life on Earth look like If Earths surface isbarren of life at that point LAGEOS1 will be alone But what aboutsatellites in geostationary orbits These orbits are far enough out that theyremuch safer from atmospheric drag and could remain above Earth much muchlonger than satellites like LAGEOS These satellites are our pyramids Theyresmaller than monuments built by past civilizations but impervious to anythingthat might go wrong on the less stable surface of our planet If alienarchaeologists come by in a billion years or so these satellites may be whattheir alien encyclopedias use as the picture for the humans article So far wehave erected about 450 of these geostationary monumentsWhen such a satellite wears down and ceases to be operational it takes a lotof energy to slow it down so it can move out of the way and fall to Earth to burn up inthe atmosphere So instead theyre usually pushed into whats known as agraveyard orbit A shell around the planet where they canbe part without interfering with important operational satellitesIts fitting that we call these graveyard orbits because tombs are often the moststunning things we have from previous civilizations These graveyard orbits aretombs in a way Not for kings but for machines Junkyards that will outexist thevery societies and people they so largely define Luckily a few containmore than just our craftsmanship They also contain a record like EchoStar XVIa communications satellite launched into geostationary orbit in 2012 Aboard it is asilicon disc created by artist Trevor Paglen containing 100 images ofEarth and Earthlings Now unlike LAGEOS EchoStar XVI will likely remain in orbitfor billions of years safe from discord and change down hereBut heres the thing What if our entire solar system is lost Or what if life outthere doesnt decide to ever visit our system Well in that case we have sentinterstellar messages At this moment so far there are 11 distinct human madethings on trajectories out of the solar system into interstellar spaceTheyre all related to five probes Pioneer 10 Pioneer 11 Voyager 1 andVoyager 2 and New Horizons the thing that recently made a Pluto flybyThese objects are our most distant hellos Over the next ten thousand millionbillion years theyll pass close enough to other star systems maybe even planetsto possibly be discovered by other intelligent life forms We had theforesight to include special messages on these probes The Pioneer plaques areattached to Pioneer 10 and 11 which launched in the early 1970swere the first humanmade objects to ever be sent on a trajectory to not justleave Earth but to leave the solar system entirely If discovered by otherlife out there these plaques designed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagancould be our first chance to say hello we exist or depending on how longhumanity lasts our only chance to say Hello we existed This is what we were But willthe plaques makes sense to aliens Many humans scientists have had troubledeciphering their meaning but heres what they say At the bottom is a map ofour solar system with a path showing the Pioneer probe itself and where it camefrom This element has been particularly criticized for being human centricI mean an arrow Whos to say aliens will know that this depicts a path and not somestructure in our solar system Also its an arrow Arrows might convey this wayonly two civilizations that hunted or developed pointy projectiles Anyway Up here we define units You cant tell aliens about humans or Earth by usingseconds kilometres or light years because we made those measurements upInstead the plaque uses hyperfine transitions to communicate distances and timeThe hope is that curious intelligent life forms who find thiswill understand that this is a hydrogen atom  one proton one electron Hydrogen isthe most abundant element in the universe so hopefully its propertieswill be a common point of understanding Now sometimes if youve got enoughhydrogen around you can catch atoms in the heap transitioning between particleswith parallel spins and antiparallel spins Now whenever this transitionhappens electromagnetic radiation is released with a period of about 27nanoseconds and a wavelength of about 21 centimetres Its hoped thataliens equate this tick mark with these two units of measurement For examplethe woman is said to be in binary eight of these units tall 21 centimetres timeseight is a 168 centimetres You would think that puttingthe probe itself behind them for scale would be enough to show our sizebut having both might help solidify the connection This diagram is meant to showwhere we live We are in the middle The direction and proportional length ofthe lines show where distant pulsars are A tickmark near the ends of each lineshows the third direction behind or in front of the plaque that the line shouldgo in In binary next to each line is the period of each pulsar Again in thetime units described above If aliens make this connection they could possiblymatch the periods with the correct pulsars in real life triangulate our position and come say hello Also since the period of a pulsarchanges over time they could use our observed periods to date back how longago this plaque was made So thats how the plaque works It kind of feels likewere just sending out a bunch of science homework to space but how elsecan you find common ground with something that might not resemble you inany way you could even imagine Despite heading out first the Pioneer plaques are not the firstphysical messages made by us to go interstellar That title belongs to Voyager 1Currently moving at 17 kms it is the most farout thing humans have ever made Literally In about 40000 yearsboth Voyagers will pass within less than two light years of other starsIf aliens find them or if future humans find them a golden record is attached toboth that contains information about humanity The record is made of goldplated copper with an aluminum cover containing some uranium 238 Given itshalflife smart aliens could analyze it to determine how long ago the record wasmade On the record is the inscription to the makers of music All Worlds All TimesThe record contains 116 images as well as audio and video recordings of humansanimals songs and greetings in fifty five languages Printed on the record areinstructions for playback and info about us The hydrogen hyperfine transitionunit definition and the Pulsar map included on the Pioneer plaques but therecord also comes with a stylus and platter to play it Instructions for usingthe stylus are on the record This is a picture of the stylus being usedcorrectly and then in binary using the transition units the record tells thealiens that the stylus should go around the record once every 36 secondsto play back correctly and in total should take about one hour to do soFor the video portion instructions are given in a circle The first videoimage is displayed so they know they did it right Also included on the record is a messagefrom thenpresident of the United States Jimmy Carter Theres somethingvulnerable about the message Its delivered to an unknown recipientlike when someone in a horror movie asks into the darkness Is anyone there Hello This is what it says We cast this messageinto the cosmos It is likely to survive a billion years into the future when ourcivilization is profoundly altered and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed Of the two hundredbillion stars in the Milky Way galaxy some perhaps many may have inhabitedplanets and space faring civilizations If one such civilization interceptsVoyager and can understand these recorded contents here is our messageThis is a present from a small distant world A token of our sounds our scienceour images our music our thoughts and our feelings We are attempting tosurvive our time so we may live into yours We hope someday having solved theproblems we face to join a community of galactic civilizations This recordrepresents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vastand awesome universe Are these messages enough Should we send more Well why not sendeverything We could if we sent the Library of Babel Its a website built by Jonathan Basilethat currently offers everything that has been or could be written Seriously Divided into pages it is builtto produce and locate on demand any 3200 character combination of English lettersand the comma space and period Basile has organized it all into hexagonshapedrooms each with four walls of books containing five shelves with 32 volumesof four hundred and ten pages each Everythings arranged in a pseudorandomfashion so browsing the online library feels like a treasure huntHeres how it works Each page is given a unique sequentialpage number in base 10 The text on each page is encased inside this number An algorithm Basile created uses thepage number as a seed to generate a unique big number That output is thenconverted into base 29 so that it can be represented using every letter in theEnglish alphabet as well as the comma the space and the period This is whatyou see on the page Basile has made sure that the algorithm will produceevery possible combination and the same page number will create the same outputevery time Which means that what is on each page isalready predetermined So in a way every page already existsIt only needs to be looked up And here is the really mind blowingthing The contents of a page can be converted to base 10 sent through theinverted algorithm and turned into the exact page number theyre found on Its atruly eerie experience because you can find the permanent location for any 3200character text You can find in this library the description of your birthevery possible description of your death every poem every joke every lieanything that could be said can be found on this site This thing blurs the line between inventionand discovery Did you really discover or invent that thing if its description already existed10 to the 5000 different pages are offered by the Library of BabelIn comparison there are only 10 to the 80 atoms in the observable universeI searched for what Ive just said and sure enough in this hexagon on this wallthis shelf and this volume on this page its there Hello But deep down we feel like theres adifference between this program permuting something unknowingly anda person actually meaning it intending it saying it because they wanted to withagency We use a finite number of symbols to say things For that reason a library ofevery finite combination of those symbols can be madebut just because it can be made doesnt need it has been said That isthe power we have Perhaps you and I were born too late to explore the world andtoo early in history to explore the stars but we were born at just the righttime which is pretty much all times ever to explore language To explore what can besaid What should be said What should we send out to space What thatcant

The Zipf Mystery,2015-09-15T21:18:00Z,21.083333333333332,27183980,662630,Hey Vsauce Michael here About 6 percent ofeverything you say and read and write is the the  is the most used word in theEnglish language About one out of every 16 words we encounter on a daily basisis the The top 20 most common English words in order are the of and to a in is I that it for you was with on as have but be theyThats a fun fact A piece of trivia but its also more You see whether the mostcommonly used words are ranked across an entire language or in just one book orarticle almost every time a bizarre pattern emerges The second most usedword will appear about half as often as the most used The third one third asoften The fourth one fourth as often The fifth one fifth as often The sixth one sixthas often and so on all the way down Seriously For some reason the amount oftimes a word is used is just proportional to one over its rank Wordfrequency and ranking on a log log graph follow a nice straight line A powerlawThis phenomenon is called Zipfs Law and it doesnt only apply to English It alsoapplies to other languages like well all of them Even ancient languages we havent beenable to translate yet And heres the thing We have no idea whyIts surprising that something as complex as reality should be conveyed bysomething as creative as language in such a predictable way How predictableWell watch this According to WordCountorg which ranks words as found in theBritish National Corpus sauce is the 5555th most common English wordNow here is a list of how many times every word on Wikipedia and in theentire Gutenberg Corpus of tens of thousands of public domain books showsup The most used word the shows up about 181 million times Knowing these twothings we can estimate that the word sauce should appear about thirtythousand times on Wikipedia and Gutenberg combinedAnd it pretty much does What gives The world is chaotic Things aredistributed in myriad of ways not just power laws And language is personal intentional idiosyncratic What about theworld and ourselves could cause such complex activities and behaviors tofollow such a basic rule We literally dont know More than a century ofresearch has yet to close the case Moreover Zipfs law doesnt justmysteriously describe word use Its also found in city populations solarflare intensities protein sequences and immune receptors the amount of trafficwebsites get earthquake magnitudes the number of times academic papers arecited last names the firing patterns of neural networks ingredients used incookbooks the number of phone calls people received the diameter of Mooncraters the number of people that die in wars the popularity of opening chessmoves even the rate at which we forget There are plenty of theories about whylanguage is zipfy but no firm conclusions and this video doesnt contain adefinite explanation either Sorry I know thats a bummer since we appear to likeknowing more than mystery But that said we also ask more than we answer Solets dive into Zipfs ramifications some related patterns some possibleexplanations and the depth of the mystery itselfZipfs law was popularized by George Zipf a linguist at Harvard University It is adiscrete form of the continuous Pareto distribution from which we get thePareto Principle Because so many realworld processes behave this waythe Pareto Principle tells us that as a rule of thumb its worth assuming that 20 ofthe causes are responsible for 80 of the outcome like in language where the mostfrequently used 18 percent of words account for over 80 of word occurrencesIn 1896 Vilfredo Pareto showed that approximately 80 of the land in Italywas owned by just twenty percent of the population It is said that he laternoticed in his garden 20 percent of his pea pods contained eighty percent of thepeas He and other researchers looked at other datasets and found that this 8020imbalance comes up a lot in the world The richest 20 of humans have 827 ofthe worlds income In the US 20 of patients use eighty percent of healthcare resources In 2002 Microsoft reported that 80 of the errors andcrashes in Windows and Office are caused by 20 of the bugs detected A commonrule of thumb in the business world states that 20 of your customers areresponsible for 80 of your profits and eighty percent of the complaints youreceive will come from 20 of your customers A book titled The 8020 Principleeven says that in a home or office 20 of the carpet receives 80 percent ofthe wear Oh and as Woody Allen famously said eighty percent of success is justshowing up The Pareto Principle is everywhere which is good By focusing on just 20 percent of whatswrong you can often expect to solve eighty percent of the problems A varietyof different unrelated factors cause this to be true from case to case but ifwe can get to the bottom of what causes some of them maybe well find that one or more ofthose mechanisms is responsible for Zipfs law in language George Zipfhimself thought languages interesting rank frequency distribution was a consequenceof the Principle of Least Effort The tendency for life and things to followthe path of least resistance Zipf believed it drove much of human behavior andhypothesized that as language developed in our species speakers naturallypreferred drawing from as few words as possible to get their thoughts out thereIt was easier But in order to understand what was being said listeners preferred larger vocabulariesthat gave more specificity so that they had to do less work The compromisebetween listening and speaking Zipf felt led to the current state of languageA few words are used often and many many many words are used rarely Recent papers have suggested that havinga few short often used predictable words helps dissipate information load densityon listeners spacing out important vocab so that the information rate is moreconstant This makes sense and much has been learned by applying the leasteffort principle to other behaviors but later researchers argued that forlanguage the explanation was even more simple Just a few years after Zipfsseminal paper Benoit Mandelbrot showed that there may be nothing mysteriousabout Zipfs law at all because even if you just randomly type on a keyboard youwill produce words distributed according to Zipfs law Its a pretty cool point andthis is why it happens There are exponentially more different long wordsthan short words For instance the English alphabet can be used to make 26 oneletter words but 26 squared 2 letter words Also in random typing whenever thespace bar is pressed a word terminates Since theres always a certain chance thatthe space bar will be pressed longer stretches of time before it happens are exponentially less likely thanshorter ones The combination of these exponentials is pretty ZipfyFor example if all 26 letters and the spacebar are equally likely to be typedafter a letter is typed and a word has begun the probability that the nextinput will be a space thus creating a one letter word is just one in 27And sure enough if you randomly generate characters or hire a proverbial typingmonkey about one out of every 27 or 37 percent of the stuff between spaceswill be single letters Two letter words appear when after beginning a word anycharacter but the space bar is hit  a 26 in 27 chance and then the space bar A threeletter word is the probabilityof a letter another letter and then a space If we divide by the number ofunique words of each length there can be we get the frequency of occurrenceexpected for any particular word given its length For example the letter V willmake up about 0142 percent of random typing The word Vsauce00000000993 percent Longer words are less likely but watch this Lets spreadthese frequencies out according to the ranks theyd take up on a most oftenused list There are 26 possible one letter words so each of the top 26ranked words are expected to occur about this often The next 676 ranks will be taken up by two letter words that show up aboutthis often If we extend each frequency according to how many members it haswe get Zipf Subsequent researchers have detailed how changing up the initialconditions can smooth the steps out Our mysterious distribution has been createdout of nothing but the inevitabilities of math So maybe there is no mystery Maybe wordsare just the result of humans randomly segmenting the observable world and themental world into labels and Zipfs law describes what naturally happens whenyou do that Case closed and as always And as always thanks for wait a minute Actual language is very different fromrandom typing Communication is deterministic to a certain extentUtterances and topics arrive based on what was said before And the vocabularywe have to work with certainly isnt the result of purely random namingFor example the monkey typing model cant explain why even the names of theelements the planets and the days of the week are used in language according toZipfs law Sets like these are constrained by the natural world and theyre not theresult of us randomly segmenting the world into labels Furthermore when givena list of novel words words theyve never heard or used before like whenprompted to write a story about alien creatures with strange names people willnaturally tend to use the name of one alien twice as often as another threetimes as often as another Zipfs law appears to be built into our brains Perhaps thereis something about the way thoughts and topics of discussion ebb and flow thatcontributes to Zipfs law Another way Zipfian distributionsoccur is via processes that change according to how theyve previouslyoperated These are called preferential attachment processesThey occur when something  money views attention variation friends jobsanything really is given out according to how much is already possessedTo go back to the carpet example if most people walk from the living room to thekitchen across a certain path furniture will be placed elsewhere making thatpath even more popular The more views a video or image or post hasthe more likely it is to get recommended automatically or make the news forhaving so many views both of which give it more views Its like a snowball rolling down asnowy hill The more snow it accumulates the bigger its surface area becomes forcollecting more and the faster it grows There doesnt have to be a deliberatechoice driving a preferential attachment process It can happen naturally Try thisTake a bunch of paper clips and grab any two at random Link them together and then throw themback in the pile Now repeat over and over again If you grab paper clips thatare already part of a chain link em anyway More often than not after a whileyou will have a distribution that looks Zipfian A small number of chainscontain a disproportionate amount of the total paperclip count This is simplybecause the longer a chain gets the greater proportion of the whole itcontains which gives it a better chance of being picked up in the future andconsequently made even longer The rich get richer the big get biggerthe popular get popularer Its just math Perhaps languages Zipf mystery is if notcaused by it at least strengthened by preferential attachment Once a word isused its more likely to be used again soon Critical points may play a role as well Writing and conversation often stick to atopic until a critical point is reached and the subject is changed andthe vocabulary shifts Processes like these are known to result in power laws So inthe end it seems tenable that all these mechanisms might collude to make Zipfslaw the most natural way for language to be Perhaps some of our vocabulary andgrammar was developed randomly according to Mandelbrots theory And the naturalway conversation and discussion follow preferential attachment and criticalitycoupled with the principle of least effort when speaking and listening areall responsible for the relationship between word rank and frequency Its a shame that the answer isntsimpler but its fascinating because of the consequences it has on whatcommunication is made of Roughly speaking and this is mind blowing nearlyhalf of any book conversation or article will be nothing but the same 50 to 100words And nearly the other half will be words that appear in that selection onlyonce Thats not so surprising when you consider the fact that one word accountsfor 6 percent of what we say The top 25 most used words make up about a third ofeverything we say and the top 100 about half Seriously I mean whether its all thewords in Wet Hot American Summer or all the words in Platos Complete Works orin the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe or the Bible itself only about 100 wordsare used for nearly half of everything written or said In Alices Adventures inWonderland 44 and in Tom Sawyer 498 of the unique words used appear onlyonce in the book A word that is used only once in a given selection of wordsis called a hapax legomenon Hapax legomena are vitally important tounderstanding languages If a word has only been found once in the entire knowncollection of an ancient language it can be very difficult to figure out what itmeans Now there is no corpus of everything ever said or written inEnglish but there are very very large collections and its fun to find hapax legomena in themFor instance and this probably wont be the case after Imention it but the word quizzaciously is in the Oxford English Dictionary butappears nowhere on Wikipedia or in the Gutenberg corpus or in the BritishNational Corpus or the American National Corpus but it does appear when searched injust one result on Google Fittingly in a book titled ElderSpeak that lists itas a rare word Quizzaciously by the way means in a mocking manner as inThe paradist rattled off quizzaciously Hey Vsauce Michael here But who is Michaeland how much does here weigh Its a little sad that quizzaciouslyhas been used so infrequently Its a fun word but thats the way things go ina Zipfian system Some things get all the love some get little Most of what youexperience on a daytoday basis is forgotten forgettable The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows as it often does has a word for this  Olēka  the awareness of howfew days are memorable Ive been alive for almost 11000 daysbut I couldnt tell you something about each one of them I mean not even close Most of what we do and see and think andsay and hear and feel is forgotten at a rate quite similar to Zipfs lawwhich makes sense If a number of factors naturally selected for thinking andtalking about the world with tools in a Zipfian way it makes sense wedremember it that way too Some things really well most things hardly at allBut it bums me out sometimes because it means that so much is forgotteneven things that at the time you thought you could never forget My locker number  senior year  its combination the jokesI liked when I saw a comedian on stage the names of people I saw every day 10years ago So many memories are gone When I look at all the books Ive read andrealize that I cant remember every detail from them its a littledisappointing I mean why even bother if the Pareto Principle dictates that myZipfian mind will consciously remember pretty much only the titles and a fewbasic reactions years later Ralph Waldo Emerson makes me feel betterHe once said I cannot remember the books Ive read any more than the meals I haveeaten Even so they have made me And as always thanks for

The Banach–Tarski Paradox,2015-08-01T00:44:21Z,24.233333333333334,44540419,1040842,Hey Vsauce Michael hereTheres a famous way to seemingly create chocolate out ofnothing Maybe youve seen it beforeThis chocolate bar is 4 squares by 8 squares but if you cut it like this and then like this and finally like this you can rearrange the pieces like so and wind up with the same 4 by 8 bar but with a leftover piece apparentlycreated out of thin air Theres a popularanimation of this illusion as well I call it an illusion because its just that FakeIn reality the final bar is a bit smallerIt contains this much less chocolate Each squarealong the cut is shorter than it was in the original but the cut makes it difficult to noticeright away The animation is extra misleading because it tries tocover up its deception The lost height of each square issurreptitiously added in while the piece moves to makeit hard to notice I mean come on obviously you cannot cut upa chocolate bar and rearrange the pieces into more thanyou started with Or can youOne of the strangest theorems in modern mathematics is theBanachTarski paradox It proves that there is in fact a way totake an object and separate it into 5 different pieces And then with those five pieces simply rearrange themNo stretching required into two exact copies of the original item Same density same size same everything Seriously To dive into the mind blow that it is and the way it fundamentallyquestions math and ourselves we have to start by askinga few questions First what is infinity A numberI mean its nowhere on the number line but we often say things like theres an infinite number of blahblahblah And as far as we know infinity could be real The universe may be infinite in size and flat extending out for ever and ever without end beyond even the part we canobserve or ever hope to observe Thats exactly what infinity isNot a number per se but rather a sizeThe size of something that doesnt endInfinity is not the biggest number instead it is how many numbers there are But there are differentsizes of infinity The smallest type of infinity is countable infinityThe number of hours in forever Its also the number of wholenumbers that there are natural number  the numbers we use whencounting things like 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so on Sets like these are unending but they are countable Countablemeans that you can count them from one element to any other in a finite amount of time even if that finiteamount of time is longer than you will live or the universe will exist for its still finite Uncountable infinity on the other hand is literally biggerToo big to even count The number of real numbers that there are not just whole numbers but all numbers is uncountably infiniteYou literally cannot count even from 0 to 1 in a finite amount oftime by naming every real number in betweenI mean where do you even startZero okay But what comes next 0000000 Eventually we would imagine a 1 going somewhere at the end but there is no end We could always add another 0Uncountability makes this set so much larger than the setof all whole numbers that even between 0 and 1 there are more numbers than there are whole numbers on theentire endless number line Georg Cantors famous diagonal argument helps illustrate thisImagine listing every number between zero and one Since they areuncountable and cant be listed in order lets imagine randomly generating them forever with no repeats Each number regenerate can be paired with a whole number If theres a one toone correspondence between the two that is if we can match one whole numberto each real number on our list that would mean that countable and uncountable sets are the same sizeBut we cant do that even though this list goes on for ever Forever isnt enoughWatch this If we go diagonally down our endlesslist of real numbers and take the first decimalof the first number and the second of the second numberthe third of the third and so on and add one to each subtracting one if it happens to be a nine we cangenerate a new real number that is obviously between 0 and 1 but since weve defined it to bedifferent from every number on our endless listand at least one place its clearly not contained in the list In other words weve used up everysingle whole number the entire infinity of them and yet wecan still come up with more real numbersHeres something else that is true but counterintuitiveThere are the same number of even numbers as there are even and odd numbers At first that soundsridiculous Clearly there are only half as many even numbers as all whole numbersbut that intuition is wrong The set of all whole numbers is denser but every even number can be matched with awhole number You will never run out of members eitherset so this one to one correspondence shows that both sets are the same size In other words infinity divided by two is still infinity Infinity plus one is also infinity A good illustration of this is Hilbertsparadox up the Grand HotelImagine a hotel with a countably infinite number ofrooms But now imagine that there is a person bookedinto every single room Seemingly its fully booked rightNo Infinite sets go against common sense You see if a new guest shows up and wants a room all the hotel has to do is move theguest in room number 1 to room number 2 And a guest in room 2 toroom 3 and 3 to 4 and 4 to 5 and so on Because the number of rooms is never ending we cannot run out of roomsInfinity 1 is also infinity again If one guest leaves the hotel we can shift every guest the other wayGuest 2 goes to room 1 3 to 2 4 to 3 and so on because we have an infinite amount of guests That is anever ending supply of them No room will be left emptyAs it turns out you can subtract any finite number from infinity and still be left with infinityIt doesnt care Its unending BanachTarski hasnt leftour sights yet All of this is relatedWe are now ready to move on to shapesHilberts hotel can be applied to a circle Points around thecircumference can be thought of as guests If we remove one point from the circle that point is gone rightInfinity tells us it doesnt matterThe circumference of a circle is irrational Its the radius times 2Pi So if we mark off points beginning fromthe whole every radius length along thecircumference going clockwise we will never land on the same pointtwice everWe can count off each point we mark with a whole numberSo this set is neverending but countable just like guests androoms in Hilberts hotel And like those guestseven though one has checked out we can just shift the restMove them counterclockwise and every room will befilled Point 1 moves to fill in the hole point 2 fills in the place where point 1 used to be3 fills in 2 and so on Since we have a unendingsupply of numbered points no hole will be left unfilled The missing point is forgottenWe apparently never needed it to be complete Theres one last needoconsequence of infinity we should discuss before tackling BanachTarskiIan Stewart famously proposed a brilliant dictionary One that he called the HyperwebsterThe Hyperwebster lists every single possible word of any length formed from the 26 letters in theEnglish alphabet It begins with a followed by aa then aaa then aaaa And after an infinite number of those ab then aba then abaa abaaa and so on until z za zaa et cetera et ceterauntil the final entry in infinite sequence of zsSuch a dictionary would contain every single wordEvery single thought definition description truth lie name storyWhat happened to Amelia Earhart would be in that dictionaryas well as every single thing that didnt happened to Amelia Earhart Everything that could be said using our alphabetObviously it would be huge but the company publishing it mightrealize that they could take a shortcut If they put all the wordsthat begin with a in a volume titled A they wouldnt have to print the initial aReaders would know to just add the a because its the a volumeBy removing the initial a the publisher is left with every a word sans the first a which has surprisingly become every possible wordJust one of the 26 volumes has beendecomposed into the entire thing It is now that were ready toinvestigate this videos titular paradoxWhat if we turned an object a 3D thing into a Hyperwebster Could we decompose pieces of it into thewhole thing YesThe first thing we need to do is give every single point on thesurface of the sphere one name and one name only A good way todo this is to name them after how they can be reached by a given starting point If we move this starting point acrossthe surface of the sphere in steps that are just the right lengthno matter how many times or in what direction we rotate so longas we never backtrack it will never wind up in thesame place twice We only need to rotate in fourdirections to achieve this paradox Up down left and right around two perpendicular axesWe are going to need every single possible sequence that canbe made of any finite length out of just thesefour rotations That means we will need lef right up and down as well as left left left up left down but of course not left right because well thatsbacktracking Going left and then right means youre the same asyou were before you did anything so no left rights no right lefts and no updowns and no down ups Also notice that Im writingthe rotations in order right to left so the final rotation is the leftmost letterThat will be important later on Anyway A list of all possible sequencesof allowed rotations that are finite in lenght is well huge Countably infinite in fact But if we apply each one of them to astarting point in green here and then name the point weland on after the sequence that brought us therewe can name a countably infinite set of pointson the surface Lets look at how say these four stringson our list would work Right up left Okay rotating the startingpoint this way takes us here Lets colour code the pointbased on the final rotation in its string in this case its left and for that we will use purpleNext up down down That sequence takes us hereWe name the point DD and color it blue since we ended with a down rotationRDR that will be this points name takes us hereAnd for a final right rotation lets use redFinally for a sequence that end with up lets colour code the point orange Now if we imagine completing thisprocess for every single sequence we will have acountably infinite number of points named and colorcodedThats great but not enoughThere are an uncountably infinite number of points on a spheres surface But no worries we can just pick a pointwe missed Any point and color it green making it a new starting point and then run everysequence from hereAfter doing this to an uncountably infinite number ofstarting point we will have indeed named and colored every single point onthe surface just onceWith the exception of poles Every sequence has two poles ofrotation Locations on the sphere that come back toexactly where they started For any sequence of right or left rotations the polls are the north andsouth poles The problem with poles like these isthat more than one sequence can lead us to them They can be named more than once and be colored in more than one color For example ifyou follow some other sequence to the north or south pole any subsequent rights or lefts will be equally valid names In order to dealwith this were going to just count them out of the normal scheme and color them all yellowEvery sequence has two so there are a countably infinite amount of them Now with every point on thesphere given just one name and just one of six colorswe are ready to take the entire sphere apart Every point on the surfacecorresponds to a unique line of points below it all the way to the center pointAnd we will be dragging every points line along with itThe lone center point we will set aside Okay first we cut outand extract all the yellow poles the green starting points the orange up points the blue down points and the red and purple left and rightpoints Thats the entire sphereWith just these pieces you could build the wholething But take a look at the left piece It is defined by being a piece composed of every point accessed via a sequence ending with a left rotationIf we rotate this piece right thats the same as adding an R to every points nameBut left and then right is a backtrack they cancel each otherout And look what happens when you reduce them away The set becomes the same as a set of all points with namesthat end with L but also U D and every point reached with no rotationThats the full set of starting points We have turned less than a quarter ofthe sphere into nearly threequarters just by rotating it We added nothing Its likethe Hyperwebster If we had the right piece and the poles of rotation and the centerpoint well weve got the entire sphere again but with stuff left overTo make a second copy lets rotate the up piece downThe down ups cancel because wellits the same as going nowhere and were left with a set of allstarting points the entire up piece the right piece and the leftpiece but theres a problem here We dont need this extra set of startingpoints We still havent used the original ones No worries lets juststart over We can just move everything from the uppiece that turns into a starting point whenrotated down That means every point whose finalrotation is up Lets put them in the piece Of course after rotatingpoints named UU will just turn into points named Uand that would give us a copy here and hereSo as it turns out we need to move all points with any name that is just a string of Us We will put them in the down piece androtate the up piece down which makes it congruent tothe up right and left pieces add in the down piecealong with some up and the starting point piece and wellwere almost done The poles of rotation and center are missing from this copy but no worriesTheres a countably infinite number of holeswhere the poles of rotations used to be which means there is some pole aroundwhich we can rotate this sphere such that every pole hole orbits around withouthitting another Well this is just a bunch of circleswith one point missing We fill them each like we did earlierAnd we do the same for the centerpoint Imagine a circle that contains it insidethe sphere and just fill in from infinity and lookwhat weve done We have taken one sphere and turned itinto two identical spheres without adding anything One plus one equals 1That took a while to go throughbut the implications are huge And mathematicians scientists andphilosophers are still debating them Could such a process happen in the realworld I mean it can happen mathematically andmath allows us to abstractly predict and describe a lot of things in the realworld with amazing accuracy but does the BanachTarski paradox take it too farIs it a place where math and physics separateWe still dont know History is full of examples ofmathematical concepts developed in the abstract that we did not think would ever applyto the real world for years decades centuriesuntil eventually science caught up and realized they were totally applicable and useful The BanachTarski paradox couldactually happen in our realworld the only catch of course is that thefive pieces you cut your object into arent simple shapesThey must be infinitely complex and detailed Thats not possible to do inthe real world where measurements can only get so small and theres only a finite amount of timeto do anything but math says its theoretically valid and some scientists think it may be physically valid too There have been a number of paperspublished suggesting a link between by BanachTarski and the way tiny tiny subatomicparticles can collide at high energies and turninto more particles than we began with We are finite creatures Our lives are small and can only scientificallyconsider a small part of realityWhats common for us is just a sliver of whats available We canonly see so much of the electromagnetic spectrum We can only delve so deep intoextensions of space Common sense applies to that which wecan accessBut common sense is just that CommonIf total sense is what we want we should be prepared toaccept that we shouldnt call infinity weird or strange The results weve arrived at byaccepting it are valid true within the system we use tounderstand measure predict and order the universe Perhaps the system still needsperfecting but at the end of day history continues to show us that theuniverse isnt strange We are And as always thanks for watching Finally as always the description is fullof links to learn more There are also a number of books linkeddown there that really helped me wrap my mind kinda around BanachTarski First of all Leonard Wapners The Pea and the Sun This book is fantastic and its full of lot of the preliminaries needed to understand the proof that comes laterHe also talks a lot about the ramifications of what BanachTarski and theirtheorem might mean for mathematics Also if you wanna talk about math andwhether its discovered or invented whether it really truly will map onto the universeYanofskys The Outer Limits of Reason is great This is the favorite book of mine that Ive readthis entire year Another good one is E Brian Davies Why Beliefs Matter This is actuallyCorns favorite book as you might be able to see thereIts delicious and full of lots of great information about the limits of what wecan know and what science is and what mathematics is If you love infinity and math I cannotmore highly recommend Matt Parkers Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension Hes hilarious and this book is very very great at explaining some prettyawesome things So keep readingand if youre looking for something to watch I hope youve already watched KevinLiebers film on Field Day I already did a documentary about Whittier Alaska over there Kevins got a great short film aboutputting things out on the Internet and having people react to them Theresa rumor that Jake Roper might be doing something on Field Day soon So check out mine check out Kevins and subscribe to Field Day for upcoming JakeRoper action yeah Hes actually in this room right now sayhi Jake Jake Hi Thanks for filming this by the way Guys I really appreciate who you all are And as always thanks for

Who Owns The Moon?,2015-07-03T18:19:40Z,11.8,9982584,204265,Hey Vsauce Michael hereGregory W Nemitz registered some land containing 492 quintillion dollars worth of platinum The land was right here well over here  an asteroid named 433 ErosNot a single sovereign nation on earth recognizes human claims toextraterrestrial real estate but he did it anywayAnd then less than a year later NASA landed a probe on the asteroid They called it the first asteroidwe had ever landed a probe on Nemitz called it parking space number 29and promptly sent NASA a 20 dollar parking ticketBut so far NASA and the US Attorney General have dismissed the fine saying that his claim to own the asteroid is without legal merit But why Plenty of organizations exists that willgladly take your money in return for land on the Moon Venus MarsAnd if you had enough money to go to the Moon nothing is legally stopping you from moving there building a house with a significantother having some kids and turning your Moon house into a Moon homeIt wouldnt be trespassing or squatting or stealingThe 1979 Moon Treaty says that no one can own any part of outer space ever but only 11 states have signed itHowever 129 nations have signed andor ratified the 1967 Outer Space Treaty which says that outerspace is not subject to national appropriationIt says nothing about a private individual or a company owning part of outer space But without the recognition and supportof at least one sovereign nation what does ownership really mean I mean I can claim anything I wantI can claim to own Prospect Park in Brooklyn but just saying that I do oreven moving there and living in Prospect Park wouldntentitle me to the rights that usually go along with ownership unless someone with a bunch of power agreed that I owned it and could enforcethat ownership and keep others from claiming to also own itIn the past explorers had few qualms about claiming to own land even if other humans were already therebecause they had power on their side  mainly plenty of guns Germs and SteelTo paraphrase con artist Canada Bill Jones you know what beats four aces A gunOr as lawblob pointed out McDonalds actually does servebreakfast after 1030 if you have a gun If you claimed someland on the Moon as your own and moved in would you also have to hire your own lunar police and Cislunar military to defend it andto keep others from challenging your claimPretty much Thats kind of the problemCurrently it is risky for individuals or corporations to claim and use extraterrestrial territorybecause the Outer Space Treaty says that outer space is the common heritage of mankindIt belongs to all of us and only to all of us Many interpretations of the Outer SpaceTreaty predict that powerful things like nations would be reluctant to come to yourdefense should someone else want to move in or cause trouble or dispute your extraterrestrial claim Maybe you could get the sovereign nationto weigh in on your behalf by declaring universal jurisdiction but that would need to be for anincredibly terrible heinous crime a crime against all of humanity not just a dispute over a few space rocks Catherine Doldirina from theInstitute of Air  Space Law at McGill University suggests that considering outer space the common heritage of mankind has slowed space exploration You see the Outer Space Treaty was basedon the Antarctic Treaty which says that the entire continent shall never become the scene or objectof international discord Discord is not a good thing butwithout an incentive to profit from it not much has happened thereas opposed to the Arctic where a resource boom iscurrently underway If people felt safer appropriating andtaking advantage of space of celestial bodies if technological development was more incentivized would we already have orbiting tourist attractions and lunar hotelsMaybe But here is what you can currently own in outer space stuff you put there and to a certain extent orbits The Outer Space Treaty says that thestuff we left on the move anything put into space remains property of the original owner foreverOrbits around earth are temporarily granted by theInternational Telecommunication Union a UN agencybut they dont work like typical real estate on EarthWhen a group of Equatorial nations attempted to claim orbits above theirland boundaries without planning on putting satellites there their claim was largely ignored So you not only need to ask the UN for an orbit and get permissionyou also need to use it and fill it Its a little disappointing that wedont know how lunar real estate works or if it will but its exciting to know that wewithin our lifetimes might have a chance to be part of the solution A unique generation not visiting spacefor the first time but homesteading it for the first time Heres another unresolved space law quandary If an alien landed in your backyard intelligent life from beyond Earth and you shot it with a gun dressed it and then cooked upyou and your family some alien meat fajitas would that be hunting or murder We literally dont knowOn earth we have human rights but there are no alien rights Maybe it would fall under the category of cultural vandalism an act thats not necessarily a legal but is a giant bummer to the rest of humanityThis has happened before  not with aliens  but with paintings In 2003 the Chapman brothers purchasedone of the few remaining sets of Goyas Fantastic Disasters of War Instead of displaying the works for thepublic they defaced them by drawing clown and puppy heads on the people They called the work insult to injury In protest a man threw red paint onJake Chapman when he appeared at Modern Art Oxford but at the end of the daywhat the Chapman brothers did wasnt illegalThey owned the paintings Vandalizing the Moon or killing a peaceful alien arent illegal acts but just like defacing historicalpaintings they seem wrong on some deeper level especially since because inmost museums you usually cant even touch the paintings But who was the first person to touch the Moon with their bare hands I mean the guys who walked around on theMoon wore space suits they had material in between their skin and the MoonWell to be sure you already have the Moon in your hands Well little MoonsLunula The crescentshaped area at the base ofyour fingernail where tissue is thicker and the redvascular structures underneath are more hidden making it whiteAnd to be even more sure at the quantum level touch isproblematic As Ive covered before atomically speaking matter never really contacts other matter in the conventional senseYou cant truly touch anythingMinutePhysics called it interaction over a short distance With that in mind NASA says the Terry Slezak was the first person totouch the Moon with his bare hands He was a technicianin quarantine who accidentally got lunar soil smeared all over his hand while removing film magazines from the astronauts camerasBut when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the lunar module after their moonwalk and removed theirhelmets they came into contact with lunar dust they tracked in on their suitsThey even reported its odor saying it smelled of spent gunpowder or ashes possibly because it oxidized on contact with the air in the cabinPoint is the first few breaths of Moon dusty air that Armstrong and Aldrin took in were our first fleshly contact with the Moon Or were theyWalking around on earth every day I am surrounded by material that recently was in outer space Hundreds of metrictons of extraterrestrial rock falls to Earth every yearSome from the Moon but most from asteroids ejected by a highspeed impact andeventually caught by Earths gravitySome pieces are big enough to see but most are pulverized by our atmosphereduring entry into tiny particles that disperse in the air becoming a tiny fraction of the very dust and dirt we clean up and breathe in every day Theres microscopic space dust pieces of asteroids and even the Moon all around us In fact there might be microscopicpieces of the Moon under your bed right now or even under your fingernails Which means thefirst human to have fleshly contact with lunar material was the first Homo Sapien hundreds ofthousands of years ago to walk on dirt We are still studyingexactly how much cosmic dust is in the air that we breathe every day but its safe to say that every once ina while you inhale some material that was recently in outer space some of which thousands ofyears ago was on the Moon Was the Moon And just like otherparticulates in our atmosphere large enough pieces get trapped in themucus that protects our lungs meaning that picking your nose is gross but every once in a whilea booger could literally be out of this world And as always thanks for

DINOSAUR SCIENCE! feat. Chris Pratt and Jack Horner,2015-06-17T21:42:30Z,9.6,3977866,110254,Hey Vsauce Michael hereWhat are monstersScary unnatural thingsYes but theyre more than that and we knewthat back when we named them The word monster comes from the same root word as demonstrate and demonstrative monere meaning to teach to instruct to warn Monsters like dinosaurs and the stories we tell about them have a lot to tell us about ourselves about the past and about the future This Vsauce1 video is not an ordinary video it is a dinosaurdnary video built not just out of me talking but also worldfamous palaeontologist and technical adviser to every Jurassic Park film Jack Horner and the hilarious Chris PrattFirst things first scientists have so far broken Earthshistory down into 22 periodsThe Jurassic period has come and gone but the one we live in today is calledthe Quaternary Jurassic World is the movie that youre inYesThe thing that were filming right now Quaternary WorldQuaternary WorldWe are organisms from the Quaternary Quaternary Park would be wellbasically like Universal Studios or something Exactly Actually literally any place on Earth right now Dinosaurs fossilsYeahDinosaur fossil Fossil fossil fuelWowIs it safe to say that our cars run on the ghosts of dinosaurs That question sounds mindblowing but is it trueAre we really fuelling our cars with dinosaur remainsWell I asked paleontologist Jack Horner and his answer is worth beginning fromthe bottom or rather from things that come out of bottoms Youll see what I meanOkay so this Let me guess what this OkayYeah it looks like coal almost Well they are its actually a coproliteWhats a coprolite Fossilised dungDung Oh so this is plant material that was eaten Eaten Turned into poop YesAnd then preserved so that I could hold it todayYes exactly Thats a dinosaur poopThis is dinosaur poop Yes It smells like a rockSometimes when we break open somebodys things that are that have a have a very high concentration plantmaterial you actually can smell it Really UhmWhat does it smell like Mmmh rotting woodAfter this long it still has an odour of rottingIt can yes So we can probably learn a lotWe can learn more about the dinosaur from that right therethan we can from the bone from its body That is amazingBecause we can determine we can determine exactly what it was eating and and and we can look at how its chopped up so you can tell a lot about exactly how they process the foodSo from the scientific perspective of learningabout dinosaurs poop is not crappy at all Yes Thanks for laughing at that Now at any point would that turn into oilNo oil does not come from dinosaur poopDoes it come from dinosaurs at all It doesnt come from dinosaurs at allThey come from microorganisms and oceansIf you took all of the dinosaurs that ever lived and and you know squished them up in order to get the oil out of them wed probably go through that oil inyou know couple of days No kiddingI mean the microorganisms from the ocean from the oceans over these millions of years produced I mean the biomass is just incredible Compared to the dinosaursSo there could be a tiny molecule of oil in every thousand gallons or more thats from a dinosaurNo  you really not even gonna Thats not even going to happen as wellBasically all of the oil reserves we have are in in sedimentary rocks produced in oceans So we dont put dinosaur ghosts into our cars but dont feel lonelyThere are actual living dinosaurs with us today There are dinosaurs still around todayDinosaurs never went extinct What Elaborate alright fine I willSo dinosaurs Yeah thats what I meantDinosaurs are not a species that was called a clade Theyre from the clade dinosauriaAnd the clade is just some organism and all of its descendantsOkay Okay Dinosaurs came in all different types right All of these things were called dinosauria and then a huge extinction eventhappened 65 million years ago YupGiant rock hit Earth and like almost all of them all the ones died except for a few And you know what this one was this little branch Thats what clade means by the way  branch Aardvark Aardvark NoUhh I do I know what it wasWhat Halibut Just for the halibut I will say correct Thats a dumb jokethats a joke thats been made a bunch Ive never heard it before ReallyYou just said halibut like hell of it Yeah Yeah ClassicNow figure this trout Wow Dude The answer is birds Technically birds arent just descendedfrom dinosaurs they literally are dinosaur Exactly You know to determine how things are related to one another we look at the characteristicsthat they share and when you think about birds and thecharacteristics that we think of as being bird characteristicsthey are feathers hollow bones the wishbone you know you can go on and onbut those are just a few of them and it turns out dinosaurs havethem as well so dinosaurs had these characteristics before birds The hypothesis is that birds are the dinosaursThe meteor impact that killed off the dinosaurs didnt kill off all of themIt killed off then what we call the nonavian dinosaurs and the avian dinosaurs we still have with usIn Jurassic World the parks decisionmakers create dinosaurs that have appearances that bring in tourists not appearances that arehistorically accurate For example they didnt put feathers onany of their dinosaurs although it is believed that many dinosaurs had feathers Its believed that thevelociraptor probably actually looked more like this And as far as the reality of creating apark like Jurassic World Horner had this to say Everything about it is fictional we cant bring dinosaurs back by cloning them If we make dinosaurs which I hope we are able to do one of thesedays it will be retro engineering from a bird in other words going backwards from a birdTheyre still going to be fictional creatures because theyre not going to be historical dinosaursTheyll be things we madeTheyll be things we make yeah thats right Why are we so thrilled by the idea of bringing back unextincting nonavian dinosaurs You know whatThat actually brings up an even bigger question Why are dinosaurs so fascinating to kidsDinosaurs are terrifying and we love to be scared but Dracula and ghosts and all this stuff its a little its a little not real But dinosaurs Weve got their fossilsRight You know Weve got the fact that no these reallywere on Earth they really were walking around right here Why is it so awesome when they flip outand start killing people Watching something flip out and killpeople is thrilling Its morbid curiosity but the more intense the flip out the more exciting it is to see the flip undone to see humans prevail in the endNo matter how beastly and huge dinosaurs werethe fact remains that they went extinctThey are a reminder that sooner or later the universe will beat everythingA meteor impact like the one that killed off all the nonavian dinosaurswill happen again in about the next 100 million years orso but we might stand a fighting chance We have technology and we have the ability to predict and possibly even avoida similar fate involing us Outer space may seem distant and sometimes irrelevant to pressing earthly concerns but lets not forget what Larry Niven saidThe dinosaurs went extinct because they didnt havea space program And as always thanks for

The Moon Terminator Illusion,2015-06-07T16:47:21Z,11.75,6862822,177696,Hey Vsauce Michael hereThis is called the dolly zoom effectand the optics that make it possible are also responsible for whats called the moon terminator illusion A terminator is the line between an illuminated and dark sideLight arrives perpendicular to the terminator but itdoesnt always appear toMaybe youve noticed this before When the Moon and the Sun are up at the same timeand a good distance apart in the sky the direction the Moon is being lit from wont always appear to line up with the position of the SunWhats going on here The answer lies in visual anglesThe further away from you something is the smaller it will appear to beIn psychophysical terms its visual angle shrinks  the angle within your field ofview that it stretches across Now this means that everythingwe look at is foreshortened that is it diminishes incise towards the horizon line A line infinitely far awayThings that far away are foreshortened to the point at whichthey have no height whatsoeverThis distortion affects everything that we look atBut it doesnt confuse us because our brains know about itWe can look at an object that is foreshortened and figure out what it probably actually looks like For example a door is a rectangle but its wrecked by foreshortening when openedCloser distances appear larger The whole shape is different but your brain isntfreaked out every time a door opens because it understands that different sensations dont necessarily mean different actual thingsIts called subjective constancyOur brains cleverly factor in previous experience and perspective clues fromthe surrounding world to calculate in real time whether changes in what we sense are because of actual changes in the things were looking at or arejust merely products of their positions or the surroundings For example I right now on this video screen am vulnerable to foreshorteningBut I probably look okay to youHowever if we frame in really closely and remove surrounding perspective cluesI can be made to look weird strange a little scary distendedIm foreshortened without the necessary tools around me for you to mentally adjustThis is probably the crux of the Moon terminator illusionTake a look at this The line where that wall meets the ceiling is a straight lineSeriously take a look If you look to the left and rightit continues to look straight and trust me this building was built with level straight ceilingsBut thats not what your eye sensesA camera will help demonstrate this It doesnt add in thepost sensation processing that our brains do and we can also frame in to remove otherclues telling us what to think Now sure enough right in front of us the line is level with the screen of the camera its a straight line  but if we move our eyes across the linelook what happens If I pan this way the slope changes and now the lineappears to be going up and to the leftAnd if I panned this way the line appears to be movingup and to the right Whats going on hereA straight line cant have changing slope thats what a curved line does Just like the curve we think we seebetween the Sun and the MoonBut wait If the line between the Sun and the Moon iscurved because of foreshortening why dont we see lines like this one as curvesWell heres a clueClues We know what rooms are supposed to look likeWe know how theyre built We have experience with them and there are otherthings in the environment helping us But when you look at the skytheres not much to help you In the absence of clues about distanceand perspective our brains assume that whatever were looking at is equidistant from us making the sky a sort of dome surface like a planetarium screen The only clue we have then is the horizonbut its a red herring because the horizon doesnt foreshortenIts just a place where due to foreshortening everything becomes infinitely flat Brian Rogers and Olga Naumenko demonstrated that these things result in the terminator illusion by using a planetarium They projected two dots onto its domemimicking our perception of the Sun and the Moon Theyve then askedparticipants to place a third dot on the straight line connecting them But just as in the Moon terminator illusion people incorrectly placed the third dotThey were influenced by a desire to stay parallel to the horizon as if it was subject to the same foreshortening rulesOur brains also often fail to factor in foreshorteningwhen it comes to crepuscular rays light beams streaming through gaps in clouds They appear to converge from a common pointas if the Sun is only a few thousand meters above Earth but ofcourse in fact the Sun is extremely far away and these lines are actually pretty much exactly parallel Its true They look like they convergefor the same reason railroad tracks appear to converge The visual angle of the distance separating them shrinks the further down you lookSometimes our brains do the oppositeThey assume and consider foreshortening even when it isnt really there like in this illusion where the cars seem to be different sizes butin actuality on the page are all the same size Everything else inthe image is affected by foreshortening so our brains assume that the carsare too and decide that in order for them all to have the same visual angle which they do the more distant ones must be literally larger in real lifeThe rate at which the visual angle of something you are looking at changes asyou move toward it or away from it is not constantIn order to cut the visual angle of an object in half its distance from you must doubleThat means objects really really far away require a lotmore movement to have their visual angle changed compared to nearer objects This is called parallax and its a major reason moving allows us to learn so much about depthIts why stuff on the side of the road whizzes is by you as you drive pastwhile distant features of the landscape appear to only crawl pastA really distant thing like say the Moon 384000 kilometers away appears to move so little as you do it can seem to be following you Its not of course Its just geometryFor the same reasons moving a camera through space willaffect the visual angle of nearer things like the Vsauce mug here much more dramatically than distant thingslike Jake Chudnows album against the wall It is barely changing size as we move back and forthBut unlike moving zooming increases the visual angle ofeverything equally regardless of depthNotice that when zooming the distant album grows and shrinksright along with the mug Now if you move IN while zooming OUT or vice versa the zoom will be most apparent when looking at distant things while the move more apparent on near things The result can be trippyHere Ive been placed where both effects cancel each other outso everything around me changes instead Another great illusion thattakes advantage of parallax is the popular star field or hallway illusion Cover the middle of the videoand youll appear to be moving much fasterBut you if cover the edges youll appear to be moving much slower All youre doing is alteringthe perspective clues your brain receives about movementThe nearer stuff at the edge changes position fasterthan the distance stuff way ahead So if you cover the slow distance stuff your brain only has the faster moving stuff tojudge speed from But cover the faster near stuff and the slower stuff becomes the new nearYour brain assumes that youve slowed down The optics and mathematics behind all of these effects were understood at least thousands of years ago During the Renaissance artists used thatknowledge to produce paintings that imitated reality really wellI mean the perspective is quite realistic But the renaissance Why did it take so long for us get there I mean look at this preRenaissance painting What the heck is going on hereThe perspective is all wrong Thats not at all what such a scene would actually look likeArtists and viewers contemporary to works like that saw the world just like we do they saw foreshortening  they couldnt help butsee it Foreshortening is right there in plain sight No foreshortening is plain sightSo what gives Were medieval artists all just a bunch of five year olds No No in the sense that the question is wrong Realisticlooking perspective was usedway before the Renaissance Now it might not have always beenmathematically formal perspective but foreshortening was understoodWestern art went from this to this not because humans all of asudden became smarter but because of a difference in desire What to us today might look unrealistic and thus bad was in its time deliberate and popularThe shift to imitating the world mathematicallyas if seen through a window was more about cultural interests and objectivity and the individual than it was about artistsall of a sudden becoming smarterFurthermore perspective illusions shows that what we think we see isnt always what were seeing A childs drawing may seem crude in terms of objective mathematical imitation but there are other things about the world and our experience of it worth imitatingTeasing out the less plainly obvious to showsomething personal is sometimes even harder than followingperspective grids Picasso put it this way it It took me four years to learn to paint like Rafaelbut a lifetime to learn to paint like a child And as always thanks for watching,134.46808510638297,followingperspective,0.0,1.0,Y2gTSjoEExc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2gTSjoEExc

heroes who countCanadian Mike Smith holds the world record forthe largest number counted to in one breath  125 But the world record for the largest number ever counted to belongs to Jeremy Harper from Birmingham AlabamaIn order to set the record Harper never left his apartmentHe got regular sleep but from the moment he woke up in themorning until the moment he went to bed at night Harper did nothing but countHe streamed the entire process over the Internet and raised money forcharity while doing it but after three months of counting all day every day he finally reached the world record  1 millionNow a million might not sound like a lot but think of this wayOne thousand seconds is about 17 minutes but a million seconds is more than 11 daysAnd a billion seconds well thats more than 31 yearsTheres no full video online of Harper counting all the way to a million but you can watch John Harchick countall the way to 100000 if you have 74 hours to spare John also has some other channelsOne involves more than 300 videos of himself eating carrotsAnother more than 3000 videos of himself drinking waterMany of Johns videos literally have no viewsThey are as lonely as a video on YouTube can get A great way to find such videos is a website made by Jon van der KruisenThis website auto plays videos on YouTube that no one has yet watchedJohn and Jeremy as well as Mike the one breath countercounted like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and so onBut thats not the only way to count And it doesnt seem to be the one wereborn with Additive counting is the one were all familiar with where each next step is just one added to the lastBut what if we multiply it by a number instead Well that kind of counting is logarithmic from arithmos meaning number and logos meaning ratio proportionOn this scale similar distances are similar proportionsOne is a third of three and three is a third of nineFour is a third of 12 and so on Our brains perceive the world around uson a logarithmic scale Its believed that almost all of oursenses are multiplicative not additiveFor example how loud we perceive a sound to be Two boomboxes playing at the same volumedont sound twice as loud as oneIn order to make a sound that is perceived as being about twice as loud as one boomboxyou actually need ten times as many so 10And to double that loudness you would need a hundredAnd to double that loudness you would need a thousandHaving an intuitive sense of logarithmic scales built into your brainis probably an advantage when it comes to natural selection and survival because often proportion matters more than absolute valueFor example is there one lion hiding over there in the shadows or two is a very different question than are there ninety six lions about to attack us or ninety sevenSure in both cases Im just talking about one extra lion but adding one lion to one lion doubles the threat Adding one lion to 96 well thats basically nothing Logarithmic thinking and feeling mayexplain why life seems to speedup as we get olderIt seems like I was a child for everAnd in college in my early 20s just whizzed by And logarithmically that makes sensebecause each new year that I live is the smaller fraction of all the otheryears Ive already lived When you turn 2 years old the last year of your life is half your lifeBut when you turn 81 that last year that youve lived well thats just a tiny part of theother 80 that you know Logarithmic thinking isnt always helpful especially in scenarios where proportiondoesnt logically matter but we nonetheless act like it does One of my favorite examples isthe psychophysics of price paradoxThis is something almost all of us do Researchers found consistently thatpeople are willing to put a lot of effort into saving 5 dollars of a 10 dollar purchasebut they wont put much effort into saving 5 five dollars of a 2000 dollar purchase Its 5 dollars saved either waybut our natural obsession with proportion leads us astrayTake a look at these pictures Can you tell how many objects are in each of themYou probably can Its like really easyYou can tell if there are zero one two three or four objects in a photo without even needing to countHow are you doing that Is it some sort of sixth senseNo Psychologists call it subitizingWe can intuitively at a glance determine whether there areabout four or fewer objects in a photo This has been part of human culturefor a very long time and it may be the reason so many tallysystems from all over the world all through history wind up having to do something differentwhen counting the number five When estimating or comparing amounts above 4 the brain uses whats known as anapproximate number system Its a psychological ability we haveIts about 15 percent accurate It two amounts are at least 15percent different we can tell So for example 100 objects and 115 or a thousand and 1150 or 1200 If you wanna test the accuracy of yourapproximate number system Panamath has a pretty good testWe often take linear additive counting for grantedbut its not granted to us We arent born with itWe are however born with the ability to subitize and use an approximate number systemChildren younger than the age of three can tell without counting that this line of 4 coins contains fewer coins than this line of 6 even if you spread the 4 coins out into aline that is physically bigger longer than this line of 6However mysteriously around the age of 35 children lose this ability and begin saying that this line of 6 coins contains fewer coins than this long line of just 4 coins possibly because around this age the physical world of objectsphysical sizes is more salient in their minds But then when they begin to learn linear counting they reverse back and begin againcorrectly saying that this line of 6 contains more coins than this line of 4 around the age of 4The smallest physical thing science could ever hopeto observe is the Planck length In order to look at anything smalleryoud need to have so much energy concentrated in such a small areaa black hole would form and you would lose whatever you were looking at Okay with that in mind heres a questionWhat number is halfway inbetween 1 and 9 5 seems like the obvious answer There are four numbers on either side of 5its halfway between rightWell if you ask this question of a young child or a member of a culture that doesntteach a linear additive number line their answer will be 3You see they are exhibiting the human mindsnatural logarithmic tendency because 3 in that sense makes senseThree is three times larger than 1and 9 is three times larger than 3 Three is in the middle proportionatelyBut what if we took that logarithmic number line and change the one to bethe smallest thing we can observe the Planck length and the nine to be thelargest thing we can observe the observable universeWhat would go in the middleWell as it turns out we would The number of Planck lengths you couldstretch across a brain cell is equal to the number of your braincells it would take to stretch all the way across the observable universe sold So welcome to the middle And as always thanks for watching Hello again The YouTube channel Field Day

When Will We Run Out Of Names?,2015-04-13T21:20:53Z,10.883333333333333,15865443,435284,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAccording to the US Census Bureau right now in America there are 106 people named Harry Potter1 007 named James Bond and eight people named Justin BieberTheyre just arent enough names to go around There are more than 300 million people in America but a hundred and fiftythousand last names and five thousand first names is all you need to name 9 out of every 10 of themWhen are we gonna run out of names Perhaps its already happened to you If it hasnt whenTen years twenty years a hundred a thousand When will someone with your exact name become famousSo famous in fact that your legacy changes forever to just being not the person people think of whenthey hear your name And for that matter when will every reasonablymemorable pronounceable band name or brand name be taken When will authors have no choice but tojust start reusing book titles According to Rovi Corp owner of AllMusiccom the most used band name is Bliss followed in order by Mirage One Gemini Legacy Paradox and RainIn the past when fewer bands had already been created andyou couldnt just Google up every single band overlap was easier toget away with and one word band names were plentifulBut now after years and years and years of band formation well we have The Who but we also have The What The Where The When The Why The How and even The The In order to stand out nowand have your own unique name you have to be a bit more creative O Diarrhea Planet or Bettys Not a Vitamin which by the way is no longer trueBetty became a vitamin in 1994 What about Twitter handles or email addresses Have we already reached peak usernameWe already find ourselves often having to use abbreviations initials numbers or just choosing something completely different Will our children or our childrens children live in a world where the only remainingGmail addresses is are just random strings of alphanumeric characters Are we approaching a name crisis And if so should we even call it a name crisis lest we use up yet another precious name Maybe you already share your name withsomeone famous But if you dont how long will it be until you probably willI mean new famous people are popping up all the time faster now than ever before because of theInternet and they are gobbling up top Google search billingMaybe it wont happen until long after youve been dead butshouldnt the reservoir names not taken by notable people eventually  run outComputer scientist Samuel Arbesman approximated how many famous people there are alive today and I think his calculation will behelpful You see he points out that if we allow famous to simply mean being notable enoughto have your own Wikipedia page well because there are 700000 living people with Wikipedia pages right nowthat means one out of every 10000 people on earth today are famous Assuming at the leastthat that proportion remains constant since 255 people are born every minute that means every hour a future famous person is bornTheir name destined to become primarily associated with them not everyone else who shares their nameAll of those people will be relegated to disambiguation or the postnominal  not the famous oneLuckily if you do the math youll find that even at a rate of one future famous person born every hour it would still take dozens of millennia for most of us to expect a future famous person with our exact name to emerge Plus names changeNew ones become popular others obsolesce but for fun letsnot focus on names we popularly use and instead look at how many possible names there can beThe Social Security Administration allows up to 36 letters for a complete nameNow including spaces 27 letters filling 36 spots with repetition allowed means 3  sextillion possible combinations Thats more than Earth has atomsSo lets refine our limitsHow many pronounceable names are possibleFor that I say we look at what Randall Munroe the author of the fantastic What If didwhen asked about naming starsIf you want to give every single star in the observable universe a unique butpronounceable English name how long would the names have to be His approximation is reallyfascinating If we define unpronounceable word as a word thatcontains consonantvowel pairs we can roughly figure that thereare about 105 different such pair possibilities 105 Thats not too much different from 99 So funny enoughthere are about the same number of consonantvowel pairs possible as there are twodigit numbers which means we could give every star inthe observable universe a sayable unique name with just 24 letters the same number ofdigits it would take to just number all of themSo the bottom line is we may each have to give up uniquely owning a word or name thats common today but the potential number of namesthat can be made is really hardyIn fact before we run out of those our species will likely evolve tocommunicate in a completely different way Also names arent just labels A name on a screen a usernamea handle a screen name doesnt always act exactly like its ownerUser names can travel more quickly and more widely thanfleshandblood people and do things that their puppeteerswouldnt normally do away from the keyboardIts called the online disinhibition effectIf you cant see the people youre interacting withand they cant see you youre all just online hiding behinddifferent names than usual why hold backI mean clearly such a system cant be serious businessOn the Internet no one knows youre a dogWhy be nice or tell the truthThe subreddit KarmaCourt investigates and uncovers people who maythink that the less facetoface nature of the Internet makes lies easier to get away with Like this person who posted an imagesuggesting that theyve been single for a year but had users found out posted three months earlier a picture of my girlfriends catThese behaviors arent just what humans do when they can be anonymous or can hide behind different namesthese behaviors can also be caused by the names themselvesStudies have found that the username you use can impact how you behave Your own preexisting stereotypes andexpectations of certain words shapes colors can be confirmed by your behavior in the same way that studies have foundNFL and NHL players play more aggressively when wearing black uniforms Studies have also found that the more sexualized an avatar is you make someone usethe more conscious they will be of their own body imageAnd the more an avatar resembles you the more correlated you watching it exercise is with you being more likely to exercise moreIts called the Proteus effectThe features of a cyberspace version of yourselfa username and avatar can actually change you the meat space IRL youUsernames and avatars then arent just handles attached to us Psychologically we often interact with them as if theyre friends distinct beings we created They help us out but they also can influence us egg us on dare us to do things wewouldnt normally do because they offer us protection entertainmentSome make us feel safe professional funny dangerous attractiveWe want cool ones The cool ones make us look cool As we go about our daily lives and vie for attention we are more and morefrequently doing so with another name and exclusivelythrough that name onlySo it becomes quite interesting that were not going to run out of themanytime soon In fact they might run out of us first and may in many ways run us And as always thanks for

The Science of Awkwardness,2015-03-20T19:26:27Z,13.933333333333334,14129350,488064,Hey Vsauce Michael here Not knowing what to do with your hands or offering a handshake when the other person offers a fist bump Forgetting someones name Not having anything to say andforgetting your phone at home so you cant be distracted by itGetting caught staring at a stranger Striking up a conversation with someoneyou dont know in a bathroom Someone oversharing telling a group too much informationOverhearing a couple breaking up Noticing food in someones teeth but nottelling them and well now its been too long and bringing up would be weird Smelling a fart in an elevator that wasnt yours but well now you cant even react to itor mention that youve noticed it or pretend to even know what a fart isAll of those things are awkward We dont like awkwardness It makes us uncomfortable cringe But what is awkwardness Why is it good and who is the main character of the universe To really understand awkwardness we needto put it in context with the entire family of forces that guide social behaviour Think of this sheet of cardboard as alist all possible behaviours Its not infinite because ofthe limits of science and biology You cant move faster than lightor be in two places at once You cant wear pants made out of molten lead Next there are legal limits  the laws of the state They delineate what you agreenot to do lest the authorities punish you  murder stealing speeding Whats left is molded by the finder tool of social expectations Its not illegal to chew with your mouth open or not cover a sneeze on a crowded bus or act disrespectfully but it is frowned upon Punished not by the police but by social ostracism public opprobrium Being called rude gross mean annoying Awkwardness is the finest tool It sands social dynamics by smoothing out whateven etiquette doesnt rule on Its not a violation of the laws of physicsto accidentally hug someone for longer than they expectedIts not against the law either And the etiquettefor how long a hug should last isnt blackandwhite But it is awkward Like touching a hot stove orgetting a parking fine or losing friends awkwardness nudges us toavoid certain actions in the future and smooth things out when they happenPeople who demonstrate selfconsciousness when needed are communicating cooperative intentions which helps them get along well withothers Its no coincidence that brains susceptible to feeling occasionalawkwardness would become so common Theyre successful at cooperating at social life Feeling awkward showsthat you understand and are keen on smooth social exchanges Now too much or too little concern for social rules isnt healthy but researchers found that just the right amount is great When a person shows remorse or embarrassment or awkward discomfort when appropriate others perceive them as being moretrustworthy and their actions as more forgivable And its not just perception Such individuals also tend to be moreobjectively prosocial when tested Kinder more generous Even when a personis completely oblivious to a faux pas theyve committed awkwardness still arises People around them can feel uncomfortable Its called vicarious embarrassment and its a function of empathy  the ability to feel what others feel or will feel when or if they realize what theyve just done The more EEE someone is that is easily sympathetically embarrassedthe harder it is for them to sit through other peoples cringeinducing moments even fictional once like in cringe comedy Researchers found that being more easilyand pathetically embarrassed does not correlate to be more easilyembarrassed yourself Instead its linked to being more empathetic an important capacity for social creatures to haveOur seemingly counterintuitive attraction to viewing cringing moments like say bad American Idol auditionsis perhaps then just a light form of morbid curiosity You may think that awkwardness is totally different from physical pain or outright namecalling But your brain would disagree You see researchers found that social misstepsactivate among other regions the secondary somatosensory cortex and dorsal posterior insula  areas of thebrain that are also connected to the sensation of physical pain Our brains process the breaking of social standardsand the breaking of bones through similar neural pathways Likewise the same sympathetic nervous system thatmobilizes you to deal with physical threats fight or flight is activated by social challenges where awkwardness or embarrassment might be at stakeLike events where you are very aware of being watched Speaking in front of a group or embarrassing yourself in front ofonlookers or having nothing to say on a first date Awkward silence Your blood pressure increases causing you to overheat and sweat Oxygen is needed for fighting and running so breathingincreases and digestion shuts down causing nausea and butterflies in your stomach Your body instinctively contracts into aprotective fetal position and fighting that reaction to act natural makes you shake Blood vessels in your extremitiescontract to prioritize major organs leaving you with cold fingers and toes and nose These symptoms dont alleviate awkwardness they compound it But thats historys fault Long before human social dynamicswere complicated enough to involve is it one kiss or two or politics at Thanksgiving dinnerwe developed primitive reactions to physical threats and havent hadenough time yet to evolve newer ones Selfconscious anxiety can be tough to get out of ourminds after weve done something awkward Fixating on social blunders is easy and hard to overcome Why was I so unsure so unconfident so awkward Well some of the blame may lie with the neurotransmitter oxytocin Oxytocin is sometimes called the love hormone because it modulates prosocial feelings like trust and attachment which it does In fact nasal sprays of oxytocin are being used to increase trust during couples therapyand in the reduction of anxiety and depression Though there are fearsthat it could also be used to deviously increase trust and make aperson more susceptible to con artist schemes But oxytocin also modulates negative social feelings like fear and anxiety A dose of it makes people better at recognizing thefacial expressions for disgust and fright Its also involved in thefeelings that make us approach or avoid certain social stimuli And it may play a role in making positive and negative social interactions more salient in our memories that is stand out more command more of our attention after the fact make us think about them more Negative ones especially because of what psychologists call negativity bias All things being equal negative social interactions and negative emotions have a greater impact on our mentalstates than positive ones In fact we have more words for negative emotions than positive ones and a richer vocabulary to describe them Thus such memories andthoughts can be tough to just get over What does the other person think of me I was so awkward Are they telling other peopleWe replace social encounters in our heads over and over again Surely the person we were awkward withremembers us the same way were remembering ourselvesand is equally fixated on that awkward thing we did Or are they A great wet blanket for smothering thefire of selfconscious anxieties is perspectiveConsider the famous advice of Eleanor Roosevelt You wouldnt worry so muchabout what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do As much as you obsess over yourself youre not thefirst thing on everyone elses minds Theyre worried about themselves what you think about themAnd more importantly what they think about themselves Youre not the centre of their world Another famous old piece of advice tellsus that in your twenties and thirties you worry about what other people thinkabout you In your forties and fifties you stop worrying what other peoplethink about you And then finally in your sixties and seventiesyou realize that they were never thinking about you in the first place  The tendency to act and think as though you are thetrue main character of the universe has been called protagonist disease It seeps into our behavior all the time For instance the fundamental attribution error When evaluating actions you often view yourself as a complexcharacter acted upon by various challenges and antagonist whereas other people are seen as justonedimensional background characters with simple unchanging roles The guy who took way too longordering in front of you this morning well hes obviously just innately annoying person Thats his entire purposeBut when you take too long ordering its because the staff was unhelpfulor you were flustered preoccupied by an earlier conversation You are the main character after allYou know a lot more about whats going on in your life Its easy to live like that There isnt time or mental space toconsider every other person as complicated and fully flushed outBut they are The realization of this has a nameA name given to it by The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows one of my favorite resources and now YouTube channels They wrapprofound concepts up in tiny little word packages To be sure giving something a namedoesnt show that you know it or how to feel about it but nonethelesswords put handles on things so we can manipulate themhold them down offer them to others feel bigger than the concepts they label Now their word for acknowledging that you are just an extra in other peoples storiesnot even cast in most of them is sonder This is their definition of it Sonder  the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populatedwith their own ambitions friends routines worries and inherited craziness— an epic story that continuesinvisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground with  elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed in which you might only appear onceas an extra sipping coffee in the background as a blur of traffic passing on the highway as a  lighted window at dusk Acknowledging this makes your awkwardness looks small But it also makes all of you look small Tiny A needle in a giant haystack but nonetheless in possession of a big idea Your blemishes are lost from far away and so is your uniqueness but the view from way up here Well its unbeatable And as always thanks for

Human Extinction,2015-03-07T22:18:48Z,8.183333333333334,13334156,293012,Hey Vsauce Michael hereDo you want to be infected with Ebola without having to leave your own home ordeal with other people Well you might be in luck You canalready download an Ebola virus genome Right here on the Internet right nowAnd if youre willing to wait a few years for 3D bioprintingtechnology to progress a little bit you can just acquire onethen submit the genome to it and ta da All you can print Ebola Or anthrax or whatever it is you wish tomassproduce at home to wipe out humanity Are humans going to go extinct soon Will human extinction be anthropogenic That is the result of human action Or will it be one of the good oldfashioned kinds of extinction Earths history knows pretty well The Global Catastrophic Risks Surveyissued by Oxford Universitys Future of Humanity Institute placed our risk of extinction before the year 2100 at 19 Now you might be thinking whatever blahblah blah armageddon Itll be okay humans are too smart to go extinct Maybe youre right But its difficult to predict the distant future with a lot of certainty Whats really cool though is that if you embrace that uncertaintya simple argument can show that human extinction soon is actually more probable Its called the Doomsday argument Imagine a giant urn that contains either 10 balls numbered 1 to 10 or a million balls numbered 1 to a million Now you dont know which is the case but you are allowed to pull out one ball You go ahead and do that and it is ball number 4 Thats pretty strong evidence in favourof the 10 ball condition because drawing a four from a set of 1 through 10 is a one in 10 chance But drawing fourfrom a million different numbers is a one in a million chance By analogy you are also a numbered ball You are a human who knows approximately what your birth number is Its probably somewhere around 100 billion Thats how many other humans were most likely born before you were Importantly you didnt get to decide which birth number you would have So just like the number for a ball you are a random sample from the set of all humans who will ever live The Doomsday argument points out that from 200 billion people theres a50 percent chance that a randomly chosen person like you would be born in the first one hundred billion Whereas if there will be 10 trillion humans theres only a one percent chance that any given human say you would happen to be born within the first 100 billion Either you are special and lucky to be born so improbablyearly in the story of humanity or your birth number is to be expected because there will not be tens of trillions of humans Human extinction will be sooner rather than later But before you become too convinced that the end is nigh keepin mind that the Doomsday argument is not uncontroversial One problem it might have is a reference class problem Are you really a random sample from the set of all humans who will ever be born Well if you believe that in thenot so distant future humans will be quite different than they are today For instance therell be full of more 3D printed organs The mere fact that right nowthere arent very many humans with that trait could be evidence thatyou arent a random sample from the set of all humans just from the set of all humans like you like does around you Those born earlier in human history Also the Doomsday argumentdoesnt consider the likelihoods of actual threats or human advantages over those threats in the future It just assumes that we dont know which way the balance will lie that human extinction soon and human extinction later are equally likelyBut maybe you dont believe that Maybe you are convinced that human ingenuity will always stay one step ahead of any extinction event thrown at it You could be right but theres reason to doubt that optimism For example the Fermi paradox If it is likely that intelligentlife forms in our universe are capable of living for billions and billions of years where are they Why are the skies so silent Perhaps it is because extinction level threat events are just too common for intelligent life anywhere to ever catch up So does this mean we should just give up The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement think so Founded in 1991 its supporters believe that humans are a negative influence on Earth and always will be Thus we have a moral obligation to just stop reproducing right now and fade away But what would a computer do In a way thats kind what Tom 7 did He created aprogram that plays video games The program came up with noveltechniques and strategies for playing games and even exploited glitches humans didnt know about or at least hadnt told it about He also had theprogram play other games like Tetris which I think is relevant to our question The computer struggled tofigure out what to do You see the computer wasnt programmedto consider future repercussions far enough ahead to notice that stacking Tetriminos incertain ways made a big difference On one run when faced with imminent demise the computer did something eerie Rather than lose and receive a game over it just paused the game For ever Tom 7 describes the computers reasoning like this The only winning move is to not play And thats right If you pause a game for ever you will never lose that game But youll also never win that game or achieve a high score Now we might not know what achieving a sentient life high score in this universe means or whether or not were capable ofachieving one We might also sometimes panic when the future looks bleak But if we keep playing and keep learning chances are we could eventually figure it out and start playing really well So thanks for continuing to play for being here And as always thanks for

Would Headlights Work at Light Speed?,2015-02-25T22:02:54Z,12.383333333333333,9504836,251817,Hey Vsauce Michael here If you were driving in a car at the speed of light and you turned on your headlights what would happen Would light be able to come out or would your headlights just stay dark Or maybe light would come out but it just pull up inside the headlight like a overflowing sink Or maybe the light would come out but attwice the speed of light  at its normal speed plus the speed of your car No that doesnt sound right None of theseanswers sound right because of course there is no answer A car cannot travel at the speed of light Nothing that has mass can But come on you say there are thingsthat can travel at the speed of light Things that have no mass like photons Lets build a car out of light Okay Lets take that suggestion because imagining what it is like to be light brings up a lot of questions about light about why things are the way they are and about whether or not we are real In order to see what I mean we need totalk about C The speed of light It is Constant As long as you arentaccelarating you can move as fast or slow or in whatever direction you want and you will still always see light moving at light speed Even when light appears to slowdown as it passes through different materials the actual photons themselves are stillalways traveling at C Theyre just taking a longer path which takes more time This law always holds truebecause whenever you move relative to other things yourmeasurements of them and their measurements of you change When you move everything notmoving with you appears to you to be shortened in length and to be experiencing time more slowly Whereas to everything else it is youthat these changes happen to These changes really happen  just notnoticeably or measurably at the speeds we usually travel at For example while walking to yourrefrigerator for a snack you will measure your fridge to be a 100 quadrillionth of a meter nearer and thinner than youwould while at rest with it Youll also notice that it experiences time more slowly than you Each one of its secondswill be a 100 quadrillionth of a second longer than yours But your fridge will measure that these transformations arehappening to you These are small numbers but at speedsnearer the speed of light these changes can be dramatic As Imentioned in an earlier video to a particle racing toward Earth at999999999999991 the entire Earth would only appear to be 70 meters deep Our whole planet Now with all of this in mind lets take alook at headlights being used by a stationary ship and one that is moving at 99 percent the speed of light The Near Light Speed Ship would beflattened in the direction of its travel to us while a stationary one would not As theirheadlights come on the light coming from both ships travelsat the same rate The speed of a lights source doesntpush it faster The moving ships velocity does howevergive its headlight energy in the direction its headed causing ablue shift from the front and a red shift from behind Whats really cool though is that thisis just what we would see floating in space at restwith the stationary ship The crew of the fastmoving shipwouldnt see their beams only gradually gaining on them like we do they would see it exactlywhat the crew the stationary ships sees Light beams rapidly fleeing theirheadlights at the speed of light just as if they were moving at all Andheres why Lets say this distance is a light second The distance lighttravels in one second Which is 299792458 meters Now after one of our seconds sure enough both beams will have traveled a lightsecond But the crew of the moving ship measures light speed to be the same as us But how does that make senseI mean light hasnt traveled a light second from them yet No problem You see what theymeasure a light second to be is shorter than what we measure And they wouldnt agree that a second haspassed yet either Because of course to us time is slower for them They count onesecond finishing later then we do at which point their light has indeedtraveled one of their light seconds from them Observers will often disagree about time and space but thosedisagreements with always conspire to make sure they agree on one thingThe speed of light It is always the same for everyone But what if you were travelling at the speed of light Well the onlything that could do that would be a massless vehicle So fine lets assumethat we can build one Such a vehicle would travel with light Light would never even pull a tiny tiny bit ahead of it No matter how short it thought a meter was No matter how longit thought a second was It would never register light ever moving ahead of it It would say that light was stationaryIt would not agree that light travelled at the speed of light Right Not really You see at the speed of light there is nothing to see Not because theres nothing tosee but because there is nothing to do any seeing As we have seen as an objects velocity approaches C time for everything around it approaches a standstill An object traveling very very very very very verynear the speed of light could travel for billions of our years before a single second past for it But a massless vehicle travelling at the speed of light could travel forever before an instant even began for it It experiences no time And it would have no time to do anything Certainly no time to turn on its headlights The concept of time doesnt even really apply A massless vehicle couldnt evenhave its headlights on before it hits C because object with nomass must always travel at C Such an object would never have a before Its origin its journey and its destination are simultaneous for it A billion light year trip from a distant quasar might take a photon a billion years to us But it literally takes no time for the photon And to the photon thedistance to us from that quasar is literally nothing Photons are how we see How we know anythingabout our place in the universe and the energy they bring our planet from the Sun is responsible for nearly all life on Earth But despite that listof accomplishments they dont think much of themselves In fact as far as theyre concerned they dont even exist Outside observers of course see them and would measure them to bemoving along at the speed of light with nothing passing or gaining on themSo if you were moving at the speed of light youd have to be massless like a photon and you wouldnt notice anything because toyou there would be nothing and no time to notice it Other peoplewould see you doing nothing and you would be unaware of yourself Youcould never turn on headlights because you would feel exactly like youfelt before you were conceived But why is the speed of light what it is I mean this is how far light travels in a second Could it also travel this far or this far or this farCould we conceive of a universe where light traveled that quickly Yeah easily So then why is it that the universe we live in is only one of these ways Why are the laws of physics what they are Instead of some other way they could be Well there are a lot of theories but sofar were not exactly sure how to test any of them because we are stuck in this universe and dont yet know how tocreate universes of our own for experiments But perhaps there issomething we have yet to discover that compels reality to be this way and only this way  Or perhaps nothing compels it to be thisway but instead theres a multiverse Every single possible universe exists Some of them collapsedimmediately some of them are empty and dark some of them involve you watching this very video but Earth has two Suns For those of you in that universewatching that was probably very confusing what I just say because your Earth does have two SunsBut the point is the multiverse would be a pretty elegant explanation Or maybe universes are born inside black holes Universes whose physical laws are onlyslightly different from the universe that gave birth to it In this way universes could replicateaccording to natural selection Universes that are more fit for creating black holes would then have more baby universes making universes that support blackholes more common like maybe the one that were in And thatspretty lucky because universes that support black holes support Suns and us Or  and heres my favorite theory  maybe were just living in a simulationAnd someone or something else programmed it up That sounds pretty scifi Sure But I like how Julian Baggini puts it in The Pig That Wants to Be EatenIf you assume that at some point in time virtual reality could become good enoughthat even its own inhabitants didnt know they were in a simulationand if you assume creating such simulations would be way easier than creating realfleshandblood creatures that require an entire universeand billions of years Well then its pretty easy to conclude thatmany many many many more simulated faked beings could be created than real ones Say 999 fake ones for every one real one Whats more likely That youre part of the 01 that are real or that you are part the 999 who think theyre real but arent Perhaps we live in a simulationcreated by some other intelligent species John Gribbin however points out one possible way todismiss this idea irrational numbers Like the square root of 2  or Pi These numbers dont end I mean they contain a neverending never repeating sequence of digits whichwould mean that whoever programmed this universe could fit in all of say Pi So if in our tireless pursuit ofcalculating more and more and more digits of Pi we ever run into an endlessly repeating series or the end that could be a pretty good sign that we live in a simulation A universe that is not real But so far we havent found that and wedont think that we will So thank you irrational numbers for keeping it real And as always thanks for

Did The Past Really Happen?,2015-02-06T21:56:59Z,11.933333333333334,16808559,432666,Hey Vsauce Michael here The dog that played Toto in The Wizard of Oz wascredited as Toto but in reality the dogs name was Terry And when Terry died in 1945 her owner and trainer Carl Spitz buriedher on his ranch in Los Angeles But in 1958 the Ventura Highway was constructedright through Terrys grave Her remains were disturbed and have never been foundFiftythree years later a memorial was erected in HollywoodForever Cemetery in her honor but because she isnt burried there the memorial is not a grave Itswhats known as a cenotaph an empty tomb I was reminded of Totos cenotaph when I saw the cenotaph of Philopappos atop the Hill of the Muses in Athens You see I was recently inGreece talking about YouTube with YouTubecreators The all seen eye of Guy came along and wevisited the Acropolis a Lion Gate  nearly athousand years older than the Acropolis The earliest known analog computerPlenty of beautiful cats and I even took a selfie in Delphi Ive seen all of these things and how old they were it made me wonder howwill we be remembered How will future archaeologists react tothe ruins of todays society they find thousands of yearsfrom now Will they do a good job piecing it together Will anything about you inparticular be remembered And for that matter how do we even know that the past reallyhappened Not just the way we think it happenedbut it all Seriously can you prove that the universewasnt created last Thursday That everything  everyperson every memory you have every photo youve taken didnt just pop ininto existence last week or five minutes ago Last Thursdayism is the belief thatthe universe was created last Thursday It doesnt have actual followers or rituals but proving itwrong is impossible Not because the universe actually was created last Thursday butbecause Last Thursdayism is not also falsifiable It cannot be shown to be false In theevidence you bring up against it can be explained away as part of the everything that was created lastThursday Many people believe that in order for atheory and explanation to be scientific it mustbe possible to refute it to prove it wrong to test it So instead Last Thursdayism fallsinto the domain of philosophy where luckily there are razors  little rules of thumb that help shave off unlikelyexplanations The most famous is Occams Razor Whenfaced with the choice between explanations choose the one that requires diffusedassumptions Occams Razor can shave off last Thursdayism because it requires fewer assumptions to believe that saythis beehive tomb was constructed way back in theBronze Age and that I just visited it later than itdoes to believe that the tomb my memories of it and thisfootage of me inside it just happen to coincidentallypop into existence at the same time last Thursday One of my favouritephilosophical razors cuts off so much stuff its not even called a razor Its called Newtons Flaming Laser Sword It states if something cannot be settled byexperiment then it is not worthy of debate So lets move on to the past What does Newtons Flaming Laser Sword tell us about thepast I mean it doesnt exist in the same way gravity or light or protons do Wecant do experiments on it build control groups run trials The past just is what it was We will one day be the past and nomatter how well we try to record our stories ourselves without time machines future archaeologists aregoing to have to make a lot of guesses about us But thats kinda cool Future humans will likely know way morethan us today about medicine about exoplanets about physics But one thing they almost surely will not know more about than we do is today Will your great great great greatgrandkids know your name Will aliens who visitEarth millions of years after humans leave orgo extinct understand that Animorphs was just fiction and not a history of our people You are destined to become whatever thefuture thinks you were if youre lucky Vandals fire natural disaster conquerors thieves all of these forcesobscure facts overtime but no matter how well we triedto preserve today for future history books theresone type of fog we are unlikely to avoid Apathy Ira Glass put it well when he asked his listeners a simplequestion name 10 people from the 15th century We have records of more than 10 peoplebut to most of us they dont matter In five hundred years radio host will be making the same jokesbut about us However there is a legacyleave behind that is irreversible Immutable and in a way unforgettable To conserve energy turn off when not inuse Or just keep them on Energy will beconserved no matter what you do Even if you leavelights on all year there will be no less or more energy inthe universe Whats really being conserved when weturn off lights are the resources we turn into energy the lights can use But if you counted up all the energy in the system before andafter turning the lights on it would be the same Energy also doessomething else Unless hindered from doing so energy will spread out  it will disperse That is in so few words the Second Law ofThermodynamics Its how our universe works Its whythings that happen spontaneously do Energy spreads Even when a process locally concentratesenergy like when a crystal forms or life grows the Second Law isnt violated because theseprocesses arent independent from the larger worldaround them They arent 100 percent efficient Hindrances can holdback the inevitable spread of energy for a long time The Second Law doesnt say when energy will disperse  just that when it can  oh it will Balloons will deflate objects will fall hot objects will cooldown and perfume sprayed across the room willeventually migrate to your nose even in really still air How much or how widely energy has spread out ismeasured in entropy Entropy is often called disorder chaos But entropy is verydifferent from macroscopic messiness This deck of cards is themed after Greek philosophers Itsalso arranged by value and suit  the entire deck But if Itake the deck and shuffle it that is disorder it Ihavent actually increased the decks entropy because nothing about this deck of cards energy is different than it was beforeHowever entropy in the greater world around us has increased because in order toshuffle the cards my body has to do work It has to takeenergy concentrated in my cells and change and disperse that energy intokinetic energy movement and a little bit of heat frommy body and from the cards friction and a little bit of soundenergy  that rustling noise So theres your real legacy Your contribution to the universesgrowing entropy No process will be able to undo the net increase in entropy you accomplish in your life History mayforget you or misinterpret your accomplishments orwhat stood for The ripples you leave behind may getredirected but the universe will never be able toforget the entropy you add Thats the law The Second Law of Thermodynamics Many scientists believe that this meansthat eventually energy  heat  will be completely spread out evenly throughout the universe It will bethe same temperature everywhere and at that point nothingwill be able to happen Because in order for somethingto happen entropy needs to increase energy needsto spread the move to change This may be the ultimate fate of theuniverse   thermodynamic equilibrium The Heat Death of the universe Its been estimated thatat the rate things happen this end the universe will occur in about 8 googol years and youre contributingto it by simply existing A funny consequenceof all this is the fact that people who arent very active people who dont do much but lay around arent just being lazy In a way theyre being considerate Sloth maybe of vice but to the universe its a fountain of youth Choosing to do as littleas possible means consciously limiting yourcontribution to the inevitable dispersal of energy andthus in a teenytiny way postponing the Heat Death of our universe Relaxing adds time to the universes life in amount oftime to be fair almost indistinguishable from zero but still theoretically real Being lazy will make the universe last longer So thanks for chilling out  Thanks for taking it easy And as always thanks for

Is All Fair In Love And War?,2015-01-20T18:24:14Z,9.983333333333333,7204855,206871,Hey Vsauce Michael here Love and war are exactly alike It is lawful to use tricks and slights to obtain adesired end But is all fair in love and war Thats a good question lets pencil it in for this episode Of course pencil is not permanent It canbe erased Its not like whatever I write down isbeing chiseled into granite But pencil lead is made out of carbon atoms organised into a structure calledgraphite  a nonmetallic mineral with some metallicproperties found naturally in rocks which means things written inpencil though erasable are still technicallywritten in stone In video games if the bad guys really wanted to stopyou why did they walk around in such predictable patterns Wouldnt their chances be better if theyjust came right at you Theres a great name for this logic mook chivalry Its as if theres a sort of unwritten Geneva Convention that appliesto fictional baddies that respects not reality or what wouldmake sense but instead the higher purpose of fun and a good story But in real life we arent that much different from themooks We construct voluntary obstacles in theway of even honourable goals like truth justice or right over wrong Not all is fair in love and war And its the exceptionsthat make us who we are Torturing your enemies to get information from them to demoralise them or just for fun has been a might is right part of war since war began But in the second half of the 19thcentury Henry Dunant the founder of the Red Cross organizedan official moral code of warfare  The Geneva Conventions thattoday across its now 4 conventions has beenagreed to be followed by 196 nations And since then various other customs codes andprinciples have been established totaling up into what may now be calledthe Rules of war Their enforcement is handledby regional national and international powers Of course an unconcerned force would simply ignorethese rules because the quickest route to victory isthe one full of unfair advantages but nonetheless we treasure them Try to at least Andbelieve that all others should The values they recognise are telling Things unrelated to militarynecessity or valued in a sense more greatly thanimmediate victory are protected For instance TheEnvironmental Modification Convention prohibits controlling the weather andusing the weather as a weapon against youropponents Before the convention that happened For example duringOperation Popeye US airplanes seeded rain clouds overVietnam and successfully extended the monsoonseason by more than a month increasing rainfall by 30 percent  a movethat made enemy road surfaces muddy blocked by landslides washed out much less passable The laws of war protectcertain symbols Parties or infrastructures bearingsymbols that indicate there are only there to help or are neutralculturally important buildings that should be protected for posterity are off limits Its a violation of the laws of war to attack such targets or to pretend tobe such targets if your intentions are otherwise That is called perfidy A kind ofdeception that involves pretending to act fairly and honestly toinvite the confidence of an adversary only to then take advantage of thattrust betray it and kill injure or capture If you do one of those three thingswhile pretending to be dead or injured or surrendered or civilian ora noncombatant well thats a violation of the rules of war Espionage is allowed But if caught you can be prosecuted and punished Whereas if youare a lawful combatants on the other hand youre entitled to protection as an officialprisonerofwar Conditions like these reveal somethingwe desire to hold above quick vengeance dignity andrespect Both sides wish to be treated with thatand uphold the bargain Athletes agreedto play fair to avoid prohibited things eventechnically safe and otherwise legal things that wouldnonetheless give them an unfair advantage They do this becausethe spirit of the sport is more important to them then the quickest victory possible sportsmanship Likewise a sort of lovesmanship exists in US court rooms If the most surefire way of gettingthe truth of someones guilt involves spoiling a bond of love Spousalprivilege says chill Love is sacred Truth will come second find another way So if you are planning on committing crimesin the US and you need an accomplice marry them Your spouse can not be forced to testifyagainst you There are different privileges applyingto other relations of yours allowing them torefuse to give evidence against you These rules exist to honoursomething that we deem or like to deem greater than easy victoryYou cannot travel faster than light Or escape from a black hole Or commitperfidy in a time of war Or cheat on yoursignificant other Thats usually considered unfair but the final two arent physicallimitations of matter They are voluntary obstacles reflecting what we value Whether we respect thosevalues or not is another story And how we interpret what actions are overthe line and what arent is a matter of judgment We didnt get tocreate protons or planets  they were alreadyhere But we do get to create judgments We even named ourselves after thatability We call ourselves Homo sapiens Homomeaning hummus  the soil we are from the earthSapien mean sapiens the ability to make wisejudgments Very few people would argue that alltruly is fair in love and war but in love and war behaviours otherwise not acceptable canbe not only forgiven but recommended Reading messages notmeant for yourself using disguises even murder can bedowngraded to a crime of passion or lawful combat But love and war put different things atstake And just because unfair things areexpected during love and war doesnt mean that within theirrespective domains we prosecute or prohibit unfairness in the same way Violating the law of war is a crime but there is no official law of love You can prosecute someone for perfidy ordesertion or weaponising the weather but you cant prosecute cupid for heartbreak You cant have someone arrested for notloving you back and you shouldnt call 911 if someone leaves you for someone else You see there is no Geneva Conventionfor love Furthermore we often route for friendsor fictional characters who follow theirhearts even if it means leaving someone we care less for  a minor character for instance  alone orstranded at the altar Does this mean that love is a betterexcuse for bad behavior than war Obviously not for criminal behaviour butotherwise As far as authoritative powers and ourmodern conception of love are concerned war  its technologies and strategies arehuman invention Whereas love is a human condition Love is like inertia or death  inevitable A law of nature and blameless if unkind We legislate where a bomb can fall where debris can fall and prosecutethose who violate those rulings But we dont prosecute gravity formaking things fall We support voluntaryrestrictions on fair play in sports more  public etiquette But the players in loves battlefield are blameless victims of their passion even if thosepassions are nonsensical The heart has itsreasons which reason knows nothing of Deceivingothers that is what the world calls a romanceMaybe love has this power intrinsically or maybe we give it that power byleaving so legally alone But either way broken bones are the domain of law Broken hearts are the domain of aww shucks sorry And as always thanks for

Is Cereal Soup?,2015-01-02T00:54:43Z,8.366666666666667,7158804,207904,Hey Vsauce Michael here Take a look at this Simple enough right But watch what happens next   Okay what the heck is this thing Mostly people eat it like a soup out of a  bowl with a spoon  But is it a soup The word soup comes from words that originally meant  to absorb liquid which dry cerealleft in milk too long will do But words change What if cereal is actually a type of salad And milk is just a dressing Or maybe dry cereal is the actual meal and milk is just a condiment or a coating Adding milk to dry cereal might be like adding ketchup to french fries or icing a cake Honestly there is no real answer The answer is whatever we agree the answer should be We make up the words and we make up the categories If you ask me cereal is soup but its notsoup soup Cereal is also salad but its not salad salad What I just did there iscalled reduplication We do it all the time but usually for emphasis For example  I like you but I also like like you Tomorrows event is fancy but its not fancy fancy When I say soup soup or salad salad I am using reduplication in a way that is knownas Contrastive focus reduplication I am reduplicating a word to express a focus on prototypicaltypes of that word in contrast to French types A Caesar or vegetable are more prototypical types of salad than say potato taco fruitor a bowl of cereal with milk The increasing progress of technology forcesus to contrastively focus reduplicate more and more often For example now when talking about a book you might need to clarify whether it is anebook or a book book The original physical paper type The phrase paper book is a retronym A modification to an old word made necessaryby the advent and popularisation of something new Before movies with sound came along silent movies were just called movies Before voicemail and email snail mail wasjust mail And before mobile phones your landline orhome phone was simply a phone Or in many cases just the phone This is Morse code for a smiley face emoticon Its a happy beat The eyes of the emoticon are a colon which up until as recently as the middle of the1900s was often used with a dash to represent a pause It was an especially helpful direction to people reading text out loud It was used all over the place In personal letters and all over Americas Declaration of Independence You may also notice that it looks a little bit  anatomical The Oxford English Dictionary has a name for this punctuation mark and that name is the dogs bollocks In other words dog balls Although other emoticons were definitely used earlier as far as official dictionary entriesare concerned the very first emoticon with an official name was an emoticon for a willy This also means that Americas Declaration of Independence is  punctuationwise covered in dog wieners Nine of them to be exact What Im about to do is called drawing When I am finished what I have created is called  a drawing But its finished Shouldnt it be called a drawn A similar version of this problem is oftenattributed to Steven Wright Why are they called buildings if they are finished Shouldnt they be called builds Whats really going on here is a phenomenon known as verbal nouns A noun formed from a verb Its often easier to nounify a verb thanto just use lots of words Why call this a structure resulting from theactive of building when you could just call it a building Where does the word nickname come from Did a guy name Nicholas one day decided everyonecould call him Nick and in doing so create a literal nickname No Nickname is a product of rebracketing A process in which speakers often unknowingly create new words by moving sounds from one word to another For instance the English word alligator isa corruption of the Spanish el lagarto  the lizard El lagarto el lagarto el alligator Eke used to mean also as in you could have a name and you could have another name that was also your name Your eke name  Eke name Eke name Ni ni nickname Heres another funny thing about language If youre noisy in class youre disrupting class But if you sit around silently paying attention are you rupting class You can be disgruntled but can you ever be gruntled Words that would seem to have a related wordbut actually do not are called unpaired words Maybe they were in a pair at one point inhistory or maybe through a fluke of etymology they only seem to have one but what you thinkit would be isnt in any dictionary Some definitions like soup and salad areso vague their borders are almost hilariously fuzzy Other words well theyre just plain silly For example the sun does not rise every morning The Earth actually just turns you toward it but yet our word for that phenomenon is sunrise Languages are full of expressions like that George Steiner wrote colourfully about thissaying The accelerando of the sciences and of technology have beggared both the reach and veracity of natural language  In consequence the commonplace relations of language to phenomenonto our daily context have become virtually infantile They are a bricabrac of innermetaphors of whory fictions and handy falsifications From the perspective of the theoretical andexact sciences we speak a kind of neanderthal babble Whether spoken or typed or tabbed or felt or signalled language may be inevitably full of idiomatic expressions and expressions that are incomplete And categories that are fuzzy But hey at least its our fuzz and at least fuzz is entertaining It would be nice to just know everything and have absolutely nothing to explain or demonstrate to anyone else But then again as Emily Dickinson once said a letter is a joy of earth It is deniedthe Gods If we were all omniscient wed have no reasonto write letter to one another there wouldnt be anything new you had to tell someone else We would have no reason to debate the soupiness or saladness of cereal No reason to wonder no reason to read or to watch Id have no reason to say and as always thanks for watching,129.203187250996,prototypicaltypes,0.0,1.0,O9ak89FwYeI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9ak89FwYeI
Is Earth Actually Flat?,2014-12-04T19:34:10Z,10.516666666666667,36861116,733723,Hey Vsauce Michael hereIn 2003 researchers did the measurements and found that Kansas is in fact literallyflatter than a pancake Of course the Earth is not flat the Earthis round Otherwise travellers would be falling offthe edge all the time Right Wrong If the Earth was not a ball shaped but wasinstead a flat disk like this plate well with the weight density and thickness livingin the middle could feel pretty normal But as you move toward the edge gravity on a disk Earth would slightly skew pushing at a greater and greater angle back toward the centre My friend Nick from yeti dynamics put togetherthis great simulation The person and buildings obviously arentto scale but check out how such increasingly diagonal gravity would workAlthough this is a flat disk it would feel to a runner headed toward the edge like they were fighting to climb up a steeper and steeper hill The building foundations behind the runner reflect how you would have to build structures closer and closer to the edge so that people living in them always felt like down was atright angles to the floor  the way we feel it on our big round EarthAs you approach the edge things would get scary Remember this is a flat Earth but it would feel like a sheer drop off Whats really cool is that contrary to the dont fall off the edge fear on a flatworld because of gravity the scary risk would actually be falling away from the edge androlling all the way back to the centre Once you stepped over the edge instead offalling off into space youd be able to relax It would be a nice level place This model of course neglects the fact that such a planet shape would be impossible Anything as massive as the Earth shaped like a flat disc would under its own gravitynaturally collapse back into a ball This is why in outer space everything morethan few hundred miles in diameter is round Or so weve been toldWhat if gravity isnt real What if the Earth is in fact flat and sciencehas been wrong all along Its a misconception that Christopher Columbusdiscovered that the Earth is round Virtually every scholar and major religionin the West accepted Earths rotundity since at least the time of the Ancient Greeks whofor instance had noticed that boats disappear bottom first when sailing awayAnd as you walk north and south stars pop in and out of the view The misconception that only a few hundred years ago lots and lots of people believedthe Earth was flat likely began in the modern era as a sort of insultWell your people recently thought the Earth was flat so why should we believe you nowThe smear was repeated and published so often it became accepted as historical factFlatEarther became synonymous with Antiscience It might seem flat over short distances butover longer ones well the Earth is pretty darn curvy The Verrazano–Narrows Bridge connecting Staten Island and Brooklyn had to be designedwith Earths roundness in mind Its 2 towers separated by 1300 metres andperfectly vertical are nonetheless 41 milimetres further apart at the top than at the bottom because of Earths curvature In the 3rd century BC Eratosthenes measuredthe differences between shadows cast by poles in Syene and Alexandria to calculate morethan 2000 years before rockets and space travel the circumference of the entire globular Earthwith for the time impressive accuracy Word got around that the Earth was a roundshape after that But in 1906 Wilbur Glenn Voliva became headof a slightly bizarre religious sect that pretty much ran the city of Zion Illinois Voliva believed that the Earth was actually flat and he enforced flat Earths teachingsin schools in Zion He also enforced that belief on really anyonewho entered the city Voliva believed not only that the Earth wasflat but that the sun was only few thousand miles away from EarthNot 93 million He also believed that the sun was only 32miles across not 860 000 He sounds crazy or does heYou see the same phenomenon Eratosthenes measured could be explained by a flat Earthif the sun were only few thousand miles away and 32 miles across  the math would workout the same Today with the power of the Internet modernday flat Earthers have picked up where Voliva left off They have quite good explanations for any evidence you throw at them that the Earth is round Circumnavigation is really just a flat circle path The round shadow Earth casts on the Moon duringa lunar eclipse could also be made by a flat discTime zones are caused by spotlight sun and remember how gravity would be totally differenton a discshaped planet Well they argue that gravity as we knowit simply doesnt exist The flat disc of Earth is merely acceleratingup at 98 metres per second As for all of the photos and video evidencewe now have that the Earth is round thanks to space exploration well all of that materialis completely fabricated A hoax perpetrated by Big GlobeSpace agencies airlines globe manufacturers They are reaping the rewards of our ignorantbelief that the Earth is actually round They know of course that its flatAnd theyre hiding that truth from us Is it merely a coincidence that the logo usedby the Flat Earth Society is a projection of Earth centred on the North Pole and alsohappens to be the projection used by the United Nations Are these people for real Probably not most of themBut this is the crocks of Poes Law An adage that states that at their extremesparody of extremism and sincere extremism are difficult to distinguish Although clever flat Earth theories are predominantly ad hoc explanations  excuses made up on thespot that only address one issue and dont fit all the evidence Science of course rejects a theory if a better one fits more of our observationsbut why the egoistical obsession with OUR observations A cosmic ray particle could use the very same scientific method we use and conclude thatthe Earth was in fact flat You see at speeds near the speeds of lighttime slows down and lengths contract One way we know this is that unstable muonscreated in the upper atmosphere by the collision of cosmic rays with the atmosphere shouldmostly decay before reaching Earths surface But yet we detect a lot of them down herebecause theyre crazy fast speed literally means that from our perspective their physicsruns according to a slower clock and to them the distance they have to cover to the surfaceduring their short lives is from their perspective much much shorter than it appears to usIf youre a cosmic ray proton travelling at 999999999999991 the speed of light Earthwould appear to be only 17 metres thick in the direction you travel So Earth is flat to them but round to us It is ball shaped to some observers and flat to others There doesnt appear to be a single most correctestin all circumstances answer Susan Haack compares knowledge to a crossword puzzle New answers interweave with old ones theyall reinforce one another The clues are the questions we ask and theway the answers fall into a predetermined grid well thats our confidence that wereon the right track But that doesnt mean one day there will bea finished puzzle  a complete answer Recall The New York Times famous 1996 crosswordpuzzle that came out the day before the US election between Bill Clinton and Bob DoleThe clue for 39 across was pretty crazy You seemed to need to be able to tell thefuture to answer it correctly It simply said Lead story in tomorrows newspaper blank elected Well that blank could be Clinton or Bob Doleand whos to say which one until tomorrow Theres no way to knowBut as it turned out the answer was Clinton or Bob DoleNo matter which you wrote in all the other clues fitFor instance a black Halloween animal could either be a cat or a bat Our knowledge about the outside world might be the same A puzzle with no answer key just the reassurance that the answers we think we know fit togetherso theyre probably correct Though theres always the possibility thatthe answer to one clue or all of them will fundamentally not have a single definite satisfying answer The puzzle may be playable forever I like what Richard Feynman says about this Some people say How can you live withoutknowing I do not know what they mean I always live without knowing  that is easyHow you get to know is what I want to know You know And as always thanks for

Misnomers,2014-11-11T18:21:57Z,11.433333333333334,10009344,288569,Hey Vsauce Michael here Im sorry Look I didnt name myself butapparently Michael is the ninth most disliked baby name for a boy   according to a survey by BabyNameWizardcom At least it didnt top the charts like the rhyming  a den names  Jayden Brayden Aiden The most disliked name for a baby girl by the way was Nevaeh   heaven backwards Names can be more than justcontroversial  they can also be just plain wrong or misleading MISNOMERS And Im not talking about the daughter of Mr Nomer Over the summer I went to Singapore and I saw many many things I saw an infinity pool the worlds largestcolumnless glass house beautiful beautiful orchids including the laboratories where scientistsgenetically design custom orchids and very very humid air that condensed all over my cool glasses But even after I cleaned my glasses off I didnt see any Lions In fact its believed that no Lions have ever naturally lived in Singapore even though Singapore comes from a Malay word for Lion City Its believed that in 1299 when Sang Nila Utama named Singapore he mistakenly thought that a tiger he saw was a Lion Its a misnomer But here is the biggest mystery of them all did I really go to Singapore I mean look at these photos That guy certainly looks like me but hes not exactly like me I have made a video about misnomers and that guy hasnt This photo was from May and since May I have been to Australia New Zealand The guy in these photos has never been there I am similar to that guy but hes not exactly me We can resolve this problem by realising that oranges are apples You see in Old English the word apple was used to describe apples but also any fruit in general For instance dates were finger apples and bananas were apples of paradise Cucumbers were Earth apples In French the word for apple acted similarly giving us Earth apple for the potato In the Middle Ages the old French word for orange meant apple of the orange tree And the Swedish word for orange still means apple from China because Oranges originated in the East But this leads us to an even biggerquestion what came first orange the fruit or orange the colour Well the answer is neither The tree came first The word orange comes from the Sanskritword for the tree that these fruits grow on Before being introduced to these fruits the Englishspeakingworld called this colour not orange but yellowred The first recorded use of the wordorange to refer to the colour instead of the fruit wasnt until 1512 So the colour was named after the fruit which was named after the tree that it came from But whats a fruit Well botanically a fruit is a part of aflowering plant that disseminates seeds like an apple or an orange or a lemon or a grape In cooking because theyre not sweetwe tend to call things like wheat grains and bean pods vegetables even though they are actually fruits Vegetable is a culinary term for otheredible parts of a plant that arent fruit like roots or leaves Corn on the cob tastes like a vegetable but scientifically corn kernels are fruits which means that corn on the cob is really just a bunch of fruits packed together One of the veggies we put on our pizza is the mushroom Of course mushrooms arent really vegetables because they arent even plants Theyre fungi Names can also be confusing because of Stiglers Law  our tendency to name things not after who discovered them ororiginated them but instead to simply honour someone else Venn diagrams are cool They were named after John Venn in the 1880s although Leonhard Euler actually introduced them in 1768 And Avogadros Constant Not actually discovered by Avogadro He proposed that such a number could exist but it was a different guy who discovered the exact figure Straight up misnomers are my favorite French horns are not French Your Funny bone is not a bone its a nerve The Ulnar nerve And this is not Big Ben Nothing about this is officially called Big Ben Its real name is The Elizabeth Tower People often say that the bell inside is named Big Ben but even thats not true The main bell inside Elizabeth Tower is officially called The Great Bell The Great Bells nickname is Big Ben and we have since applied that nickname for a bell to the entire tower Kosher salt isnt actually kosher its just used to make things kosher to draw blood out of meat So really it should be called Koshering salt The Rocky Mountain Oyster of courseis not seafood  its a fried bull testicle Arabic Numerals are not Arabic they were invented in India but introduced to Europe by Arab mathematicians Haleys comet is named after Edmund Hayley but had been witnessed by people at least as early as 240 BC Peanuts are not nuts theyre legumes and coconuts are not nuts theyre drupes  stone fruit like cherries apricots peaches etc French fries as they are especially known in America are not from America but were probably named byBritish and American soldiers during the First World War who discoveredthem where they were likely invented Belgium Now since French was the official language of the Belgian Army the soldiers may have mistakenly thoughtthey were in

it involves lots of wet liquids but just not water And silly guy hamburgers are notnamed after ham the pork product theyre named afterHamburg Germany Probably because at Hamburg citizens who emigrated

want to confuse us butbecause the park in parkways refers not to stopping a car but to thenature parks parkways often run along Skeuomorphs are design elements that today are merely ornamental even though in the past originally they had a purpose For instance on a modern mobile phone the icon for phone call is shaped like an old phone The icon for email is shaped like an old snail mail envelope Or when you take a camera phone picture you hear the sound of a mechanical shutter even if your phone doesnt have one thatmakes that noise Older cameras did so the new ones do too Its a skeuomorph Your own name is a kind of skeuomorph Lets call it a skeuonom It was necessary at birth your parents gave it to you but beforethey knew exactly what you would be like when you grew up You have changed since you were born but your name has stayed the same When we called it The Moon we didnt know that we would find other moons in the solar system When youwere named no one knew how you would change or what you would become and you change frequently You change many many times over the course of your life You learn things you forget things you meet people you stoptalking to people You experience things for the first timeat a cellular level millions of times a second you changecostume cells die and new ones are born And at the atomic level with theexception of nonliving things like tattoos and piercings every five years pretty much every single atom in yourbody is replaced So to what degree is the future or past you really you now Robert M Martin puts this in a really cool perspectivein his book There Are Two Errors in the the Title of This Book That person who will have your name in the very far future will be connectedonly very tenuously to the present you The person will remember very few ofyour current experiences will be psychologically quite differentwill have a body that resembles your present one only a bit and contains almost none of the same matter So it seems that this person is thefuture you only to a small degree In a way in terms of memories and experiences in history you have more in common with astranger today than you do with yourself 10 or 20years ago Martin goes even further saying why be afraid of death if the future you who dies will resembleyou today so little Well to that I say YOLO Well its probably more accurateto say

Why Are We Morbidly Curious?,2014-10-08T09:56:00Z,13.85,8634098,205737,Hey Vsauce Michael here In 1924 psychologist Carney Landis drew lines on peoples faces and then photographed them in variousscenarios to study facial expressions But he didnt use actors and he didnt tell the participants topretend to feel emotions Instead he subjected them to actual trauma He had them do things like smell ammonia look at pornographic images and even reach their hand in buckets of wet slimy frogs His most intense directive involved ordering them to take a knife and while being photographed cut off the head of a living rat Seriously Most initially refused to cut the head offbut eventually twothirds agreed to do as they were told including a 13yearold boy referred tothe psychology department by a doctor for high blood pressure thought to becaused by emotional instability Many believe his inclusion in Landis experiment was an accident If replicated today Landis might be arrested but what is psychologically arrestingabout these images is that the unease and disgust and fear they show is real Its disturbing but fascinating We are paradoxically drawn towards somepretty repulsive things car accidents car chases the possibility of a crash or a fight or a natural disaster I mean not one that hurts anyone of course but one thats exciting Celebrity scandal drama disfiguration true crime war and gore the macarbe Like the Kangling a trumpet used during Himalayan Buddhist ritualsthats made out of a human leg bone We often feel guilty for being interested in these types of things after all they are unpleasant but yet we cant look away Why Well there is no single reason there aremany of them but they can be mould into a mnemonic We like disturbing things because we like to scream They give us strength catharsis reality exploration acceptance and meaning Watching someone eat gross tasting jellybeans or a ghost pepper or a spoonful of cinnamon or suffer in more extreme ways is a kindastrange thing to like to do but its part of what keeps us alive We are curious even if the outcome could be bad We often find uncertainty moreunpleasant than unpleasant certainty At least if we look we know Theres a neurological basis forexploring in the face of danger We become more attentive and alert when we are frightened which makessense Neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine are released when we are scared physically and mentally preparing us to take on a threat or successfully escape from it Dopamine is famously part of the brains reward system Dopamine is released in response to pleasurable things like sex and food but that doesnt mean our brains find disturbing thingspleasurable Its more interesting than that When dopamine systems are inhibited in laboratory animals they will cease to seek out food and literally starve to death becausethey no longer find food fun No If food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and express signs of satisfaction Evidence like this suggests that the brain contains systems that motivate seeking approaching and curiosity for their own sake This has implications in the study of compulsive behaviour Just because you want to do something doesnt mean you like it The rush of chemicals into our brains and bodies when we are scared help us When the threats are real But if the threats arent real or if we are safely distant from them and merely spectating the same chemicals still appear making us more attentive more curious and making it more difficult to look away In the early nineteen hundreds EugèneLouis Doyen published incredibleimages of corpses he cut into stackable slices The images are amazingly macarbe but yet utterly fascinating and a wonderful reminder of what we are literally made of We often feel like we need an excuse like Halloween or anatomy homework inorder to look at things like that without coming across as a total weirdo I mean come on if you look too interested inthe macarbe it might look like you are into approve of or enjoy the gruesome Funny enough that guilt may very well fuel our desire to look in the first place Sometimes pressure to not do something canactually make people more likely to do that thing Its called The Boomerang Effect There are many different ways for things to boomerang one is The Streisand Effect when trying to suppress something unintentionally makes it more widely distributed In 2003 Barbra Streisand sued to suppress a photo published online as part of aCalifornia Coastline Preservation Project One of the photos the one she was trying to get rid of showed her house Within a month of the lawsuit going public nearly half a million people had floodedthe website and downloaded the picture Before the suit only six people had downloaded the image two of which were her lawyers In a similar fashion social pressuresand tabboos against viewing disturbing things can make them more interesting rarer and so a more valuable commodity and also free in that deliberately viewing them can demonstrate to ourselves and others that we are free and can do what we want Disturbing things can also make us feel stronger because their repulsiveness is a challenge Glenn Sparks at Purdue University has studied the way terrifying films affect us After watching them viewers often feel stronger satisfied that they didnt chicken out that they made it through they conquered something disturbing and were able to handle it Its almost a form of practice As StephenKing put it We make up horrors to help us cope with the real ones On the more negative side followingcelebrity scandals or seeing defeat on the faces of the rival team can make you feel pretty good Itscalled Schadenfreude which means harm joy getting pleasure from others misfortunes Social comparison theory describes and predicts behavior like thisalthough grades and rankings cause anxiety we nonethelesspossess a drive to seek out evaluations of ourselves in comparison to others we especiallyenjoyed the evaluations that put us on top Now causing other people to be less well off sort of makes sense under this lens If its relative happiness youreconcerned with trolling or harassing or griefing other people sort of works it doesnt make you happier but compared to the peopleyoure annoying you are less annoyed So yay Viewing scenes of anger and vengeance and violence that dont even involve us can nonetheless cause our own anger and aggression to burn off as though theyre being satisfied Its called catharsis a cleanser a purification Creating images and moviesand stories that play with our emotions might be grasping at low hanging fruit A task beneath such logicalcreatures as ourselves Or it might be a powerful demonstration of the fact that we have control or atleast a leash around how we feel We condemn the actions of serial killers but nonetheless oftentreat them like rock stars Web sites like RedrumAutographs and Serial Killers Ink sell autographs souvenirs trinketsand works of art made by real serial killers Some call it murderabilia On a spectrum ofpetty thrills and morose voyeurism to complete overwhelming obsession and fear our relationship with the morbid iscomplicatedm but it is under our control if were aware of our actions One of the mostconstructive and socially important uses of the morbid is the facilitation of meaning acceptance and empathy In his book Everyone Loves a Good Train Wreck Eric G Wilson says that our attractionto the macabre is on some level a desire to experience someone elses suffering Morbid curiosity is often about theimagination Imagining what it would be like to be thatother person what if that happened to me Could it happen to me Empathetic feelings remind us that ourtime is limited and that we are fragile and in doing sobring us closer together Sure enough the lastmovie I watched it made me want to go out and hug the very first friend I could find wasnt a happy feelgood comedy Instead it was Louis Therouxs somber Extreme Love Dementia Viewing unpleasant things doesnt always make them less unpleasantor any less real but thats not always the point Morbidcuriosity is also about acceptance Remember our brains are wired with motivationsto explore unpleasant things because doing socan be preferable to ignorance Gawking at morbidity is often about asking why There must be a reason a meaning behind all of this When tragedy strikes or horrors arerevealed we listen to experts give opinions neighbors describe the killer we look forsigns that were missed and confirmation that others feel the sameway we do that people are helping or making surejustice is served Katelin Dodi the host of Ask aMortician here on YouTube just wrote a phenomenal book Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and OtherLessons from the Crematory In the book she says accepting death doesnt mean that you wont bedevastated when someone you love dies it means you will be able to focus onyour grief unburdened by bigger existential questions like why do people die And why is thishappening to me Death isnt happening to you death is happening to us all Thats heavy stuff but acceptance like that is one of thegreatest things morbid curiosity has to offer and dont worry theres a funny side to all of this or at least a funny side related to this and how morbidity helps us make sense of the world A study in Finland found that children were fourtimes as likely to be scared by their usual television programs if a parent was in the room It surprised researchersbut one explanation lies in the Uh oh Mom flinched theory The idea is that to a young child almosteverything is brand new but parents are older theyre wiser they know whats normal and if they are scared of whats on TV uh oh How we feel and how we feel abouthow we feel is to a large degree learned Theres atheory about the origin of humor called the encryption theory of humor Itsuggests that one of the great roles humor plays is in measuring who is inside andwho is outside who is similar and who is sociallyor ideologically too different Jokes test whatresearchers call unstated common knowledge the teller andlistener both share So might we be morbidly curious for the same reason weenjoy telling jokes Jokes assess underlying shared attitudes Morbidity helps us asses shared underlying attitudes of an existential variety morality and justice Whether its used for empathetic orexploitative reasons morbidity and laughter may share a similar adaptive role We are morbidlycurious because we like to scream but morestrangely the yukand the yuk yuk overlap And as always thanks for watching,127.29241877256318,followingcelebrity,0.0,0.3,ZbdMMI6ty0o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbdMMI6ty0o
Spooky Coincidences?,2014-09-10T14:49:01Z,14.75,31118378,753508,Hi Vsauce Michael here You can practice speaking backwards so when your words are reversed their intelligible But heres somethingelse that is weird The digits in the speed of light areexactly the same as the latitude of the Great Pyramid of Giza And as the anagram genius has revealed all the worlds a stage but if you rearrange the lettersin the meaning of life it becomes be engine of a film or more pessimistically the fine game of nil What does all of this mean Are these just coincidences Or are greater powers at work Why is it so easy for us to find hidden messages Why can a merecoincidence give us chills and why is it so fun When you reverse Neil Armstrong saying small step for man you can hear what sounds like man willspace walk Lee Harvey Oswald assassinatedPresident John F Kennedy and this interview he defends the FairPlay for Cuba committee of which he was a member  Now listen to what itsounds like when we reverse him saying and the Fair Play for Cuba is that a coincidence or a subconsciousconfession hidden within his own words Its a coincidence For crying out loud if anybody says andthe Fair Play for Cuba and then reverses it it sounds the same This app by the way is calledVirtual Recorder Its a really easy way to quickly reverseyour own speech Matthew Hutson in The 7 Laws of Magical Thinking points out that if you record yourself saying and then reverse it it sounds a bit like happy birthday toyou Kind of If a word can be spelt thesame forward and backward its a palindrome But if a word or phrase sounds the same whether spoken forwardor rewound it is a phonetic palindrome For example say yes Reversed Pretty cool But  check out this poem byKarsten Johansson By the way some people can speak inreverse on the fly It is really cool to see them in action Watch Guys lean back after this video Its linked down in thedescription and its full of pretty cool coincidence videos Apophenia is the perception ofconnections or patterns in information One type of Apophenia is Pareidolia  the scene or hearing of things thatwerent meant to be there For instance hearing your name beingcalled or your phone ringing in the sound of running water orhearing English words in a nonEnglish song or seeing faces that werent purposely placed there Ourbrains are good at this kind of work probably because being hyperattentive to patterns and faces can save your life If theres ambiguityas to whether that thing hiding in the shadows is a threat or just a shadow its advantageous to air on the side of threat Organisms with a healthy sense of Apophenia live longer long enough to have kids andraise them and naturally become the norm We connectwith faces so well Hutson relates a story ofa friend who draws faces on things she doesnt wanna loselike her bags She says the faces make her less likely toforget about them If you like it you should have put aring on it if you like not losing it you should have drawn a face on it We are so good at teasing out patterns and faces fromrandom noise actual random sequences dont always feel random to us Originally Apples iTunes shuffle feature generatedcomplaints from users They said that similar songs or songsfrom the same artist appeared in a string which of course isto be expected from randomness but it didnt feelrandom enough So Apple introduced a smart shuffle that avoided totally random sequencesthat nonetheless didnt seem random to our patternloving brains As Steve Jobs explained were making itless random to make it feel more random Our impressive ability to imaginepatterns also expresses itself when it comes to connecting songs and moving images This dancingSpiderMan animation will famously sync up with any music you play Try it What kind of black magic is going onhere Well as it turns out most of it is inour heads Radiolab reported that MichiganState University explains that the major movements of dancing animations like this one or this one move at typical song tempos but alsocontain like most dance various other different related rhythms of movement allowing them to seemingly  fit many different tempos Selection bias helps a lot too We fall prey to this when we reject all the times the animation doesnt really sync up focusing insteadon the more surprising times when it does The bizarre pyramid coincidence mentioned earlier is a lot less bizarre when you considerthe fact that we got to control where we placed the decimal point and that a number of degrees this preciseisnt necessary to locate the pyramid By the fourth decimal were only talkingabout a matter of a few meters so its easy to make the rest fit thespeed of light exactly and have still picked a point on the pyramid Confirmation bias also comes into play here If you really want two things to sync up they will We often look for evidence that supportswhat we already believe while marginalising things against it As Marshall McLuhan said I wouldnthave seen it if I hadnt believed it These biases also help explainthe seemingly mindblowing coincidence that famous movies and famous albums can line up One the most popular states that if youstart playing Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon at the same time as The Wizard of Ozthey will eerily line up Entire communities have sproutedaround the syncing of movies and albums Some of myfavorites are the Yellow Submarine soundtrack and the Little Mermaid Lordes Pure Heroine and Twilight Saga  Breaking Dawn 2 and the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey with Pink Floyds Echoes There are conspiracies that these were somehow secretly planned though in reality theyre just accidental music videos Theproduct of selection bias confirmation bias and the law of near enough A behaviour of our pattern sensitiveminds Two things dont have to line up exactly or literally for us to see a connection This is whyvague predictions are a great way to look psychic Theseare also actually unsurprising when you consider the factthat the number of narrative paces and rhythms we enjoy andtypically use are much smaller than the number possible In The Improbability Principal David JHand calls this the probability lever What may be rare on average or when considering allpossible scenarios can be less rare for specific scenarios even if they are only marginallydifferent Getting struck by lightning is a proverbially unlikely event butWalter Summerford wasnt just struck by lightning onceduring his life he was struck three times It never killed him but four years after hisdeath his gravestone was also struck bylightning What are the chances I mean clearlySummerford was some sort of robot built out of lightning rods or had somehow angered Zeus right Probably not You see while for theaverage person the chance have been struck by lightningis quite low for an avid outdoor sportsman like Summerford its not as low The law of truly large numbers also comes into play here With lightning striking Earth forty tofifty times a second billions of people for it to strike and thousand of years of recorded history itsactually not surprising at all that at least once a story like Summerfords would have happened Given the truly large number of people who visit Disney World every day and the fact that they take photos and lots of them its actually not surprising at all thatat least one so far a story like Alex and Donna Voutsinas has happened While sorting through old photos beforetheir wedding Alex and Donna found a photo of Donna at Disney World fourteen years beforethe couple met But then Alex noticed something He too had visited Disney World as a child and there in the background was his father pushinghim in a stroller Sometimes coincidences can be tragic In 1864 Abraham Lincolns son Robert Lincoln was saved fromserious injury  or possibly even death  when a stranger grabbed him by the shirt collar moments before he plunged on the traintracks below That stranger turned out to be EdwinBooth one of the most famous Shakespearean actors of the time So famous in fact Robert recognized him and had a letter sent thanking himfor saving his life Less than a year later Edwin Booths brother John Wilkes Boothundid the favor by assassinating Abraham Lincoln Strange as they seem at first math says that given enough time andpsychology says that given enough interest in finding them coincidences and connections will be found even unlikely ones The coincidences between Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy are famous Both were elected to the presidency inthe year ending with sixty Lincoln was shot at Fords Theatre Kennedy was shot in a 1961 LincolnContinental fourdoor convertible made by Ford Both presidents last names have seven letters and both assassins had 15 letters intheir names The list goes on as it should If you look long enough you can findcoincidences between any two people or things or events They may seem strange at first but tend towind up being in the end pretty expected For just one example name length isnt that wildly variable Sevenletter names are pretty commonLincoln Kennedy Michael Stevens In the famous spooky presidentialcoincidences contest held by the Skeptical Inquirer in 1992one contestant alone found similar lists of crazycoincidences between 21 pairs of former presidents Given the vast amount of details in any oneof our lives its pretty easy This court can beexploited to almost comedic heights when it comes to overanalysing Of course hidden messages and signs are often intentionally included in media for fun or to reward attentive viewers But unintentional extraordinary things happen all the time Its not really that extraordinary Theres a famous calculation that is known as Littlewoods law Giventhe number of hours we are awake every day andassuming an event only takes about a second to occur if you calculate the odds of something happening to you are only one in a million Well you should expect that thing tohappen to you about once every 35 days David J Hand took this even further with seven billion people on Earth the chance that an event with aone in a million probability of happening to each of us wont happen today is1 in 10 to 3040 As Persi Diaconis put it the truly unusual day would be a daywhere nothing unusual happens And as always thanks for watching You may have noticed a lot of YouTubechannels making videos about learning this week Well that is not a coincidence It isschool of YouTube week Many people are going backto school or college right now but across the world millions of children wont be either because they work tosupport their families or live without a home Or in areaswhere there is conflict They may experience overcrowding at school or a lack of teaching and school supplies But luckily we can help Donations to Comic Reliefs School ofYouTube campaign can help disadvantaged young people allaround the world get an education It doesnt take

What Is The Earth Worth?,2014-08-28T11:57:28Z,13.283333333333333,14253837,260316,Hey Vsauce Michael here Earth only contains 1066 people Earth Texas The only place on Earth officially named Earth There are at least two places namedMoon but the Earth only has one astronomicalMoon Or does it From September 2006 to June2007 Earth had an additional Moon named 2006 RH120 Its a near Earth asteroid that usually orbits aroundthe Sun but for 13 months it fell into an orbit around our planetand became another Moon of Earth We can call it thatbecause technically a Moon is just a natural satellite Something in orbit around a planet that humansdidnt put there Theres no official minimum sizerequirement for Moon status The Moon its a Moon Sputnik space junk the InternationalSpace Station  not Moons they are artificial satellites Astronomers believe that most of thetime Earth has additional Moons Thesenewcomers dont always stick around that long and they tend to only be about a meter in diameter so we dont always detect them and they could less sensationally be called temporary asteroid moons But the vagueness of the word Moon means that yes technically Earth usually has more than one and Earth is booking it I mean weremoving through space incredibly quickly A light year is analmost unfathomable distance to put in the humanterms but our solar system orbits around thecenter of the Milky Way at about 782000 kilometres an hour Which means that from the perspective of the center of our galaxy about every 1300 years Earth travels an entire light year In other words the Great Pyramid of Giza wasnt just built 4500years ago it was also built almost threeandahalf light years away Big deal  whats it all worth Could we assign a price to the entireplanet To Earth itself Well Greg Loughman an astrophysicist atthe University of California Santa Cruz devised a beautiful equation for assessing the value of exoplanets we discover It considers their habitability their ease of being studied and of course how much money weve already spent looking for them Funny enough you can solve for Earth and find out that compared towhat weve already spent looking for exoplanets  and what we know about them  Earth is worth about five quadrillion dollars The History Channel famously stuck toEarth and rang up all of Earths resources likewater lumber and granite using the current market prices they arrived at a total of seven quadrillion dollars If youremoved and isolated all of the elements your bodycontains and then solved them each at market price you could fetch about two thousand dollars Reddit user Shady Potato applied this map to Earth If we could mine the entireplanet and separate out all of its pure elements and prices didnt changebecause of that we could sell it all for 158 sextillion dollars Of course calculations likethese dont include every single possible thing earth or any other planet has to offer and they also dont consider supply and demand If someone here on Earth or some extraterrestrial group of planet shoppers had quadrillions sextillions of dollars or theequivalent amount of power well they would have the option to shopin a much larger store For crying out loud thereare more than 10000 asteroids right here near Earth And just one of them  433 Eros   is estimated to contain a halfquintillion dollars worth of platinum alone and by weight even more iron So to be more realistic instead ofcalculating Earths value on Earth lets calculate its value on the galactic marketplace or the universal marketplace If you or somehypothetical group of aliens shopping for a planet could pick any planet in the entire Milky Way galaxy what aboutEarth would make it worth anything The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to contain a supply of around 100 to 400 billion planets As far as Earth analogues go Kepler space missiondata suggests there were probably 40 billion Earth size planets orbitingwithin habitable zones of stars in our galaxy And within theobservable universe Quadrillions So from a raw materials and habitabilitystand point Earth probably isnt that rare But Earth does have some unique selling points For one its probably the only planet like itselfwithin at least 12 light years So its location might be prime real estate for an intergalactic rest stop or imminent domain And secondly statisticallyspeaking life as we know it might not be unique to Earth but there probably isnt lifeelsewhere that formed exactly like it did here with jaguars palm trees and hairlessbipeds who made the same buildings andjokes and art and music that we have These might be the truestunique selling points for Earth Aliens wouldnt have to understand orappreciate any of it if it merely amused them it mightbe worth purchasing as a sort of museum or zoo at the least Of course interstellar planet shopperswouldnt have Earth currency to buy it with and space cash isnt worth anything here But the technology it would take for them to get to us would likely be at least thousands ofyears ahead of what we currently have So an equitable trade might be say limited use of Earth in exchange for their knowledge Or full use  or abuse  of Earth in exchange fortheir knowledge and fair relocation of all earthlings to some equally habitable exoplanet Boy this type of speculation is totally scifi But you know whats not The next part of establishing Earths value demand Despite what Earth has to offer despite what makes it unique and despiteNational Geographics list of ten reasons other life forms might want Earth so far we have received 0 offers The Fermi Paradox formally phrases this puzzle With so manyfriendly to life as we know it planets out there many of which havebeen around longer than even Earth why havent we been visited by or heard from intelligent life yet Maybe Earth and its intelligent life really are rare and special Or maybe Earth is so typical so unremarkable no otherintelligent advanced lifeforms could be bothered to stop by But thisraises another question Even if something came by what makes usthink it would make an offer Why would it consider our wishes at all In Star Trek 4 the aliens wanted totalk to whales and humans were just an awkward third wheel When Thomas Jefferson made the LouisianaPurchase he didnt ask say squirrels in Nebraska forpermission He just did it And all those squirrels weresuddenly in America without knowing it For all we know that may have already happened to us Earthcould be owned by some larger interstellar landlord Furthermore this entire question rests on aneven more fundamental assumption the assumption that otherintelligent life forms share our concept of ownership and the belief that physical things canbe bought and sold Amongst earthlings human bartering is pretty unique Only we have developed complicated socially agreedupon normsfor the barter of goods the use of currency for goods orthe concept that you can own a piece of Earths surface Sure animals can be territorial but theyhavent developed that into a more rigorous expansive sense of fair exchange And when it comes to an individual owning morethings than they could possibly hold or defend on their own well we humanshave systems for that We can teach some animals to use tokensas currency to exchange for treats but left on their own they dontincorporate economic ideas into their regular social lives At the most we observe animals bartering amongst each other for services   but not goods Why Well they may lackthe cognitive ability required to keep track of longterm transactional historiesBut they also lack two other extremely important thingscommunication and enforcement Services like grooming are difficult to steal soanimals can easily trade them But without a language to facilitate snitching nonhumans cant easily report thefts or devise systems for reporting and punishing violations Animals create some pretty beautiful things Bowerbird nests Pufferfish circles termite mounds or the dramatic costumesdecorator crabs fashion out of sea floor debris But ownership and the right to buy orsell what you make is only as useful as the power you have to enforce it And if you dont have enough powersomeone or something else will make decisions for you For instance we have decided that animals dont own the selfies they take Three years ago in Indonesia a monkey stole photojournalist David Slaters camera He later retreived the camera and found that the monkey had snapped these fantastic images Slater maintained that he should receiveroyalties from people who reproduce the images like Wikimedia but US federal regulatorsrecently ruled that since a nonhuman animal created these photos theyre officially in the public domain Theybelong to all of us The same goes for selfies taken by elephants or lambs or Asian shortclawed otters named Musa And its not just selfies at play herethe same goes for paintings made by chimpanzees or dog artists So maybe Earth is worth quadrillions or sextillions of dollars Maybe its worth renting in exchange for technological knowhow But the mere fact that we can conceive of ourselves selling our own planet is prettyincredible I mean we dont have a deed to planetEarth we really only own it via finders keepers But we didnt stumble upon Earth like a hermit crab in its shell we really just emerged from it We didntbuild Earth if anything its selective pressuresbuilt us Does that mean Earth is sort of like a womb Does that mean us selling Earth would bethe same as a child selling his or her parents Well not really Because we arent here for the purpose of leaving analogous to being born Honestly the most fitting metaphormight be not that we are Earths owners orchildren or one in the same with it but ratherthat we are Earths first willful effluvia In the context of the human body effluvia are little emissions of things builtup within They often make us giggle and can be gross And isnt thatwhat we are A sometimes messy stinky presence thathas built up within and will one day inevitably andto the extent already have discharged out into space I guess what Im saying is that puttinga price tag on Earth is all speculation We dontknow if we will never be Earths sales person But what we do know is that we are Earths first fart And as always thanks for

Dord.,2014-08-13T00:21:32Z,12.95,10380388,264304,Hey Vsauce Michael here In 1934 Websters dictionary gave birth to a new word by mistake Their chemistry editor Austin N Paterson submitted a simple entry D  or D abbreviation for density Nothing wrong with that but the entry was misread and dord was added to the dictionary Dord was an accidental word forthirteen years before the mistake was discovered and its wordship revoked Lets have funwith words today but first whats the deal with first Or for that matter second If you were inposition three youre in third place Position 5 fifth Position 197 one hundred and ninetyseventh Pretty simple So why do positions 1 and 2 give us first and second Shouldnt they be oneth and twoth Well maybe But English loves collateral adjectives Adjectives derivedfrom different roots than the nouns they describe There are plenty ofderived adjectives dont get me wrong A bunch of clouds make the day cloudy friends are friendly poets are poetic Things with a lot ofsmell to them are smelly but the Moon is not Moonly The Moon is lunar Collateral adjectives are everywhere Mouth stuff is oral Bees are apian Some nouns have both Fathers can be fatherly or paternal  And a setting filled with fog can be foggy or brumous Its often said that no word rhymes with orange Is that true Well rhyming can be controversial becauseit often depends on pronunciation accent and can be forced Especially ifyou use multiple words you can force orange to rhyme withdoor hinge if you want But what we want is a perfect rhyme A perfect rhyme is what occurs betweentwo words like tickle and pickle They are perfectrhymes because the final stressed vowel sound and all the soundsafterwards are identical Identical doesnt rhyme with picklebecause even though they both end with ickle identical has it stressin the wrong place We could rhyme them if we pronounced itnot identical but instead identical With that in mind orange does have perfect rhymes Theyjust happen to be extremely obscure like Blorenge a hill in Wales Silver also has a perfect rhyme chilver a female lamb Think Fact delineated even more words weoften say dont have rhymes but actually do Point is orange does have perfect rhymes and even if it didnt well that wouldnt make it special Sure monosyllabic words tend to rhyme with other words Its believedthere are only about 100 single syllable words that have no rhyme For instance wolf sixth depth and filmed But considering words of all lengths its been calculated that most English words dont rhyme with anything Dont believe me Well leave a comment below The wordcomment rhymes with nothing nor does husband sandwich liquid penguin chimney empty and of course nothing rhymes with nothing Identical rhymes are even more perfect than perfect rhymes but they become soidentical at that point its a little obvious and not reallyappreciated Identical rhymes occur when the consonantsound before the final stressed vowel between two words are also identical Sun and gun are perfect rhymes But gun and begun are identical rhymes So are offend and defend or homonyms like son and sun You could call the peoplewho watch over and monitor the police the police police Who watches over them Well the police police police of course You canstring together any number of polices and always createa sensible though clunky title You can even use the word police by itself to create agrammatical sentence It takes eight of them Police police police police police police police police Heres what the sentencemeans Police police which police police police watch overpolice police Add any multiple of three more police tothis stream and you preserve the grammar The mostthat fit on Twitter is 20 If you say police enough timesit starts to sound like its not even a real word That is called jamais vu the reverse of deja vu when something familiar all of a suddenfeels new and novel Ive covered it before butlets be clear If you dont practice obediency to the police you may wind up in J L Escape and youre an SKP Letters whose names said together somesimilar to words are called Gramograms You cant hear a pterodactyl urinate because itssilent p But every letter in the alphabet issilent sometimes And some letters are used morefrequently than other letters in English words Scrabble provides moreof those letters and people guess them more often when playing hangman Next time you play hangman you can take advantage of this People will guess more lettersincorrectly if you choose a short word that has few different letters John McLuhan ran 15 million computer simulations ofhangman and he found that the most difficult word forpeople to guess is jazz Phantonyms arent ghostly undead words theyre wordsthat appear to mean one thing but actually mean something completely different Enervate sounds like it means to fill with energy but it actually means to drain of energy to weaken Noisome appears to mean really noisy but it actually describes something that has an extremely offensive smell In 2005 the New Oxford American Dictionarypublished a new word esquivalience They said it meant the wilful avoidance ofones official responsibilities But it didnt They made it up as a copyright trap If anyone copiedtheir dictionary the stealer wouldnt be able to explainhow esquivalience wound up in their dictionary without admitting that they had copied it Map makers often insert fake features for the same purposes Streets andtowns that only exist to trap copiers that only exist on paper Paper Streets  Paper Towns The author ofThe Trivia encyclopedia even placed a fake fact in one of his books because hewas certain that the Trivial Pursuit board game wastaking their questions from his book Sure enough later theboard game included his fake fact as a real question Similarly the esquivalinece trap was used to catch Dictionarycom But heres the thing authorities donttend to respect copyright traps built out of fake facts Facts cannot be copyrighted They belong to and can be used by all of us US federal courts have argued that fake facts presented as real are notprotected because if they were no one could share real true informationwithout fear of sharing something protected by copyright That said stylistic decisions like how the factsare selected or arranged or articulated can be copyrighted When the automobileassociation was caught mimicking the stylistic features of ordnancesurveys they were forced to pay up twenty million pounds You cannot own a fact and you cannot own a lie you made up ifeveryone believes it But you can own how you tell them Puns are great and in The Pun Also Rises John Pollock relates a fantastic storyPuns can be traced all the way back to be epic of Gilgameshwhere people are warned of an upcoming giant flood They aretold that the skies will soon rain kibtu and kukku Words that mean corn and the sound corn makes whenfalling on the ground But in the story the words are actuallypuns on words for misery and suffering People who got the pun prepared andsaved their own lives but those who failed to recognise the punperished in the flood which means the very oldest pun on record was literally corny Is that ironic No Irony is one of the most debated figures of speech The Oatmealcomfamously lamented that if anyone refers to anything as being ironic the hip thing to do right now isto call it out as being not ironic Situational irony is what wetend to mean when we say something is ironic The Oatmeal defines it as when somethinghappens and a reversal of expectations occurs Digcoms recent article on thesubject uses an even stricter definition saying situational irony is a directresult of an action intended to produce the opposite effect Their example is really good If the elevators at in elevator repair school are out of order thats not really situational ironyInstead what would be really ironic is that if theelevators were out of order because the experts at the school had done something to them they believed would make them run foreverand never be out of order Alanis Morissette wrote asong called Ironic whose lyrics contain situations but famously no situational irony People love pointing this out A traffic jam when youre already lateNot situational irony thats just a bummer or a sadcoincidence Patrick Cassels cleverly rewrote the songs lyrics to containsituations that are actually situationally ironic For example a traffic jam when youre already late to receive anaward from the municipal planning board for reducing the citys automobilecongestion eighty percent or a black fly in yourchardonnay poured to celebrate the successful fumigation of your recently purchased vineyard in southern France Now thats what I call situational irony But regardless of what Alanis intended a close reading of the songs lyricsreveals that irony is occurring just not the situationalkind its hip to argue about Instead her song is all about dramatic irony When someone is often hilariously unaware of the significance of an eventwhile other people are Take a look at the lyrics for IronicThe situations she describes are never explicitly labeled ironic At the most theyre simplystories and similes and metaphors for it life And she adds later life is also ironic Dramatically ironic Thesethings sound like cruddy scenarios but they actually figure they actually make sense Ironic is not a list of examples ofsituational irony Instead its a treatise on dramatic irony the difference between what life knows we need and what we think we need Whats ironic isnt 10000 spoons whenall you need is at knife Its the fact that as Alanis believes you have all ofthose spoons because unbeknownst to you but known by life what you really need right now is only spoons Or the last thing youneed right now is a knife On the subject of overanalysing pop songs analysis of dog mitochondrial DNAhas revealed that all dogs may be traceable to a localised event The species is believed to have resultedfrom the domestication of wolves about 11000 to 16000 years ago in what is now Southwestern China So Baha Men to answer your question it was the Mesolithic Southwestern Chinese who let the dogs out And as always thanks for watching,131.5057915057915,automobileassociation,0.0,1.0,nb0YoRMXIY0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb0YoRMXIY0
What Is The Speed of Dark?,2014-07-29T21:21:02Z,13.533333333333333,23626963,580226,Hey Vsauce Michael here Nyctophobia is the fear of the dark But theres another fear thats more chilling Its the fear that darkness will go away Optophobia the fear of opening your eyes Light travels at the fastest speed possible fora physical object Darkness is erased when light appears and returns when light leaves The speed of dark is the speed of light but there areother types of darkness that can move faster than light speed Forinstance a shadow Across a distance a shadow can becomemuch larger than the object creating it but still mimic its source moving in thesame way for the same amount of time So when a shadow is bigger than the object casting it it moves a greater distance when the object moves but in the same amount of time Make a shadow large enough and it can travel across the surface faster than light If you here on Earth cast a shadow ontothe Moon not an easy thing to do that pointedfrom say point A on the moons surface and then you movedyour finger so that the shadow moved to point B your finger would only move afew centimetres in a fraction of a second But theshadow it cast on the Moon would move thousands of kilometers inthe same amount of time Do it right and youre easily producing a shadow that breaks the light barrier But nothings wrong here The rule is that information canttravel faster than light You cant cause something to happensomewhere else faster than light could travel from youto that somewhere else And our superluminal shadow is transferring no information from point A to point B Sure point B is being cast intodarkness sooner than a light speed message from A could warn him its coming but darkness isnt traveling frompoint A to point B Its traveling from you to point A and point B at the speed of light What we tend to call a shadow is really just a crosssection of a threedimensional region The darkness you are causing only changes shape when newly unblocked light fills the previous gap Thats all shadow is a gap So in a way a shadow doesnt travel at all Thats an illusion caused by us thinking that a shadow is a physical thing when in reality a shadow is just the lack of physical things  photons  which chug along at speed limit of the universe But that doesnt mean two shadows cant kiss Or at least look like they are Watch as Guy brings two shadows near each other Right before they actually make contact the shadows seem to magically bulge toward one another in a sort of smooch of darkness Whats going on is the shadows blister effect and it has to do withthe anatomy of a shadow The region where an object completely blocks a light source is called the umbra Its the darkest part of theshadow in the most prototypical part of the shadow Where only a portion of the light source is blocked we find the fainter penumbra But as two or more penumbras approach and overlap the combined amount of light they block can be enough to produce a perceivable difference the shadow blister The Earth has a big umbra its 14 million kilometres long Thats how far away youd have to be fromthe Earth for it to no longer have a large enough apparent diameter to block out all of the sun Here on thesurface of Earth we are nowhere near that far away which is why night is so umbral Night is just the Earths shadow falling on you A you eclipse Sunsets are cool theyre beautiful to look at but lookthe other way and you can see the lumbering shadow of our planet Our atmosphere scatters shorterwavelengths of light more than longer wavelengths which makes the sky appear blue But in Earths shadow theresless light to scatter and the sky appears darker During twilight you can see the demarcation While driving east fromDenver to Kansas City I got a particularly great view of it This is Earths approaching nightmaking shadow The beautiful pink band above it Thats the belt of Venus Its caused by the sky reflecting the the colours of the sunset behind us Youve probably noticed that right after the sun sets and disappears from view theres still light in the sky scattered from the no longer visible sun This is what we call twilight and there are many different stages oftwilight If the sun is less than six degreesbelow the horizon its technically civil twilight You can still do plenty of stuff outdoors without the need for artificial lights Down to 12 degrees below the horizon we have nautical twilight artificial lights aremore or less necessary but the sky still scatters enough light to be bright enough for ships at sea to navigate by seeing a contrast of the horizon between dark sea and faintly lit sky Down to 18 degrees an astronomical twilight is occurring It looks like night but the sky can still get darker Until astronomical twilight ends not all night time astronomical observations can be made Below 18 degrees is technically honestly night If you live at greater than485 degrees north or south latitude during the summer the sun never goes more than 18 degrees below the horizon Its never technically night Places likeLondon only reach astronomical twilight at the most during these monthsSo if you live in one of these areas and you want to avoid doing something duringthe summer just tell people youll do it tonight Youll buy yourselfa few weeks But thats slow darkness Lets cut to the chase because we are lookingfor fast darkness When scissor blades snip the intersectionpoint between both blades moves faster than the blades themselvesThink of it this way if you had a pair of scissors withblades that were a light year long and it took one second to close them theintersection point wouldve traveled an entire light year in not a year but a second No laws are being broken herebecause such a snip would be physically impossible As Ive mentioned before rigid objects dont move instantaneously all over when a push force is applied to them Instead that force moves via electromagneticforces from one atom to the next and so on down the lineA compression wave that travels at the speed of soundthrough the material But what if we ignored that problem byallowing the blades to simply be separately already in motion Well their point atintersection can still travel faster than lightbecause its not a physical thing Its just a geometric point and it carries no more information than you could already gather by witnessing the approaching blades But dont count out that geometric point ofintersection just yet Its the key to another type of darkness that can move faster than light When waves collide their crests can fuse into larger crests their troughs into larger troughs This isconstructive interference But crests colliding with troughs cancelout Destructive interference if these wavesare light the result is darkness And in certaincircumstances darkness created this way can travel like the intersection between two lines  faster than light Imagine these concentriccircles as waves of light The lines are wave crests and thegaps in between are troughs When they meet the pointswhere they intersect flee up and down faster than the wavestravel especially in the middle which in thecase of light waves makes them faster than light The superluminalspeeds of these dark patches can be seen really clearly if we make the wave crests of one source black as well as the background Overlappingregions where red peeks through represent destructiveinterference  darkness And you can see how especiallyin the middle this darkness races up and down fasterthan the waves In 1995 a man named McArthur Wheeler robbed a bank in Pittsburgh He was caught because his only disguise was lemon juice He covered his face with it He knew that lemon juice could be used as an invisible ink when writing on paper revealed by heating and he knew so little about why that worked and he knew so little about how cameras worked that he assumed with extreme confidence that lemon juice could make him invisible too Seriously Wheeler is an extreme example and was the inspiration for the DunningKruger effect Novices people unskilled in particular disciplines will often overestimate their knowledge and abilities in said disciplines because they dont even know how little they know how much more there is to learn On the flip side experts in particular field will often underestimate their knowledge have lessconfidence in their abilities or think that everyone else has thesame level of knowledge that they do What drives the DunningKruger effect is the fact that often the more youlearn about something the more you realise just how rich and complex and overwhelming and full of as of yet unanswered questions it really is George Bernard Shaw once famously toasted Albert Einstein by saying Science is always wrong It never solves a problem without creating ten more Einstein didnt exactly disagree He used geometry to illustrate how ignorance growsfaster than knowledge saying as our circle of knowledge expands so doesthe circumference of darkness surrounding it Learning studying shedding light on a field ofinquiry also reveals just how in the dark we continue to be How manyshadowy things there are left for us to illuminate The diameter oflight never exceeds the shadowy circumference But whats the speed of that kind darkThe speed of the growth of the number of things we know we are in the dark about Whats the speed of ignorance If we define ignorance as the differencebetween questions we know to ask and answers we have the field of agnotology the study of ignorance suggests that the amount of things we know we are in the dark about is growing faster than the amount the things we have shed light on Is it a coincidence that the phrase inthe dark originated during of all ages the age of enlightenment When Leeuwenhoek put a scraping from his tooth under a collection ofmagnifying lenses he built he saw for the first time in human history little moving creatures microorganisms He called them Animalcules The discovery shed light on why food spoiled life didnt spontaneously comefrom old meat it was already there we just couldnt see it But the discovery also showed us that wewere in the dark about an entirely new realm of biology As Philippe Bourdeau has poetically put itenlightenment leads to benightedness science entails nescience Whats really cool aboutthe expanding size of our nescience circumference is what Stuart Firestein the Chair of Biological Sciences at Columbia University has said about it it is there that science begins where the facts run out just beyond them He says it is a mistake to bob aroundin the circle of facts instead of riding the wave to thegreat expanse lying outside the circle If science is a road trip facts are the photos we take along the way the fuel that drives it forward is ignorance Facts more like fax Part of the past not the way forward When it comes to understanding our world knowing why is obsolesce by asking why Knowing facts makes you bright but the equally quick sometimes quicker and most rewarding prize is the dark And admitting that you dont know everything but that you would like to know some of it And as always thanks for watching,141.94581280788177,destructiveinterference,0.0,-1.0,JTvcpdfGUtQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTvcpdfGUtQ
What is Random?,2014-07-16T16:33:59Z,11.2,11097411,310633,Hey Vsauce Michael here and Derek Generate 78 Thats so random Or is it What does it mean to be random Can anything really be random Whats the most random thing ever Today lets stop being random and become ransmart If something is unpredictable and contains no recognisable patterns wecall it random So lets begin our hunt for the most random thing with a coin toss The Australian 50 cent coin is one of the largest coins currently in circulation Coin flips and rolling dice are notintrinsically random they are only random because of our ignorance If we could know every initial condition the exact forces and properties that playfor a particular flip or roll we could theoretically calculate the result before it even happened And sure enough researchershave built coin flipping robots that can precisely control a flip to getthe result they want 100 percent of the time So here is our question Is there anything you couldnt predict even if you knew everything A process determined by nothing And how can you be sure theyre arent any patterns in what yourelooking at Maybe you just havent looked for the right pattern yet Or maybe you have already seen truerandomness but didnt know it because you didntlook for long enough As if protected by a sort of camouflage a random process can and willoccasionally produce patterns YouTube URLs are pretty much random A unique one is made for everyuploaded video but sometimes like the proverbial monkeys typing awayon typewriters YouTube generates a URL that contains by chance a word The official music video for 50 Cents In Da Club contains a synonym for bottom This video was assigned hello there are some sexies and a sauce If youwant to find out if a particular word has been randomly assigned to a videoyet you can search for it by using this string in Google The point is randomness is difficult to identifyIt is easier to be certain that something is not random than that it is But despite this elusiveness something interesting is going on right now Increasingly we especially young people are callingclearly predictable things random Like randomly running into your best friend at a popular restaurant Or hilariously bizarre combinations of things that we call totally random because they areseemingly unrelated even though of course they were chosennot in random but in a very determined way because they are all unrelated Those guys that showed up at the party last night you didnt know they werent randos in a mathematical sense They knew about the party were inthe mood to go to a party and were in the area Pretty predictable actually This nonstatistical use of the word random annoys some people but its not that far offfrom the original meaning of the word In the 1300s random meant running or at great speed Later it would be used to describethings that have no definite purpose It wasnt until the 1800s that randomtook on a particular mathematical definition Then in the 1970s MITs student paper popularised the use of the word randomto simply mean strange Of course just becausesomething is strange doesnt mean it has no discoverable cause Why have we startedcalling so many predictable things random Well many theories revolve around the amount up information and new peoplewe are confronted with at an increasing rate now more than everbefore Perhaps its just easier almost a bit of a relief to call things random so that we can move on to synthesise other information Take a look at this die Now as you can see it rolls a five most of the time but not all the time Over time a sequence of its results will containless randomness But it is still random Any face ispossible and I have no guarantee beforehand of knowing which face will show up Theoutcomes Im selecting from make the resulting sequence less full of randomness but the process is still random Even though a die and a coin areextremely sensitive to their initial conditions and over the course of normal use arequite unpredictable they do over time exhibit certain biases Biases that make them a bit more predictable and a little less random than you might think First of all dice Evenprecision dice are only quality controlled within a few micrometers You can check this out yourself Make two stacks of ten or more similar dice Now if you orient each die every which wayyou should pretty much get two equally sized stacks But if you arrange each stack along a shared axis so that every diefaces the same way any regular imperfections caused by themanufacturing process may become visible But what about coins Well some fantastic research has beendone on what happens when they spin and flip For instance it has been found that USnickel is just the right diameter and thickness to wind up landing not heads up or tails up when flippedbut on its side about once every six thousandtimes its flipped But what about the fairness of flippinga coin Well if you flip a coin like this for statistical and physical reasonsthe side facing up before the flip begins doesnt actually havea fifty percent chance of being the result Instead as researchers at Stanford havefound it actually has a fifty one percent chance In this case it was the other side though Still pretty random If you want a coin flip to be as fair as possible you should just catch it in your hand Dontallow it to hit the ground bounce tumble and spin Thats because researchers havefound that when a coin spins larger biases come into play The shape of its edge its centre of gravity The heavier side tends to go down quite often In the case of some coins as often as eighty percent of the time Its beenfound that a one euro coin will spin and land heads up more often than not and a US penny will land tails up more often than not when spun But like I said earlier theoretically if we kneweverything about the initial conditions of a coin flip or a die roll we could calculate beforehand their outcome Why dont we do that more often Well its extremely difficult Insane amounts of precision would be required because the smallest difference between two initialconditions can be magnified over time leading to chaotic extremely difficultto predict results Randomorg the service Derek and I used at the beginning of this video to generate arandom number uses atmospheric noise Its extremely hard to predict but technically still a deterministic system All that noise came from somewhere andif we could just find out those initial conditions we could theoretically predict their outcomes If we want a system more random than that we will need to find one thatis determined by nothing and for that lets look closer Quantumly close Quantum mechanics may have our answer It describes the properties of quantumlysized things as probabilities just chances Not because we dont know enoughyet to be certain or predict but because well the idea is theres nothing there to predict There is no beforehand we could know Whether or not a particular individualradioactive atom will decay or not or whatever the spin of an electron is is only knowable once we look Theyredetermined by a deepseated randomness woven into the universe itself Einstein couldnt believe thisHe refused to accept as he said that God played dice with the universe But experiments with entangled particles have shown violations of Bell inequalities Entangled particles are particles thatexhibit similar properties even when separated by large distances Now if they agreed on those sharedproperties to have or are somehow determined beforehand to have them their behaviors should satisfy Bells famous inequalitiesBut experiments have found that instead the likelihood of what amachine will see when measuring one particle determines how the other machine willmeasure the other particle It is here when we look that the chance isdetermined Explanations for this are even weirder but what the resultssuggest is that the chance of seeing particular quantum qualities dont preexist They happen when you look So if you are ever feeling boring or predictable just remember that you aremade out of octillions of quantum probabilities Dice that donttumble in any analysable way we could ever predict They are the most random thing God may play dice with the universe but they are the best dice in the universe And as always thanks for watching But what does it all mean Well true randomness doesnt mean anythingI mean for us to have meaning we need structure predictability and that is what Imexploring over on my channel Veritasium Wow okay So lets go over there and take a look at what is not random Veritasium lets go Ill see you guys over there Its going to be awesome come with us And as always thanks for

What If The Earth Stopped Spinning?,2014-06-16T15:34:01Z,9.733333333333333,21156532,412671,Hey Vsauce Michael here The Earth is spinning and we are spinning along withit But what if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning Well first of all you would gain weight But that would be the least of your worries The spin of our planet is important and literally giving you the time of your life At the equator the surface of Earth and everything on it is spinning around at465 meters per second As you move closer to the poles youdont have to move as quickly to complete Earths daily rotation Here in San Francisco the Earth is driving me east at 368 meters per second If I could float above the surface independent of the Earths rotation theEarth would spin underneath me this quickly Pretty cool But of coursewhen I jump straight up into the air the Earth doesnt move underneath mebecause I continued to spin with it We are all spinning with the Earth andthat is why slamming on a set of magical planetary breaks that causedeverything classically called earth to stopspinning would be catastrophic Immediately everything that wasnt Earth and wasnt safely at the poleswould continue moving as it had been and be flung due east at more than athousand miles an hour You wouldnt be flung into space becauseescape velocity is 24800 mph but your body would instantly become a 95 inch caliber bullet Well really more of a supersonic tumbleweed Because the atmosphere would moregradually slow down people in airplanes assuming they could navigate theresulting storms might have a better chance of surviving Astronauts aboard the ISS would fare even better But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for them down on the ground Runways would just be entrances to the new planetsized graveyard created by the no longer spinning Earth People really really near the polesmight be okay but only at first Gusts of wind as fast asthose near an atomic bomb detonation would blast pass the surface and up into thesky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude The friction alone caused by the now stopped Earth collidingwith these winds would be enough to cause massive fires unparalleled erosion and damage toanything strong enough to stay put after the initial braking The Sun wouldseem to freeze in the sky as days became not 24 hours long but 365 days long Without spinning innards Earthsprotective magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadlyamounts of ionising radiation from the Sun The oceans would surge onto land intsunamis kilometers high and wash over nearly all dry land before migrating to the poles where gravity is stronger no longer held tothe ocean basins by the inertia Earths spin gave them until Earth itself no longer bulging an extra 42kilometers around its equator because of its rotation slowly compressed into a more perfect sphere than it is now Possibly allowing theoceans to eventually return somewhat That is what would occur if it actually happenedIt wont actually happen but woah its rotation is slowing down More on that later First if the Earthreally is spinning so quickly why cant we feel it Why doesnt the Earths rotation make us dizzy Well lucky for us the change in velocity is just toogradual The Earth is too huge Its like driving in a car that takes 6 hours and six thousand miles to makeone left turn Its not sudden enough toregister with our senses But that change in velocity is real and it makes us way less because of inertia On our spinningplanet your velocity is constantly changing but always tangential to the circular path you werebeing dragged along Now because inertia is a property ofmatter which includes your body without a force acting upon us we would slowly leave the surface of Earth Luckily the Earth is exerting a force on usA centerseeking centripetal force delivered by gravity The centripetal force required to keepyou along a circular path with Earth is subtracted from Earths total gravitational pull on you The remaining force simply pushes you down toward the centre of the Earth  it gives you weight At the equator if the Earth didnt spinand no centripetal force was required to keep you with the Earth you would weigh 03 percent more than you currently do If Earth spun you around 17 times faster than it currently doesall of its gravitational force would go toward centripetal forcefighting against your inertia and you would be weightless So heres a diet idea Hope that the Earth starts spinning faster and go back for guiltfree seconds Seconds We know exactly how long a second is The outermost electron of an atom of cesium 133 is alone When the atom is undisturbed only the nucleus interacts with this outermost electron tickling it regularly and rapidly between two levels After 9192631770 oscillations between those two levelsone second has passed Exactly That is literally the definition of a second We can measure and count those oscillations Its how atomic clocks work Making atomic clocks the most accurate measurement deviceever built by humans to measure anything We cant define a second more simply as say 160th of 160th of 124th of a day because of Earths spin Its too irregular Little changes in the distribution of mass on Earthcaused by earthquakes or melting ice or manmade dams or technically even you walking up stairs or downstairs cause Earths rotational speed to change Like a figure skater moving their armsfurther away from or closer to their bodies Now add on top of that the fact that tides caused by the Moon drag against Earths rotation and youwind up with an unstable rotation speed that is predominately slowing down Now these changes are incredibly incrediblyslight but over time they add up In 140 million years a day on earth will not be 24 hours long it will be 25 That might not sound like much but in order to do important things likedeliver accurate GPS information we need a more accurate timekeeping device than that So as a solution scientists keep the pace of secondsusing atomic clocks TAI time And other scientists measure the changing speed of Earthsrotation by observing distant stars and quasars Now every few months theyfind out just how behind or ahead Earth is running and if its getting tooclose to being a second off they decide to add or subtract thesecond from the current year The result is the time used almost everywhere including your phone UTC Since this system began in 1972 25 leap seconds have been added What this means is that clock time is and has to be a manufactured product with upgrades and tune ups administered periodically after defects are noticed The time we give to now and the future is only ever approximate Thats weird but its also entirely not weird As Demetrios Matsakis the ChiefScientist of Time Services for the US Naval Observatory puts it we save lives and we end lives We add time and wecan take time away but in both cases we do sowithout completely

Some Surprising Things,2014-06-02T02:21:36Z,9.116666666666667,8187172,217452,Hey Vsauce Michael here Whats normal Are you normal Well today lets bathe our brains with those questions and scrub down with things that are surprising and counterintuitive What does it mean to be normal in the first placeWell maybe it just means to be average But an average can be a bit weird a bit misleading For instance think of this way The average human has one breast and one testicle Also theaverage person has not climbed to the top of Gangkhar Puensum In fact no one has Gangkhar Puensum is considered the tallest mountain on Earth that has yet to be summited And its unlikely it ever will be soon It lies on the border of China and Bhutanand local governments believe the area to be holy and no mountaineering or climbing is allowed But dont worry there are plentymore There are at least a hundred other recognised peaks that are quite tall and remain unsummitted Thats great Its surprising to think that Earth hasso many places that still have yet to be conquered or explored At least we were allborn here on Earth Derek from the YouTube channel Veritasium where were you born A small Australian town called Traralgon But were you really born there Im suspicious of Dereks answer because saying that you were born on Earths surface is like saying you were born in a taxicab The taxicab may still be around but isit in the exact same location that it was at the moment of your birth Probably notLike a taxicab the Earth is moving and its moving quickly For one the Earth is spinning This is real timefootage of Earth spinning you dont notice much movement at all but thats just because Earth is so large To a distant observer beyond Earth two seconds from now you will be an entire kilometre eastfrom where you are now Earth is also orbiting around the Sun quickly Three days ago I was in Singapore Fromthe reference frame of Earths surface Singapore is 6000 kilometresaway from this place Sydney Australia But in terms of Earthorbiting around the Sun three days ago I wasnt just 6000 kilometres away I was more than 7 million The point is where you were born when you were born is now just an empty region of space Earth will never ever return to My favourite surprise isthe solution to the Three Prisoners problem Its related to the Monty Hallproblem but the stakes are higher Its solution is notoriouslycounterintuitive Lets say that myself Kevin and Jake have been arrested And we are told that tomorrow morning two of us will be executed We dont know which two so its a terrible night But if I ask a guard to tell mesomething about what happens tomorrow and the guard says Michael I wont tellyou anything about your fate and I wont tell you who lives but I willtell you this little piece of information tomorrow morning Jake is one of the guys who will be executed What a relief I used to have a onein three chance of being the one who lives but now that I know Jake dies its justbetween Kevin and I My chances of living have gone up from 1 in 3 to 1 in 2 This is great Well if I thought that I would actually be wrong In fact my chances of livinghavent changed at all and Kevins are paradoxically now twiceas good as mine How can that be Well take a look at this This circle represents the three possibilities Either tomorrow Jake will live Kevin will live or I will live The hearts represent life Isnt that beautiful Now lets focus on what the guard can tell me In the case that Jake is the one who has beenselected to live both Kevin and myself will die tomorrow But the guard cannot tell me anythingabout myself and he cannot tell me who lives so if Jake is the one chosen tosurvive all the guard can tell me is that Kevin will be one of the guyswho dies tomorrow thats it Now in this case where Kevin is the guy selected to live both myselfand Jake will die tomorrow but the guard cant tell me about myself and cannot tell me who lives So all theguard can say is that tomorrow Jake is one of the guys who will dieHeres where it gets interesting If I am the one who has been picked tolive tomorrow the guard has a choice he can either tell me that Kevin is the one who will die tomorrow or hecan tell me that Jake is one of the guys who willdie tomorrow Well look at what weve got here If the guard tells me that Jake is one of the guys who will die tomorrow Im only faced now with these possibilities In onethird of these cases I am the survivor and in twothirds of these cases Kevin is the survivor My chances havent changed and Kevins are now twice as good as mine used to be It is a beautiful day here in SydneyBefore I arrived in Australia I was in Singapore where it was also beautiful but incredibly humid The air felt thick to move through and breathe but in actuality humid air is less dense than dry air Derek tell us about Avogadros Law Well Avogadro came up with the idea that in a given volume of gas at a giventemperature and pressure there will be always the same number of gas particlesDoesnt matter what the gas is if its helium or nitrogen or oxygen And that holds truth for air which is a mixture of gases Thats right So its got nitrogen and oxygen principally But if its humid air then you replacesome of those nitrogens and oxygens with water And water is wider than the diatomic nitrogen and oxygen thatexists in our atmosphere Thats rightOxygen and nitrogen have masses of 32 and 28 whereas water is just 18 Humid air is actually much less dense than dry air Its lighter and things can movethrough it more easily This is especially true when it comes to baseballs A baseball travels through humid air more easily and further with the same amount ofenergy If air becomes more humid and decreases drag by only fivepercent that can mean the difference between a fly ball and a home run This became a problem when indoor baseball stadiums started toplay around with the idea of turning on the air conditioning whenthe rival team came up to bat Essentially the air conditioning made the air dryer therefore thicker and made the rival team hit baseballs shorter distances The word normal by the way is homological What does that mean A homological adjective describes itself For instance the word tiny is pretty tiny Its a small word The word unhyphenated is unhyphenated Normal is one of the top 1000 most commonlyspoken and written words The word normal is normal it describes itself But theyre also words that are heterologicaladjectives that dont describe themselvesFor instance the word misspelled Yes well if you dont misspell it If you dont misspell it What about abbreviated Ooo I like that one too What about German Not a German word Thats a good oneHow about monosyllabic Thats heterological because it doesnt describe itselfBut polysyllabic For sure I especially love just how homological pentasyllabic is Yeah five syllables That is genius Well its the way words are The way they normally are But what about you are you normal Well a common way of defining normal is to say that something about you isnormal if you fall within just one standard deviation of the average for all people But there are a lot of things about you You can easily think of say 36 different independent variablesDifferent things to say about yourself For instance how tall you are how manyfriends you have how bad your breath is or say how often you lie Now the statisticalprobability that you would be normal for all 36 of those different attributes is actually one in a millionWhich means mathematically speaking it is quite abnormal to be normal And as always thanks for watching,150.49360146252283,notoriouslycounterintuitive,0.0,1.0,_Oc9tKkH7WE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oc9tKkH7WE
Why Don't We All Have Cancer?,2014-05-19T20:34:53Z,9.383333333333333,13207326,383605,Hey Vsauce Michael here Since this video began more than a million of your cells have died Its natural dont worry But you are literally covered with death Dead stuff Fingernails your hair the outermost layer of your skin  allmade out of dead things And you are losing this dead stuffconstantly Every week about 55 grams of dead skin sheds off of your body Ohio State University found that 80 of that material you see indoorsbeautifully dancing across sunbeams is dead human skin But for the most part you are made out of living stuff You are a biological furnace burning food energy to move and breathe and think and stay warm As you can see onGrandIllusionscom the heat from your own hand while you sit still is enough to run a Stirling engine Your cells are busy and active and dividing millions and millions of times every dayIn fact because of that you shouldnt even really be called a person You should be called a persON and on and on and on and on and on andon and on But heres the really mindblowing thing about the mind sustaining process of cell division the replication of instructionsDNA for each daughter cell requires copying an exact sequence of three billion nucleotides Thats a lot Luckily our bodies are perfectly happyto do it but theyre not perfect Every time a single cell in your bodydivides the enzymes that synthesize your DNA make 120000 mistakes Some of these mistakes wind up being beneficial Some of thesemistakes wind up being harmful and some are just neutral they dont make a differenceBut if a mistake a mutation in a cells DNA causes thecell to behave abnormally and stimulate its own growth ignore signals to stop stimulate the body to give it its ownblood supply potentially multiply forever and unstick fromwhere it began to spread throughout the body it becomes a special type of cell We have found 200 diseases with variousorigins and natures that fit this description Despite beingdifferent they often go by the same name cancer DNA mutations occur randomly in your body but they can also be inherited or causedby the environment For example exposure to ultravioletradiation from the Sun can cause all kinds of damageincluding genetic damage If little or no skin protection isused the accumulation of all these types of damage can be quite dramatic This man drove a truck for years exposing one side of his face to more sunlight than the other And for 15 years this woman worked in a room that had the same window A window to her left Environmental damage to the body whether cancercausing or not is serious business In fact giraffes have black tonguesbecause the dark pigmentation protects their tongues from solar radiation while theyre hanging out all day Go back far enough beyond where sunshinehits and their tongues are pink Given the sheer number of environmentaldangers to our DNA and the sheer number of mistakes our ownbodies make with our DNA every day it is incredible that we all arentdeveloping cancers constantly and immediately after being bornOne of the things we have to thank is our bodys own version of autocorrect Biological mechanisms like proofreadingand mismatch repair catch and correct or stop more than 99 of errors We grow old and pass away for many many reasonsBut when it comes to cancers our bodies own internal autocorrect is like the autocorrect on your phone Its pretty good but itsnot perfect Cancers still develop especially after theaccumulation of mistakes and mutations over time Im incredibly grateful toCancer Research UK They helped me a lot with thisepisode and thanks to work by groups like them we are at an accelerating rate findingways to prevent and control cancer beyond what our bodies can do aloneI mean after all natural selection can only see so much because of the selection shadow We arent all the same and if your geneticvariations make you and your children more successful at reproducing well what do you know yourcharacteristics become more common But this phenomenon has a weak influence here Later in life after your role inreproduction and raising offspring to independence has passed We have found evidence of the selection shadow at work with mice and bats Raised under perfect conditions withveterinary medicine and safe lives mice only live about two to three years Whereas bats with similar sizes andmetabolisms can live for thirty years or more The significantdifference here is that unlike mice bats have had in the wildfor millions of years fewer predators  a smaller chance of dying early due to extrinsic mortality Theyve onaverage had more days for natural selection to influence This could be a very goodexplanation for why diseases that affect our complex multicellular selves late in life are still with us But wait why are humans living so long today I mean in the past but genetically recently werent teenagers considered middle aged Not really Well its true that in thepast life expectancies were quite a bit lower a life expectancy is merely an average number of years a person wasexpected to live as soon as they were born And in the past infant mortality was so high the average was brought downsignificantly Its true that in the early 1600s here in England life expectancy was only 35 years But if you made the age of 21 Well you could easily expect to live well into your 60s Lifespans that go beyond the age of reproduction have always made sense for humansbecause we are intelligent and social useful to one another and our children take a lot of time and guidance to gain independence But that just moves the selection shadow ahead Its still there suggesting that in the end our bodies might just be tools our sex cells use to reproduce and grow up to do it again Nature andtime havent helped our bodies battle late acting diseases because a chicken is just an eggs way of making another egg But maybe not for long Our minds andmodern science technology engineering and mathematics are making progress against late acting diseasesAnd when it comes to cancers Cancer Research UK points out that 40 years ago only one in four people lived ten years or longer after being diagnosedToday that number is 2 in 4 And they believe that in only twenty yearsthat statistic could be as high as 3 in 4 Refrigeration and sanitation aretackling stomach cancers caused by infection vaccines are preventing cervical cancerantismoking campaigns and reductions of obesity and diabetes and the elimination of cancercausing chemicals from oureveryday lives are giving us an edge We learn more every single day The process is slow but steady Because cancer is not just one thing Its unlikely there will everbe a single cure for cancer because there are two hundred different types of cancers But there will be cures andbetter methods of prevention and detectionAdvances are coming from all over For example what we have learned aboutcontrolling proton beams because of the Large Hadron Collider has reduced the need for special shieldsduring the removal of eye tumours The statistical surprise that cancersarent more common in our bodies is a sign that were involved in a relay race Natural selection already did some of thework now its our turn When we talk about cancerwe often use the language of war its a battle its a fightBut the challenge isnt so much a war with winners andlosers and surrender as it is a mutinyWe cant help the fact that we are all at sea Natural selection at least gave us boats but now we are making where those boats go our decision And as always thanks for watching,137.05150976909414,significantdifference,0.0,-0.9,Qja4z1HGDQo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qja4z1HGDQo
The Web Is Not The Net,2014-05-08T13:37:03Z,10.916666666666666,7154994,197412,Hey Vsauce Michael here Mimas is one of Saturns cutest moons Its entire surface area is about thesame as Spain but its giant crater makes it look like the Death Star And when NASA made a temperature map of Mimas they found that the warmestregions shown here in yellow resemble PacMan eating the crater like a dot I learned about Mimas whilst surfing the world wide web like a true internaut But the Web and the Internet are different things The WorldWide Web and the Internet have names that aresimilar shapes but they catch different things And as we will see surfing the world wide web is radical but its also apropos Metaphorically speaking the web is pretty wet Before the web existed and before the Internet existed there were computers but they were big and lonely They couldnt really talk to one another I mean sure you could connect similarpieces of hardware that spoke similar protocols but that was just a network To connect disparate global machines you would need a network of networks And in the 1960s a bunch ofbrilliant minds collaborated on just such a thing Now at the time the phonecompanies werent very interested and because no single institution couldfoot the entire responsibility and computing power needed for dedicated lines Well more innovative and efficient methods were used A system spanning many nations is international So a system spanning many networks is an Internetwork It wouldnt be until 1974 in this very document that the word Internetwork would be officially shortened to what weuse today  Internet On October 29th 1969 exactly 100 days after we first landed on a distant rock across space we first landed a letter on a distant screen across the InternetLeonard Kleinrock and a team at UCLA decided to send the word login to a different model of computer at Stanford They sent the L and it arrived They sent the O and it arrived And then the system crashed But still the first message sent over an Internet was a big deal On a list oftechnological achievements it would rank quite high even though it was literally lo Fastforward two decades CERN is working on a lot ofdifferent projects with different people and technologies to figure out who or what is doing what You can just look it up on the InternetBut the way information was organized on the internet was illogical Based on hierarchies  linearly it was lame And this annoyed a guy named Tim BernersLee You see  you could follow atree for a really long time only to reach a person or technologyinvolved in some other project and for information on that you have togo back to the beginning and start all over again So in March of 1989 Tim BernersLee wrote a powerful paper simply titledInformation management A Proposal He argued that notes with links like references between them is far moreuseful than a fixed hierarchical system Instead of trees BernersLee was proposing a web Webbed systems that connect documentsin nonlinear ways already existed They were called hypertextBut Tim BernersLee officiated the marriage of hypertextwebs and the Internet to produce a web that was worldwideIt was the vast connected logical and useful partnership needed to make theInternet the most quickly adopted form of communication in our species history The Internet connects participants the web connects informationSpecifically hypertext documents accessed via the Internet You can see the computer Tim BernersLeecreated the world wide web with in the London Science MuseumTwentyfive years ago if you had unplugged this computer youwould have literally shut down the entire web The first website was infocernch Today itprovides a simulator that allows you to view the web as it appeared as a baby Weve come a long way since thisIf you really want your mind blown check out Oneseconddesignlycom on the webYou can see how many Facebook likes Tweets and even emailsare sent every second and how many have been sent since youfirst opened the page Isaac Asimov once said that Earth shouldhave been named ocean because the sea is its dominant feature Our oceans are vast and dangerous and deep and mysteriousSo its no mystery that when people needed a metaphor to describe the Internet and the seemingly endless and often uncharted web of hypertext it delivered they ran for the sea We surf the web navigating streams of data There are pirates andfloods and phishing Even blogs and vlogs have theirlinguistic origins in logs  records originally kept bycaptains at sea Like liquid water the web is a phenomenal solvent It makes material widely accessible and available It has been estimated that every webpage is an average of only 19 clicks away from every other web page Like our oceans the web is really just one global sea And like our oceans the web is an ecosystem we need to be careful to protect It is flexible and flowing and as we are finding out the web like liquid water is somethingyou can see yourself in In the 1990s Douglas Rushkoff coined the term screenagers to describe a generationthat for the first time ever was growing up to think that images on screens werent just something to passively stare at but instead were something to be manipulated Well today its even more extreme The tools and connectivity provided bythe Web allow us to think of images on screens not just as things to manipulate but as things to project our own identities onto Not everyone who does this is aprofessional storyteller or acclaimed poet or coherent But content aside hyperlinked webs ofhuman expression are incredibly rich enviroments and they exercise the brain more so than books Well for the sake of argument lets read from Everything Bad is Good for You a book by Steven Johnson Now in this passage he imagines a world in which books were invented after video games and the World Wide Web Kids everywhere are starting to readthese new fangled books and teachers and parents areconcerned He imagines they might say something like this Perhaps the most dangerous property of these books is the fact that they follow a fixed linear path You cant control their narratives inany fashion You simply sit back and have the story dictated to you For those of us raised on interactivenarratives this property may seem astonishing Why would anyone want toembark on an adventure utterly choreographed by anotherperson But todays generation embarks on suchadventures millions of times a day Reading is not an active participatory process its a submissive one The book readers of the youngergeneration are learning to follow the plot instead of learning to lead Interesting But you might be thinking come on Michael you cant set content aside that easily What about all the dumb and superficialstuff the web propagates I mean surely a lot of it is just completelyuseless Were humans after all we should be valuing reason Maybe But is that really what makes us specialAs Unamuno said more often I have seen a cat reason than laugh or weep Perhaps it weeps or laughs inwardly But then perhaps also inwardlya crab resolves equations of the second degree What if cheaplaughs and sappy poems and gossip and whining and drama and selfies really are the most human thing the web has allowed us to do Thats deep But not as deep as the Deep Web the hidden web The part of the web invisible to search engines Now most of this stuffis innocuous content hidden behind pay walls or password protection or dynamically created web pages But we havent even indexed this stuffAnd its not 1 of the web its not 10 Its 80 of the entire World Wide Web The web is a deep ocean and we are frantically making waves in itFor instance take a look at real time emoji usage on Twitter and say a fewwords of encouragement to be least popular emojiWe are also exploring the web frantically Its an entirely newfrontier Every single day Google receives 500 million search queries it has never been asked before Where will all of this exploration lead Who knows But to go back to our metaphorthe very same suits we built to explore the depths of the ocean inspired and enabled the suits we would later use to go beyond Earth So keep exploring keep surfing And as always thanks for

How Many Things Are There?,2014-04-29T01:39:08Z,8.783333333333333,8096120,212879,Hey Vsauce Michael here If you threw every single human alive today intothe Grand Canyon we would not fill it up We could make a pile about this big Thats it Thats all of us All 7159 billion of us in one place A species portrait It kinda puts humanity into perspective and you So does this Everyday youproduce about one to two litres of spit which means in your entirelifetime altogether you will not produce enough spit to fill an Olympicsize swimming pool So far 560 billion Lego parts have been manufactured and the totalnumber of grains of sand on Earth is estimated to be 75 times 10 to the 18th But heres the thing how many things are there total Well how do you define a thingWell lets say its a thing if you can think about it or talk about itIf you can call it a thing its a thingThis is going to be a lot of things Things can be real imaginary impossible ideas are things things canbe looked forward to and things can be in the past or yellow or concrete or abstract things can happen and some things probably wont Making a video about how many things there are Thats a thing that Im doing right now Lets count everything Right away the answer seems obvious The word thing is so vague the answer is clearly infinite possibly not All we have to do is take the maximumnumber of physical things things out there in the realworld beyond our minds we could in theory measure and add to that thetotal number of things we could imagine The total number of thoughts possible For the purposes of this video letsassume that numbers and math and the laws of physics exist as part of the way our universe is But the names andrepresentations theyve been given are the products of thinking minds and those things are well things that we can count And theres no reason to double countAll of the indivisible pieces that make up me particles or strings or whatever are the same as the thing that has been named me Abraham Lincoln has a great quote about this How many legs does a sheep have if you call its tail a leg Four Because calling a tail a leg doesnt make it one Okay lets begin When counting the number of physical things in the universe we hit an unknown How big is the universe The entire universe could be infinite or it could be finite but edgeless for avariety of reasons There could also be other universes But its unclear whetherwell ever be able to actually see all these things Instead what we are stuck withand what we usually mean when we say the universe is the observable universe whose future visibility limit has beenestimated to be only 62 billion lightyears in any direction Thats it This is likely the onlyinventoryable space well ever need to worry about And it contains roughly on average ten to the eighty elementaryparticles Particles with no further internal parts as far as we currently now So thats our answer right There are ten to the eighty physical things that exist out therebeyond our own minds Any other physical thing  water dogsplanets saxophones  are just names given toparticular arrangements of those same ten to the eighty particles But wait what if in the future we discover that what wecall elementary particles today are actually just made out of smallerthings we should have counted instead Well to cover ourselves lets count the maximum possible number of thesmallest measurable thing Something the size of a Planck volume 10 to the power of 183 things that small could fit within our observable universe I like this number 10 to the power of 183 You couldnt easily argue there were more things than that in the physical realworldBut you could imagine A Planck length a Planck volumeThats just the smallest measurable amount of spacenot the smallest possible You could imagine a half Planck volume a 10000th of a Planck volume But that would just be a thought and only ever a thought So how many possible thoughts are there Its probably safe to say thatthe number of possible thoughts is indeed infinite For example numbers You cant say theres a limit tothe biggest number we can imagine But unlike physical things that existwhether or not we have discovered them do unthought thoughts already exist It seems more likethe pool of possible thoughts is really just one thing anactual elements from that set dont become things by themselves until we thing them that is we or some other mind thinksabout them or talks about them and theres a limit tohow many things we or anything else could ever thing our observable universe is only so bigand it will contain usable energy for only so long After about 1 trillionto a hundred trillion years the supply of gas needed to form newstars will be exhausted and the lights will startgoing out onestar at a time After a Google years the amount of usable energyleft in the universe will be 0 and nothing will be able to happen to calculate the maximum number upthoughts that could be thought inside our observable universelets take all of its mass and turn it into humanbrains that just think new and random thoughtsfrom the beginning of time until the universe runs out of usableenergy a Google years of thinking But wait what if there are alien brains or for all we know Earthlingbrains that think faster than we can okay well to besafe lets not turn all of that mass intohuman brains lets use it to build a giant hypothetical machine that computes atthe fastest speed possible given the speed of light in the uncertainty principle BremermannsLimit its 136 times ten to the fifty bitsper second per kilogram of material now a highend estimate for thetotal mass of the observable universe is 34 times ten to the the 60 kilograms which used exclusively for the bestpossible computing machine could altogether process 4624 times ten to the 110 bits per second Now with 3154times 10 to the 116 seconds available from the beginning oftime to the heat death of the universe and an assumption that the averagethought takes about a sentance worth of information to describe say about 800 bits we get a total of 1458 times ten to the 227 things that could ever be thought or imagined That number is huge In the observable universe the universe as we will everknow it the number of thoughts that can be thought is so much larger than the number of physicalthings there can be with out imagination and if you were to combine thetwo totals the number of physical things wouldbarely make a difference So funny enough when it comes to every thing in the universe it really is the thought that counts And as always thanks for watching,132.29601518026567,elementaryparticles,0.0,1.0,C6eOcd06kdk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk
Where Is This Video?,2014-04-15T02:12:18Z,7.666666666666667,7539719,241290,Hey Vsauce Michael here Steve Seitz and Chuck Dyer used view morphing to digitally reveal a side of the Mona Lisa weve never seen beforeWhat it would look like if she stared directly at us Thats her but it seems a bit unfamiliar I mean there is only one iconic view of the Mona Lisa Theres only onephysical object you can look at to say that you saw the Mona Lisa withyour own eyes Photographs existThere are copies you can also look at There are forgeriesthere are parodies but the true original Mona Lisa is in the LouvreThats where it is But where is this video Seriously where is this video I mean its on your screen right now but itsalso on a lot of other screens Wheres the original Well its stored on YouTube servers and theoriginal export is on my hard drive but those are just instructions for making the video This video is anywhere Every stream every viewing of this videois as Bill Thompson would say a digital simulacrum of something thathas no original So how does a museum curator or an archaeologist deal with this Well they are rethinking curating I mean take a look at this sculpture The distance from this sentence to your eye is my sculpture Thats pretty cool but how do you put something like that in amuseum This sculpture and this video can be endlessly copied and every version ismade out of different stuff at different times a bit like your body Theres an identity crisisgoing on As I discussed before every few years nearly all of your atoms are replaced Old ones leave new ones come inWhere is the original you Like this video you are really just theresult of a set of instructions being followed And in our cases interestingly those instructions are kind of forgeries The 12 Million Stuffed Shark is a great book about the art world Itmentions that at one point in history there were 600 Rembrandts hanging inmuseums and 350 Rembrandts in privatecollections The only problem is Rembrandt scholarssay that Rembrandt only ever made 320 paintings Mistaken identity forgeries and phonies have been around for a long time In 1496 a young Michelangelo the sameMichelangelo that painted this forged a statue He treated thestatue with acid to make it look not like his own work but like the workof ancient Greeks or Romans so he could sell it for more moneyBut really whats wrong with a forgery I mean sure supporting forgeries islike supporting plagiarism but as far as intrinsic aesthetic properties go whats the difference Whether painted by Da Vinci or a dog orcopied perfectly by a robot wouldnt the Mona Lisa smile just as mysteriously and cooly Well heres the thing We feel like the original the Mona LisaDa Vinci originally made has an aura about it As Richard Wiseman discussed in Quirkology  a great book  psychologistPaul Rosen once studied just how obsessed we are with relics things important merely because of theirauras He found that people were more willing to wear a sweater that had been dropped in dog poop thanthey were to wear a sweater they had been told what was once owned by a mass murdererWe are influenced by auras Right now I am in Mougin The city insoutheastern France where Picasso died On one occasion Picasso refused tosign a painting he knew he had painted saying I can paint a fake Picasso just like anybody else You can disown your own paintings and you can disown your children butyou can claim to have created your own paintings but can you really claim to have created your own children Lets explore a metaphorYour mother is a 3D printer that printed you But hold on your parents conceived you and curated you cared for youBut the actual blueprints that made you were outside of their conscious control Your blueprint is a forgery It has been copied replicated over andover again ever since the very first group of molecules were arranged in away that automatically replicated billions and billions of years agoIts not a perfect forgery Changes occur every time makingsuccessive copies a little bit different But 999 percent of your DNA isnt different from anyone elses Now you might say but wait Michaelwe all look so different Kind of But thats also because your brain is particularly good at recognizingdifferences amongst things that you are familiar with Its called the crossrace effect and its the reason new twins youve never met before looktotally the same until you get used to them Its the reason people from a cultureyoure not use to tend to be more difficult to distinguish And thereason say a big group of black labs youve never met before all kind of look like the same black lab We all have a common descendant a commonperson our DNA has been replicated from over and over again making us in a funny way a big bunch of forgeries Go back 50 forgeries ago 50 generations ago and thats enough toconnect every single human living on Earth Ive said this before you are at least 50th cousins with everyone else living on the planettoday But we can go back further than that as Guy Murchie famously did You seeanimal populations and even molecule populations experience replication variation and selective pressures which means you are trillionth cousins with all life on Earth and technically speaking quadrillionth cousins with water and trees and rocks Its a beautiful notion but its anything but new The word human comes from a word for soil And compare the Hebrew word for groundwith their name for the first man You are quadrillionth cousins with dirt with rocks with trees with plastic withthe very clothing you are wearing right now So whether youre fightingwith a stranger in a bar or stubbing your toe on a rock its all just a family squabble And as always thanks for watching Oh hey youre

What if the Moon was a Disco Ball?,2014-04-03T18:21:00Z,6.083333333333333,9365724,222319,Hey Vsauce Michael here If we turned the Moon into a giant disco ball day and night would not be a disco party Instead of diffuselyreflecting sunlight onto all of us a mirrortiled moon would reflect specularly You would be lucky to momentarily catch a single reflected beam of sunlight Now with the help visuals by Nick fromYeti Dynamics who you should subscribe to immediately lets see what would occurif a disco ball moon actually happened Heres the Earth with an imaginaryscreen behind it so we can track the path of reflections from a disco ball Moon Its 3012 mirrortiles are ten kilometres thick and between 100 and 150 kilometres across And as you can see the beams of sunlight they reflect would only intersect with Earth briefly and rarely  a few every month or so wouldrace past at more than 20000 kilometers a second From the surface of Earth theyd just betiny flashes in the sky 01 percent as bright as the regular Sun and would last a fraction of a secondThe Earth Sun and Moon just arent an ideal locations for disco ball effects But if our disco ball moon was closer and orbited earth not 384000 kilometers away but less than 450 as far as theInternational Space Station does it would be torn apart by gravitational title forces Shoot Also the Moon doesnt really rotate from our perspective like a fun disco ball It liberates but its starting to looklike instead of an awesome lunar party decoration a disco ball moon would just be a lunar party pooper So for the sake of investigation letsallow this disco ball Moon to not be torn apart and allow it to spin in the sky Now were talking Occasionally we would get glitteryreflections of a dimmer image of the Sun From the surface of Earth this is what we would see You know being able to see Earth reflected is almost cooler Its like being a bacterium on a giants face whos looking into a mirror You can see the giant but not yourself It kinda makes you feel small But it would be a great way to take planetary selfies So lets watch a mirror the width of theMoon orbit as close as the ISS does From the surface of Earth it would look like this The strobe lights around the edge bythe way are ten kilometres across Pretty cool Now finally lets take a look at theMoon as a rotating disco ball from low orbit The Moon is not a disco ball and likely never will be Its just a diffuse source of illumination But its illuminating in a different way to imaginewhat would occur if that actually happened Woah And as always thanks for watching,75.45205479452055,diffuselyreflecting,0.0,1.0,w8I25H3bnNw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8I25H3bnNw
Risk.,2014-03-23T01:43:07Z,8.1,8740898,246947,Hey Vsauce Michael here When will you die I dont mean you specifically I mean the mean of you all  the average Vsauce viewer By combining WorldHealth Organization life tables with YouTube analytics for Vsauce viewers we can calculate that the average date everyone over the age of 15 watching this video right now will die on is 842 in the morning November 28th 2059 The mode is in 2073 Morbidly but mathematically about 340 of the people who watch this video thisweek will not be around at this time next year These statistics are based onaverages but interestingly the average person considers him orherself anything but average Studies have consistently shown that the average person believes he or she willlive a longer and healthier life than the average person We overestimate the likelihood that bad things willhappen to other people and underestimate the likelihood that they will happen tous Its a natural part of our psychology but yeah we miscalculate risk in many fascinating ways KC Cole points out that we areoften more responsive to threats that are personal exotic erratic and dramatic than we are to threats that are well more likely I love one of her examples  imagine aworld where cigarettes are harmless but one cigarette pack out of every eighteen thousand sevenhundred and fifty contains a single cigarette laced with dynamitethat when lit violently explodes blowing the users head off People would be loudly and messily losing their heads everyday all over the world but in that imaginary universe the samenumber of people would die every day because of smoking that already do The results would just be more shocking moreimmediate and probably more likely to affect our decisions Last month I and some of my favouriteYouTube creators met with President Obama about the decisions Americans make when it comes toprotecting themselves from the cost of staying healthy The issue with healthcare is mired in conflict and debate matched only by the turmoil of riskassessment going on in our own minds Our myelinated machines use more biases andshortcuts to evaluate probabilities than can fit in a single video but aparticularly strong example is the availability heuristic Ourtendency to think that something is more likely because it happened recently or thereare more examples of it happening available in our memories not because itactually is more likely We also over exaggerate risks we donthave control over while being comparatively fearless inthe face of equal risks we nonetheless can control ChiantiStars famous 1969 study on risk found that people were willing to accept risks1000 times greater if they could control them for instancedriving a car than if they didnt have control for instance anuclear disaster Lets talk about Abraham Wald Only so much extra armour can be added toan airplane before it becomes too heavy to fly Now during World War 2 the US militarynoticed the planes returning from enemy territory were usually damagearound the wings the body and the tail gunnersSo they put more armour on those areas But it didnt make adifference The same number of planes continued to be lost So the military hired Wald for his mathematical super powersHe told them to put what little armour they could on the parts of the planes that werent being hit Why Well because returning planes were survivors They took damage in areas where a planecan take damage and survive Damage to other areascaused the plane to not returnWald was protecting them against survivorship bias  only paying attention to successes A similar phenomenon ispartly responsible for why music feels like it was just better back inthe day than it is now Is that really true or are we just remembering the good stuff Walds work savedthousands of lives and made flying safer for many more Tragically a few yearslater Wald and his wife died in an airplane crash You cant predict how and when you will die its not that easy But a few risk scoring systems have been created to make the discussion and comparison ofhazardous behaviors clearer The micromort was conceived by Ronald A Howard and is an amount of riskequal to a one in 1000000 probability of dying John Green discussed Micromorts in a fantastic mental floss video youshould watch if you havent already He points out that a single skydivetemporarily increases your death risk by seven micromorts  a seven in 1000000 chance of dying Thats the same as smoking 5 cigarettes Its beenestimated that you gain one micromort for every half litre of wine you drink Every year you spend drinking Miami tap water every 1000 miles you fly in a jet plane every 230 miles you travel by car every20 miles you travel by bicycle and every 6 miles you travel by motorcycle or canoe There is a happier unit of risk  the microlife Proposed byDavid Spiegelhalter and Alejandro Leiva a microlife is gained by doing helpful things In small quantities their benefits are roughly linear and one microlife is the equivalent of 30 extra minutes of lifeTwenty minutes of moderate exercise gives you two more microlives Two hours of sedentary behavior 1 microlives Plenty of nonscientific websites exist that allowyou to calculate when you will die based on your life expectancy and habits PokeMyBirthdaycom is the kind of goofy site that takes a nonetheless interesting lookat not your death but your birth Enter your birthday andsee when you were conceived when your mother probably first realizedshe was pregnant with you and the dates your parents created ormoved into position the two cells that eventually became the thirty trillion cells that are now watching this video Every single person who ever died died right here on planet Earth Except for three The crew of Soyuz 11 On June 30th 1979 their cabin depressurized while returning to Earth before theycrossed the agreedupon boundary between Earth and outer space Far from any populated area a threesided metallic columns sits where theyre craft landed in Kazakhstan Its a remote memorial to humankinds remotest deaths We havent all died here on Earth but so far we have all been born here Thanks for being here Stay safe and as always  thanks for watching,127.40740740740742,skydivetemporarily,0.0,-1.0,w-CK8VxMz9g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-CK8VxMz9g
What Is The Resolution Of The Eye?,2014-03-10T23:45:45Z,9.733333333333333,14413618,370987,Hey Vsauce Michael here I am at the White House in Americas capital Washington DC America makes a lot offeature films every year   Hollywood But they dont make the mostfeature films every year Nigeria makes more But the country that makes the mostfilms every single year is India Every two years the country of India fills up enough film with uniquefeature films that stretch all the way from this cityMumbai to where I live in London Thats double what Hollywoodproduces in two years That is a lot of movies but is reallife a movie Ive discussed the framerate of the human eye before but how does the resolution of the human eye compare to a camera or screen VHS LaserDisc DVD Bluray IMAX Numbers like these arepixel dimensions When multiplied they tell us the total number of pictureelements an image is made up of A figure often used to describe digitalcameras It might sound like more is better but to be sure numberslike 1920 by 1080 are not resolutions per seMore pixels is only part of the equation Resolution is about distinguishing fine details and that depends on a lot of other factors For instance the amount of light thesize of the sensors what the millions of pixels are actuallyencoding and how close the subject is I mean up close Salvador Dalis painting of his wifelooking at the Mediterranean can be resolved into boxes But from a far well its Abraham Lincoln For crying outloud on a small enough screen from far enough away low and highsocalled resolutions on screens arent even resolved differently from one another by your eye How different nearby pixels are from oneanother also matters This is called spatial resolution For instance if I go outoffocus the number of pixels in the video framestays the same but you cant resolve as much detail Now with all this in mind we can still compare human vision to a digital imageby asking a better question Assuming everything else is optimal howmany pixels would you need to make an image on a screen large enough to fillyour entire field of view look like real life without anydetectable pixelation Now we are getting somewhere Kind of The analogy is still crudy because a camera snaps an entire frameat once whereas our eyes move around The brain amalgamates their constant stream of informationinto what we call vision  sight In fact the image created by theeyeball alone during a single glance would hardly even be acceptable on abroken TV screen We think our eyes create images like this pictureGuy took of me with a camera But for one thing unlike a camerayouve got some stuff in the way For instance you are always looking at your own nose and maybe evenglasses if you have them Luckily our brainsprocess those stimuli out because they dont matter and they dont change But thinking those arethe only difference is a pitfall literally latinly The fovea gets its name from the Latin for pitfall The fovea is the pit on yourretina that receives light from the central two degrees of your field of view about the areacovered by both your thumbs when held at arms length away Optimalcolour vision and 2020 acuity are only possible within that little areaWhen it comes to these limitations XKCDcom has a brilliant illustration It points out other problems like blind spots  literal blank spaces in our vision where the optic nerve meetsup with the retina and no visual information is received If you bought a camera that did this you would return it You can find your own blind spot by closing your right eye fixating your left eyeon a point in front of you extending your left thumb and then moving it leftofcenter slightly slowly carefullyuntil its not there anymore CrazyBut of course we dont see the world horribly likethis because our eyes are constantly moving dragging foveal resolution wherever we need it And our brains complex visual system fills in details merges images from both eyes and makes alot of gueses What we actually see is a processed imageNot computergenerated imagery but well meatgenerated imageryThe neon color spreading illusion is a great way to demonstrate thisdifference There is no blue circle in this picture The white here is the same as the white here A camera isnt fooled a screen isnt fooled only you and the fleeting gumbo ofingredients you call perception is fooled Our vision is not analogous to a camera But ourreformulated question can still be answered because human anatomy allows usto resolve to differentiate certain angular distances Famously Roger N Clark used a figure of 059 arcminutesas the resolution of the human eye to calculate based on the size of our total field ofview how many of these distinct elementscould fit inside of it The result was an approximation ofexactly what we want to know how many individual picture elements pixels  our vision can appreciate His answer 576 megapixels That many pixels packedinside a screen large enough to fill your entire field of view regardless of proximity would be close enough to be undetectableby the average human eye But we should factor in the fovea because Clarks calculation assumesoptimal acuity everywhere it allows the eye to move around But a single glance is more analogous toa camera snap and as it turns out only about 7 megapixelspacked into the two degrees of optimal acuity the fovea covers during a fixed stare are needed to be rendered undetectableIts been roughly estimated that the rest of your field of view would only need about 1 megapixel more information Now that mightsound low but keep in mind that there are plenty of modern technologies thatalready use pixel densities better than we can differentiateAs Bad Astronomer deftly showed Apples Retina Displays truly docontain pixels at a density average eyesight cant differentiate from typical reading distances But the fact thatthere are screen sizes and pixel densities that can fool the human eye is not a sign that we see in any kind of megapixelly way Human vision just isnt that digital I mean sure like acamera sensor we only have a finite and discrete number of cells in our retina But the brain adjusts our initialsensations into a final perception that is a wishywashy topdown processed blob of experience Its not made of pixels and furthermore unlike a camera its notsaved in memory with veracity like a digital camera file Absolutely no evidence has ever beenfound for the existence of a truly photographic memory And whats evencooler is that not only do we not visually resolve the real world like a movie camera we also dont narratively resolveconflict and drama in our lives like most movie scripts The point ofall of this what Im getting at is an idea An idea that initially drew me to this question We play roles in the movie of life but its a special kind of movieCinematic victories and struggles are often discrete resolved like pixels withunbelievably perfect beginnings and endings whereas the real world is all about ear resolution I like how Jack Angstreich put it in Cinemania In a movie a character can make adecision and then walk away from the camera across the street and have the creditsroll freezing life in a perfect happily ever after But in the real world after you crossthe street you have to go home The world goes on Life doesnt appear in any particular pixel resolution or narrative resolution Things are continuous The world was running beforeyou came around and it will continue running after you are gone Your life is a plotonly in so far as it begins and ends and occurs in medias res Damerish opens illustration forCharles McGraths endings without endings says it perfectly In life there rarely is the end There is only the and And as always thanks for

DISTORTIONS,2014-02-14T00:00:20Z,11.583333333333334,12094432,315237,Hey Vsauce Michael here I am distorted The pixels you are watching have been time displaced Theyve been mapped onto a gradient and the darker the region theyre mapped tothe further behind they lag The effect is really fun but its certainly not realistic Or is it Many many popular digital cameras sufferfrom lag induced distortion like what you just saw though much much more subtle Usually completely unnoticeable Its called a rolling shutter Instead of snapping a full exposure at once they quickly scan strips of each frame Its usually undetectable But when thesubject changes faster than the camera scans you get the famous geloey wobbly rolling shutter effect Really fast things like vibrating guitar strings andairplane propellers are famous victims but people can be tooLuke Mandel submitted this photo to Boing Boingnet His camera scans left toright and in this instance managed to capture a blink eyes closed when the scan began and then open in thereflection scanned a fraction of a second laterBut the rolling shutter effect is not just a neat curiosity It represents a fundamental and inescapable distortion that affects everything we see Rolling shutter or not First things first lets talk about distortions A hallucination is a distortion of reality when there is no apparent stimulus If you are merely misinterpreting an actual stimulus that is an illusion But some distortions occur before our sense organs and minds get in the way They are called optical phenomena They are not theresult of sensation or perception gone wrong Instead optical phenomena are distortionscaused by the mere properties of light and matter in and of themselves If you look up at the sky and see a giant vivid drinking gourd you are hallucinating But if you see a flat twodimensional connectthedotsBig Dipper you are seeing an illusion Its an illusion because those dots merely appear to be on the same plane likeholes poked in the dark roof of the sky In reality those dots are stars lightyears apart from one another in three dimensions As Celestrons brilliant free realtime3D visualization of space shows from different perspectives besides our own they look a lot less like a dipper or plough In fact all constellations and asterisms are geocentric illusions From a wider perspective their outlines point inward to the single lowly point in space that gave them their names But you cant blame us I mean Earth is the only perspective anyhuman has ever had And even Voyager 1the most distant manmade object is still not even close to being farenough away for the constellations to look even remotely different than they do here on Earth Its also not our fault our eyes and brains fault that distant distant stars werent included in our early cosmic connectthedot game Sure our eyesight could be better but optical phenomena are also to blame If it werent for red shifting and theinverse square law and light extinction distant things could be seen in all their glory The night sky would look phenomenal Many structures up there are huge Theyre just too dim for their hugeness to be appreciated When we see Hubble Telescope images ofdistant objects like the Helix Nebula its easy to think that without a telescope to zoom in the object must just be a tiny point in the sky But in reality even though the Helix Nebula is 700 light years away its 3 lightyears across If we could make the Helix Nebula less dim if our eyes could take a really long exposure of itwe would see the Helix Nebula as it really is  nearly 70 the apparent diameter of our Moon This is a serious pictureThat is how large the Helix Nebula would appear in thenight sky from Earth if it just wasnt so dim Our Moon is tiny in the sky by the way Its easy tothink of the moon as this huge baseballsized thing up there in the skybut thats an illusion Try this the next time you see theMoon Grab a sheet of notebook paper and you will notice that the angulardiameter of the Moon is the same size as a hole punched in asheet of notebook paper held in armslength away Seriously try itsometime It shows just how cute and tiny our little moon isThe Orion Nebula would appear even larger if we saw all of its light And the Andromeda Galaxy Just a smudge in the sky to our eyes But if oureyes were better at collecting dim light we would see Andromedas true extent in our sky Of course our night sky doesnt look like that Distant objects are dimmer thats a bummer But light stillwins when it comes to speed Light travels at the fastest speedIn fact in a vacuum light travels 300000 kilometres a second Thats fast But not really I mean not compared to how far apart things are in the universe Sydney Australia is 114th of a light second away from London But the Andromeda Galaxy is 2500000 light years away from London To put that in perspective lets take alight speed journey from London to Sydney It would look like this Ready Three two one go Nice Alright alright Heres the Andromeda Galaxy Okay now relativistic effects asidelets take a look at what it would look like to travel toward the Andromeda Galaxy at the speed of light Are you ready Alright Three two one go Yeah I mean seriously its pretty lame Even at the speed of light the fastest speed possible a year from now we wont even be a millionth of the way there Thats how far away Andromeda is Its almost sad in a way But this brings us back tothe rolling shutter effect The Andromeda Galaxy is huge Its morethan a hundred thousand light years across and our view of it is tilted Which means that on the plane we view it inlight from the back represents what Andromeda looked likethousands and thousands of years before what light from the front represents Changes in its appearance reach us sooner from the front than from the back Andromeda is rotatingspinning at hundreds of kilometers per second in some places Now a lag between light coming from near and far points on a spinning object results in a skewed image The rolling shuttereffect on a cosmic scale applied to say a chessboard seeing the front ahead of the back is pretty trippy and dramatic So does that mean we see wobbly funhouse mirror rollingshutter effect versions of Andromeda and other distant galaxies Well technically yeah but the distortion is negligible It may as well be ignored Why Well the speeds used in these visualizations are not to scale On average yes matter within galaxies orbits the galactic center at hundredsof kilometers per second but galaxies are so huge it takes them hundreds of millions of years to complete just one rotation In other words the lag between light reaching you from near and far points on a galaxy is nothing compared to how much time it takes matter in the galaxy to travel that same distance In the case of Andromeda if you insisted on seeing Andromeda as it really is that is corrected for any lag caused bythe fact that the speed of light is finite the most extreme points on the Galaxy would only need to be adjusted by about a 10000th of the width of any image In this case less than a pixel So its not a big deal But its not a nothing deal Its real In fact everything we look at is in some way distorted by the fact that the speed of light is finite Your own feet are about 5 to 6 light nano seconds away from youreyes which means when you look at your feet you are seeing where they were 5 to 6 nano seconds ago 5 to 6 nanoseconds in the past Of course a delay that brief is prettymuch undetectable but it is calculateable If it makes you feel a little sad to know that even with the sharpest mind or the best instruments appearances still depend on where you are That optical phenomena insure appearances are always relative Dont feel bad We call the people closest to us our relatives Were really just a family a big family of reference frames thatlike a family dont always agree but do have plenty of cool things to look at Id like to thank my editor Guy for help with the rolling shutter effect in this video And Id like to thank you because as always thanks for watching Oh heres something cool I will be at YouTube Fan Fest with HP

What's The Brightest Thing In the Universe?,2014-02-03T21:27:03Z,11.933333333333334,19201775,408060,Hey Vsauce Michael here This symbol commonly called a Yin Yang symbol is a taijitu meaning diagram of the supreme ultimate The principal of Yin and yang opposites existing inharmony is associated with ancient Chinesephilosophy But the very first use of the iconographythe classic symbol actually comes from a shield patternused by the ancient Romans seven hundred years before its first known use in ChinaA connection between the two has yet to be foundRegardless of who came up with it first the symbol was a bright ideaBut whats the brightest object in the entire universe Well apparent magnitude Commonly used when stargazing refers tohow bright an object appears to us say when looking up from Earth It depends on Earthcentric factorslike how close the object is to our planet Magnitudes are logarithmic and arranged like golf where a smaller number means a greater brightness But today Im looking for absolute magnitude a measure of how bright things all overthe universe near and far would be if we looked at themfrom the same distance Absolute magnitude will guideus to the most blinding light in the universe irrespective of it looking faint to us here on Earth just because its far away The difference is significant A 100watt light bulb placed closer than 8 centimetres  about3 inches  from your eye will appear brighter than the Sun in the sky But thats not fair If you could see the Sun and the bulb from the same distance the Sun would bea septillion times brighter Thats bright But the Sun shines punily compared to the rest of the cosmos If you could line the Sun up witheverything else out there giving every star and cosmologicalphenomenon a fair chance the Suns absolute magnitude would be 48 Not bad But check out R136a1 This nuclear fuelled beast isnt the biggest star in terms of volume but its 256 times more massive than our SunIts the most massive star ever found and its also the brightest Remember that lower absolutemagnitudes are brighter R136a1 isnt 48 like our Sun it is 126 which means it is 87 million times brighter than our own Sun But R136a1 isnt the brightest thing out thereWhen a giant star dies it explodes violently in what is known as a supernova or hypernova As I mentioned in my video How Hot Can It Getsupernovas can eject terrifying flashes of radiation known as gamma ray burstsArguably the brightest electromagnetic events inthe universe A typical gammaray burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as our Sun will release altogether in its entire 10 billion year lifetime If WR104 a gammaray burst future candidate directly struck Earth with such a beam for only 10 seconds astronomers predict it could deplete 25 of our ozone layer and lead to mass extinction and starvation The largest thermonuclear bomb ever detonated didnt do anything close to that and itwas exploded right here in our atmosphere Whereas WR104 is eight thousand light years awayYou cant even see it with your naked eye or a pair of binocularsBut gamma ray bursts are merely brief events lasting only a few minutes at most sometimes just a matter of milliseconds If you want the brightest sustained thing youll paradoxically have to look at the darkest thing Black holes To be fair dark matter is ostensibly darker But because dark matter has been hypothesized to not even interact with light with electromagnetism at all calling dark matter not bright is kind of like calling your peanut butter sandwich a not fast airplaneIts not really even in the same category Black holes however do interact with light reflecting so little well they dont let any escape at least not in a form resembling the way it came in Thats dark But the intense energies created byblack holes in the process of eating things like stars is anything but darkGas and debris from the stars they eat swirl into arcipluvian cosmic gallows known as accretion discs before making their final death plungeinto the black hole In the disc debris spins at unfathomablespeeds pulled around by a black hole billions of times more massive than our SunFriction in the accretion disk generates heat on a level difficult to fully appreciate Just as hot things glow the disk does too So brightly it has its own name A quasarQuasars shine thousands of times more brightly than even the brightest stars Im kidding its scarier than thatQuasars shine thousands of times more brightly than galaxies containing billions of stars The first identified quasar 3C 273has an absolute magnitude of 267 making it four trillion times brighter than our Sun about 100 times more luminous than thetotal amount of light produced by the entire Milky Way If you put 3C 273 33 light years away from us it wouldshine as brightly as our Sun   a mere 8 light minutes awayBlocking the brightness of a quasar with the corona graph reveals that quasars exist in thecenters of galaxies that are larger than them in area but are nonetheless drowned out by their light Such galactic centres are called active galactic nuclei The bulk of their energy spewing forthin the form of a powerful radiation jet the length of which puts even our solar system to shameThe visible part of the jet in this photograph for instance is solong it could stretch from the Sun to Pluto and back oneandahalf million times Now specifically if a large portion ofthis ajected energy heads toward Earth its responsible for what we call a quasar But if Earth is right and the activegalactic nucleus sights its got a scarier name a blazar And its blazar 3C 4543 that clockedin the greatest brightness ever observedAt historically high levels of activity it registered in absolute magnitude of 314 To put the brightness of quasars in yet another perspective take a lookat the one hundred thousandth picture snapped by the Hubble telescope This is a star a few hundred light years away And this thing looks just about as bright but it is a quasar 9 billion light years away Why are quasars so far away Well a quasar is not forever They are billions of light years away which means the light we receive fromthem the pictures we take of them are pictures of things happeningbillions of years ago They represent a phenomenon more common early in the universes history whenmonster black holes hadnt eaten all the stars around them to fuel theiraccretion discs and before those holes became too fat to be active Neil deGrasse Tyson points out that in order to remain a quasar producer a black hole must consume about 10 stars a year Many consume more than a thousand stars a year 600 Earths worth of matter every single minute The more stars a black hole consumesthe larger its event horizon becomes until eventually it no longer shreds stars apart to fuel an accretion discInstead it just swallows them whole in one dimmer but still terrifying gulp Quasars are some of the mostancient things in our universe If you could teleport instantaneously to one right now faster than light it would most likelyno longer be burning What we see are just their ghosts Light that left when they were active that traveled longer than they could live But quasars can still be born They can even be born right here in fact In my video What Will We Miss I pointed out thatthe Andromeda Galaxy is headed our way In 3 to 5 billion years it will collide with our own galaxy the Milky Way And the collision could rearrange stars near thegalaxys central black holes to be consumed reigniting a quasar right here in our galactic backyard Funny enough right now very few of us even see Andromeda even though all youneed is your unaided eye Light from our cities drowns out the night sky like a quasar drowns out its host galaxy ArtistThierry Cohen mocked up what big cities would look like if all their lights were off and the sky above them could be seen fully New York Hong Kong Shanghai Tokyo Los Angeles Its beautiful and rare In the 1990s during a blackout in the city of Los Angelesa number of residence actually called the police they wereafraid of mysterious glowing clouds hovering above the city They were seeing our galaxy for the first time in their lives At night artificial lights allow us to see whats around us but we lose whats above us The brightest places have the darkest emptiest skies Theres Yin and Yang again A taijituhas actually been lurking in this video the entire time The brightest things in the universe quasars are caused by the darkest things in the universe  black holes The process that unshackles the most light is caused by the thing that best imprisons it And as always thanks for

What Does Human Taste Like?,2014-01-21T23:08:00Z,10.216666666666667,15876598,349373,Hey Vsauce Michael here Eating your own boogers is gross but it might be smart Assuming you have clean fingers lung specialistFriedrich Bischinger points out that snot contains antiseptic enzymes that kill or weaken bacteria Reintroducing those crippled microorganisms may allowyour immune system to develop antibodies in relative safety Now that is good to know nose But is eating your own snot cannibalism Self cannibalism Just like a cow or chicken orfish or fruit or vegetable you are made out of alot of edible things The meat on an average humanbody contains 77000 dietary calories worth of nutritional energy Yum If you decide tobecome a cannibal just dont show up late for dinner or youll get the cold shoulder Jokes aside cannibalism is a major taboo Its offputting at a visceral level Humans have dignity they are morethan just skin bags full of organs Theyre more than just something to put on a plateBut human meat has been put on plates and in belliesThere are reports of cannibalism occurring in times of famine as a last resort and because of curiosity and art In the late 1980s artist Rick Gibson publicly ate human tonsils and other donated human parts in London and Canada In 2006 artist Marco Evaristti cooked and canned meatballs prepared with his own body fat removed via liposuction In 2011 Dutch TV presenters Dennis Storm and Valerio Zeno cooked and ate pieces of each other on a TV show whose title meant guinea pigsBecause both of them lived and both consented to the act they didnt do anything illegal One year later a Japanese man posted this tweet Five diners took up his offerand on April 13th 2012 they were served a 250 per plate meal consisting of his genitals A darker story occurred in 2001 when Armin Meiwes ate and killed a volunteer he found on the now defunct Cannibal Cafe Although his meal ostensibly consented to the menu Meiwes was convicted of murder and now serving a life sentence in prison has become a devout vegetarian Disgust aside one question remains If you were to use your taste buds to taste your bud what would it taste like To be clear taste is a sensation caused by somethingin your mouth chemically reacting with receptors in your taste buds Flavor is the even more complex experience of taste combined with smell andinformation from the trigeminal nerve about things like temperature texture pain and pungency as far as the cooked but otherwise unadulterated spiceless sauceless flavor of human meat The late William Seabrook provided in my opinion the best description While in West Africa Seabrookinterviewed members of the Gear tribe people who had eaten human flesh and found theirdescriptions unsatisfactory So when he returned to Paris he struck asneaky deal with an intern at the Sorbonne and obtained a chunk of human meat from an otherwisehealthy body recently involved in an accident He carefully preparedthe meat and wrote that quote It was like good fully developed veal Not young but not yet beef It was mild good meet with no other sharplydefined or highly characteristic tastes such as for instance goat high game and pork The steak was slightly tougherthan prime veal a little stringy but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible The roast fromwhich I cut and ate a central slice was tender and in color texture smell as well as tastestrengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know veal is the one meat to which at this meat is accurately comparableSeabrook never gave us anyrecipes or complementary flavor recommendations But that brings us to this videostitles second meaning What does human taste like What does the human palate preferInterestingly of all the possible combinations of identified flavors we consume human cuisine only features a relatively small number of recipes A couple of years ago scientificreports published a great paper on the chemistry and networks behind food pairing Researchers took 381 ingredients used infive global cuisines and 1021 molecular compounds known tocontribute to their flavors and created a flavor network The size of the bubble represents theingredients prevalence in cooking The thickness of the lines connectingingredients reflects the number of flavor inducing molecules they significantly share The researchers flavor network backbone spans fourteen different food categoriesand is quite interesting By comparing this network to tens ofthousands of recipes they found that North American andWestern European dishes tend to combine ingredients that share flavor compounds while East Asian cuisine avoids them But that trend was caused by a few out lighters in each cuisine thatif ignored caused the difference in amount of sharing to lessen Those few ingredients tend to be the most authentic They tendto be the most responsible for the taste palette of a regional cuisine and contribute to this illuminating visualizationBut some flavors dont go together in any cuisine For instance orange juice and toothpaste Why does orange juice tasteso disgusting right after brushing Well most toothpastes contain sodiumlauryl sulfate  a chemical that helps the paste get sudsy and frothy during use That action helps pull brushed offdebris away from your teeth but sodium lauryl sulfate alsosuppresses sweet receptors in your mouth and destroy phospholipids that inhibit your bitter receptors making sweet orange juice taste not so sweet and grossly bitter for up to an hour after brushing What interests me the most about flavoris the fact that the things that cause it eventually become you You are what you eat scientifically Your body is always losing dead cellsbut the elements and molecules you ingest are processed by your body into new body Heres a fun way to think about it Under the direction of DNA a cat is made out of air water and cat food Thats it Cats have less varied diets than humans We can taste sweetness but cats lack the gene required to do soHowever they can taste ATP a molecule that moves aroundchemical energy for cells to use in the body which may be a sign to them that theyre tasting meat The point is sights and sounds and textures and shapes and smells are the names we give to things thateventually become our memories But flavor is the name we give to theexperience of things that eventually become our bodies Contemplating the flavor of human meat is gross But think of it this way youre currently tasting humanyoure tasting human right now Your tongue and taste buds are incontact with your mouth almost constantly Now granted its moreof a passive thing  your mouth just happens to contain your tongue Youre not actually eating yourself but you kind of are Your body is constantly swallowingyour own mucus and digesting pieces of your body likedead cells from your tongue and cheek But thats nothingcompared to the self cannibalism of the sea squirtThe sea squirt lives a sort of selfcannibalistic Flowers for Algernon life When born it resembles a tadpoleand has a notochord putting it in the same phylum as humansIt swims around until it finds a nice place to adhere A rock a plant Once stuck it begins retrogressive metamorphosis Literally digesting its ownnervous system eating the closest thing it ever had to a brain and lives the rest of its life in asensile unlocomoting clump It is a bit of a downgrade but they are prime evidence that theevolution of the brain was spawned by the need to move as soonAs these guys dont need to move around they eat their brainsThat is way more extreme than the selfcannibalism you participate in every day by swallowing But dont feel badAbout every three months or so you swallow and digest your own body weight worth of you That means that every day you are alittle more than one percent of the mythical ouroboros the snake eating its own tail You are what you eat but you are also a thing that you eat And as

Why Is Your BOTTOM in the MIDDLE?,2014-01-07T22:37:53Z,10.366666666666667,6889574,179472,Hey Vsauce Michael here A human running like a quadruped is creepy Artist Rui Martins created this animation about a year ago 127 years ago Eadweard Muybridge shot these real imagesof a child with infantile paralysis walking on all fours Walking upright looks less unnatural our bodies areparticularly well suited for it Its one of the things the bulbous and prominent human bottom helps us doBut lets get to the bottom of a linguistic mystery Why is the bottom called a bottom when its in the middle of the body Your feet and legs are almost always at the same level or below your bottomI mean except for Navasana the yoga boat pose your bottom is anything but the actual bottom of your body Unfortunately there is no clearcut answer but there are butt loads of cool things to learn about butts A buttload is not just ajoke amount It is a very specific unit of measurement Historically it wasused to describe the capacity of a wine cask A butt is about 477 litres which means given the average volume of solid waste the rectum holds when a person says they have a buttload of something Technically they are saying they have enough of that thing to fill 3200 butts Using the word bottom to refer to your posterior is relatively new Cedric Watts has presented evidence thatin the late 16th century bottom could connote the human rear end but the first published use wasnt until 1794 in Erasmus Darwins Zoonomia The word bottom comes from words meaning foundation the lowest levelBut when standing or sitting the soles of your feet are more properly at the bottom and sure enough sole also means foundation bottomWhats going on here is probably a combination of torsocentric thinking and euphemism Bottom is a nice word for a sometimes dirty part and your bottom is the bottomof your digestive tract and the bottom of your torso the bottom of your body if you exclude your limbs For Prince Randian a man born in 1871 in British Guiana the bottom was the bottom Because of tetraamelia syndrome he was born with no limbs at all In 1889 PT Barnum brought himto the United States to perform in carnivals And you can see himlight a cigarette with no arms or feet in the 1932 film Freaks Bottom is just one of many wordswe have for the posterior the rear the backside derrière bum buns or in reference to its round shape moon Which is why exposing your bare buttocks is known as mooning an offensive gesture The earliest known instance of mooning wasrecorded by Flavius Josephus It occurred in 66 AD A Roman soldier mooned a group of Jews headed to a temple in Jerusalem His act of mooning spawned a riot and the subsequent overreaction on the part of the Roman military led to the deaths of thousands of people If you get mooned you will just like a guy who died September 14th1865 and is now buried in West Laurens New York Seymour Butts At least he didntshare his name with a former representative of New Hampshires second district The word bum predates the use of the word bottom for the rear by quite a lot Its believed that the word bumoriginated as an onomatopoeia for the sound of buttocks slapping against a flat surface Seriously Lazily sitting around on your bum all day gave American English the word bum a loafer an idle person And bums connotation of uselessness poor quality caused it to lend itself in the late 1960s to the word bummer an experience that was worthless   a letdown But to be clear your butt is a bottom kind of Its a bum but it is not a bummerYour butt is magnificent an example of what makes the human body so different Its shape comes from thegluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles as well as a layer of fatThat layer of fat makes the bottom a great cushion for sitting Other animals have to sit by resting weight on their legsbecause they lack the nice bulbous butt of the human Evolutionarypsychology suggests that our attraction to full firm bottoms on potential mates was probably naturally selected People in the past who liked big ol bottoms probably spread their genes quite well They probably had a lot ofreproductive success because the calle pigeon bottom is a sign of health and youth A bottom full of shapely fat is a great energy reserveThat energy can come in quite handy if food suddenly become scarce or during pregnancy or breast feeding Theres a great redditthread you can read if youd like this evolutionary psychology approach wrapped up in a Sir MixaLots I like big butts package Because we are bipedal in order to keepour torsos balanced while moving we require relatively giant and prominent muscles in our bottoms muscles that are so prominent we have compared to other apesvery defined intergluteal clefts Butt cracks This makes certain hygienic practices more common in humans than other animals But those prominent muscles are worth it Compared to horses and other quadrupeds humans can reach impressive longdistance aerobic endurance running speeds This is Katarina JohnsonThompsonan Olympic athlete from Great Britain and an excellent example of the fact that humans are the running animal Hi Michael Hi Katarina Take a look at this Ill make it brief but above and beyondother animals humans can sweat to efficiently dump body heatwe have short toes to provide more efficient force over long periods of runningour short neck ligaments keep our head perfectly stable when running our uniquely welldevelopedAchilles tendon converts elastic energy into kinetic energy very well and our tall narrow waistsprovide great counter rotation as our legs swing backwards and forwardsI like how PZ Myers sums it up Over long distances the average speed sustained by a horse is lessthan that of the human which means that a welltrainedconditioned human being can keep up with or even outrun a horse if the race is sustained long enough For this reason endurance running isstill practiced by a few people on Earth as a form of hunting and it may havebeen vitally important to prehistoric people Before domesticated animals andprojectile weapons and traps humans caught animals for food in an incredibly athletic way David Attenboroughdocumented this practice fantastically You should definitely watch this clip An animalwill sprint away from running human hunters but eventually have to rest Humans on the other handthough slow in the short run can keep going Like the tortoise they eventually beat the hare and can walk right up to theexhausted and overheated animal to kill it We dont have dangerous claws or massive teeth andwe can pretty much only outsprint vegetables But in the long run thanks to things like our impressive butts we have superior endurance when it comes to running It may be called a bottom but its at the top of the list of thingsthat make the human body amazing This video was inspired by Sport Relief A great cause that uses sport to raisemoney for vulnerable people here in the UK and abroad Check the description of this video tolearn more and watch their interactive video about how you can help out and get involvedBut wait a second if our bodies are so well developedfor endurance running how come we dont all run marathons How come we dont all enjoy running or do a lot of it Well the thing is all ofthis running specialization was naturally selected because it helped our prehistoric ancestors survive Actually enjoying all of that running was notnaturally selected it was just a part of their daily lives But that doesnt mean that today you cant get off your butt use your butt and be proud of it The next time someone calls you a butthead say thanks I always knew my head was asuperlative object that set me apart from the animal kingdom Katarina

Mistakes are everywhere they surround us like air To err is human Faults flaws faux pas fumbles and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today as the stuff weve gotten right For instance if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee why would there be so many ks Well the ks are silent by mistake The original old English forms of thesewords were pronounced with k sounds Knife knight knee But thats a bit of a mouthful to say andbecause reading and writing werent as common hundreds of years ago people just pronounced words the waythey want to do regardless of spelling Spelling is fun Warren G knows whatIm talking about In the fourth verse of his Whats Next he asks whats next Whats next whats NXET Spelling isnt the only thing we get wrong The history of science is a graveyard of dead an abandoned ideasFritz Machlup coined the phrase Halflife of knowledge The amount of timeit takes for half of the knowledge within a field to be superseded by new better ideasor to simply be shown untrue Donald Hebb famously estimated that the halflife of knowledge in psychology is just five years Humans are awesome dont get me wrongbut we tend to believe that what we currently think we know about the universe is reasonably correct even though statistics arent on our side Previous generations incorrectly thought the exact same thingabout what they used to think was true My favourite examples of the ubiquityof mistakes are production errors in popular songs Theyre like humbling Easter eggs just waitingto be found For instance  Buffalo Springfields For What Its Worth 26 second in the be in the lyric beware is clipped as is the p in people at 124 minute Once you hear the mistake its tough to unhear it In Hey Jude Paul McCartney misses a cord And if youlisten closely you can clearly hear him say Fing hll Seriously its in the actual song Go listen to it In fact theres an entirewebsite that chronicles mistakes in Beatles songs Take a look at this 700yearold prayer book A monk wrote it on fresh clean paper Im kidding of course He scraped the inkoff an older manuscript cut the pages and rotated them before writing all over them A mistake Well kind of Recent multispectral images of the prayer book have revealed thatthe old manuscript he erased was a previously unknown copy of a work by Archimedes It was called The Method and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years before Newton and Leibniz If that one monk hadnt erased that one book would we be hundreds thousands of yearsmathematically and technologically more advanced today than we currently are Its hard to say All that is certain is that we wouldcontinue to make ridiculous mistakes like the Mars Climate OrbiterThis 3276 million dollar expedition burned up in the red planets atmosphere because when calculating flight manoeuvres NASAused the agreedupon metric units while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system This is Neil Armstrong taking humankinds first steps on the Moon Its about the best footage we have The original tapes containingthe highest quality recording of that moment have been lost They were probably recorded over by later test missions Ten years ago Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while hunting outside of San DiegoHoping to attract the attention of rescuers he lit a small fire But that fire quickly got out of controland became a giant Cedar Fire It destroyed 300000 acres of land 2322 homes and killed 15 people The man carrying a wounded soldier inthis painting based on a photograph taken during World War I is Henry Tandey an English recipientof the Victoria Cross Four years after the event in this imageTandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sightsBut rather than kill the man Tandey took pity on his wounded stateand spared his life The German he allowed to live was this man Later the man whose life hespared wore his mustache shorter but still had the same name Adolf Hitler In 1918 did Henry Tandey miss a chance to killHitler Detailed researchers found that the exact days their units were in the samelocation dont quite match up The story is apocryphal but what is known is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting of Tandey and in 1938 when meeting with Neville ChamberlainHitler pointed to Tandey and told Chamberlain That man cameso close to killing me in 1918 that I thought Ishould never see Germany again So whos wrong Maybe Hitler confirmed the story merely because he hoped to make up extraevidence that providence had kept him alive to pursue his goals Either way someone is mistaken Missed opportunities are a bummerObsessing over them is not healthy but regret is a powerful emotion How do you deal with regret with guilt Can you In the early morning hours on abench outside a hotel in Anaheim this summer Ze Frank told me somethingI am going to paraphrase I love this metaphor Stuff in your past is like a carving on the bark of sapling Over time the scar the carving wont go away Because of the way trees grow it wontgo up or down much either itll just stay right where it began It might even get darker But it wont get bigger You however can You can keep growingdoing more things more branches being more things The wound wont getsmaller but you can make it a smaller part of who you are Maybe regrets are like that They stick around forever like arborglyphs Or maybe they make like a tree and leaf A red or purple leaf in the autumnAs days get shorter and chlorophyll production decreases the yellow and orange carotenoids which are always in leaves appear as the green fadesBut red and purple leaves are the interesting onesAs winter approaches it would seem to be a good time for trees to conserve energy but some trees do the opposite Instead of giving up they spend extra energy producing anthocyanins to turn their leaves red and purple hues These colours protect their leaves fromsun damage before their nutrients can all be used and may also be a defenceagainst insects looking for a parasitic homeA way for the tree to tell the insects Yes I am in part dying but not without a fight I am still very much vital Drought and even turn a kit applied by man can bring about these colors prematurelyWhen you look at beautiful autumn colours you are looking at stress But the bigger the fight the treesput up the more energy they put into their defences at thevery end the more brilliant their colours will be Winter will eventually come But scientifically the brightest deepest most remarkable colours come from not giving up too easily or quickly And as always

Moving Illusions,2013-12-10T17:39:01Z,10.783333333333333,16993346,298533,Hey Vsauce Michael here This is a completely still image but as your eye reads well Imsaying and jumps from word to word the paragraph will appear to slightly just subtly wave and boil The allusion is called anomalous motion Its neat But to say its fun is tautology because the word illusion literally means to have fun to mock to play with But illusions arent just fun and games They also teach us about our brains Anomalous motion for instance demonstrates that our brains process things at different rates and piece by piece After a saccade a quick eye movement higher contrast elements are perceived sooner than lower contrast ones When arranged in just the right waythis delay is exploited and your visual system only has one explanation Low contrast parts of the imagedidnt get processed later because this myelinated machine iswrong but rather because the image itself must be moving Akiyoshi Kitaokas brilliant Out of focus causes nearby neurones todisagree about the little slices they each detect Some see big changes after a saccade and some see hardly anyThis makes it difficult for our brains to calculate and factor in the effect of our own eye movements so the image itself appears to be moving But illusions arent just about moving They can also be moving poignant significant practical They can mean the differencebetween life and death like in nature or during World War I as dazzle paint on shipsThis form of camouflage doesnt conceal the object but rather makes it difficult for an enemy to ascertain its preys true shape and thus where its heading or how fast its going In 1955 the Soviet Union displayed their newBison and Bear longrange bombers at an air show It looked like they had a lot Afraid of falling behind the USramped up production on their own B52 bomber But the whole thing was an illusion In the Soviets film of the air show the same few planes had been flownpast the camera multiple times in formations that gave the illusion ofthem having more bombers than they really did By the end of the1950s the Soviet Union only had about 150 longrange bombers whereas the Americans fooled by the illusion had built nearly 2000 at a cost of 900 million dollars Architecture is full of examples of realworld practical optical illusions My favorite are Disney castles They appear huge but its forced perspective  a lie The tops appear further away from us because they are actually quite tiny Illusions also tell us about ourselves culturally The MüllerLyer illusion is classic The horizontal lines are all the samelength but the bottom ones appear longer to people from Western cultures familiar with our rules of perspectiveand manmade straight lines However bushmen fromSouthern Africa and tribespeople from northern Angola or the Ivory Coast arent fooled at all Akiyoshi Kitaoka is using optical illusions to discover glaucoma earlier than current techniques can And anamorphic illusions are used to save lives They look weird from any perspective but onefrom which they seem to pop out defying the environments actual shape Hoping to remind drivers to always pay attention traffic safety organizations inWest Vancouver Canada placed a skewed decal on the road From the right perspective the perspective of the driver in this caseit becomes a 3D illusion of a child you are about to hit Slow down Brusspub has made someincredible examples of the 3D effect such illusions can happen This object Just an anamorphic projection Anamorphic illusions have alsobeen used to safely practice political dissent In 1746 supporters of the Stuart claim to the British throne had to be quiet about it It was treasonous So sympathizers served things on trays that looked like this Innocuous enough until only supporters were aroundAnd it was safe for someone to place a reflective goblet or cylinder on the trayrevealing the trays anamorphic secret a hidden portrait of their elicit love Charles Edward Stuart himself The Encyclopedia Titanica lists descriptions of everybody recovered from the Titanic Its quite macabre Why was the iceberg not seen until it was too late And why did the nearest ship  the Californian  not come to the Titanics rescue sooner Tragic questions whose answers might be optical illusions The Titanic was sailing through conditions perfect for mirages This theory points out that the Titanic sank at the border of the warmer Gulf Streamand the frigid Labrador Current where the normal case of cooler air at higher altitudes was inverted  a thermal inversion Now because the temperature of aireffects its index of refraction a thermal inversion means light bending in a typical ways If light reaches the eye from higher up than usual objects can appear to float Seriously Like this ship off the coast of Australia A thermal inversion can also renderobjects completely unrecognizable hidden within a haze like this ship Or like an iceberg Or a sinking ship in need of help The Delboeuf illusion may be causing teeth to split and crack more often than they should when dentists drill holes in them Doctor Robert OShea observed 8 practicing dentists and found thatthey were all drilling holes that were too big even though they knew the correct size to be drilling Why Well it may be the same reason people eat more food when theyre given a bigger plate Objects appear smaller when enclosed by larger areas Holes of the same size may appeardifferent sizes on bigger teeth Dentists may be deciding that correctly sized holes drilled in the teeth need to be made larger not because they do but because perception is a tricky thing Illusions affect not only big ships and teeth but also your future The End of History Illusion is ourtendency to think of ourselves today as somehow done Sure I went through a lot of personal growthand changes in taste in the past but today who I am now this is pretty much the final me But thats not true Studies have consistently shown thatpeople underestimate just how different they will be say 10 years in the future even though they can easily point outhow much theyve changed since 10 years agoI like how Daniel Tomasulo puts it We believe we are going to live love and long for where whoand what we are thinking about right nowBut the research says it just aint so This too is a transient state Yogi Berra put it even more succinctly The future aint what it used to be Their advice is dont imagine your future Look at other people and theirexperiences instead take their advice Your imagination is just that their experiences are actual data Well of course its not that simple Which brings us to our final illusion The illusion of control Named by psychologist Ellen Langerits our tendency to believe we control the outcomes of things We demonstrably dont It can help motivate us to not give up and in healthy people at a healthy level it is optimistic selfappraisal But its a lie In one study traders in the City ofLondons investment banks were shown a graph of a real time stock price and given three buttons that secretly didnt do anything to affect the priceBut they were told the buttons might have an effect  try them out see what you can do Afterwards the traders were asked torate how much they felt they had been able to control the stock price with the useless buttons And it turns out the traders who reported the greatestsense of control over the stock price were the ones who scored loweston risk management tests and in the real world contributed the least to their companys profits and in terms of salary made the least money Its kind of a bummerThe illusion of control is a nice feeling but sometimes its finesometimes it even pays handsomely to admit you dont have control And as always thanks for watching,122.87480680061825,differencebetween,0.0,1.0,Iw8idyw_N6Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw8idyw_N6Q
Why Are Bad Words Bad?,2013-11-28T22:52:48Z,10.766666666666667,22313292,564111,Hey Vsauce Michael here When you call customer service and hear this to ensure quality service your call may be monitored or recordedtheyre not kidding Over the last year the Marchex Instituteanalysed more than 600000 recorded phone conversations Americans made to businesses in the United States Turns out people from Ohio were the most likely to use curse words  the A word the F word and the S word Washington state residents werethe least likely to use bad words But what makes a word bad Oh be careful because etymologically speaking even the word bad can be considered a bad word It began in old English as a derogatory term for an effeminate manEighty percent of swear words overheard in public in 1986 1997 and 2006 were essentially the sameOne third of all counts included the top two  the F word and the S word Slates brilliant Lexicon Valley podcast purported that these 10 words makeup about 07 of the average English speakers daily vocabulary which means socially unacceptable words are used almost as often as socially descriptive wordsFirst person plural pronouns account for about 1 of the words we say everyday When a bad word is bleeped it is covered with a 1 kilohertz sine wave which sounds like this Son of a  By the way the symbols andsquiggles that are used to represent a bad word have a nameTheyre called grawlixes They were named by Mort Walker in his seminal The Lexicon of Comicana He names a lot of things but most of them show stuff they dont hide stuff Why the need to hide bad words especially if we all pretty much know whats being saidWell there is no one single reason bad words are bad Steven Pinker in his excellent lectureon the topic delineates five types of swearingFirst of all some words are bad on purposeThey are created andor used with the intent to hurt othersHe calls this abusive swearing Using words to insult humiliate objectify or marginalise disfavoured people Now if that this disfavoured person is God were talking about supernatural swearing which was particularly taboo in Victorian times It was believed that casually or vainly referring to God would physically injure God himself literally So at the time people wereforced to come up with euphemisms like Zounds and Gadzooks which  originally meant Gods Wounds and Gods Hooks referring to the nails driven through the hands of Jesus Historically swear words oftencame from things we were afraid of things we perceived as dangerous stronger than us and mercurial Such as death disease and infirmity sex and sexually transmitted diseasesas well as body fluids germy gross effluvia Words for those gross things became grossand bad in and of themselves uncouth to speak But not all words for gross things are socially unacceptable which brings us to Pinkers second type of swearing  emphatic swearing Emphatic swearing is where thetabooness of bad words becomes quite practicalYou wouldnt usually use those words but when you really want to convey that your currentemotions matter more to you than proper social conduct you can use them Dysphemism A euphemism is kind acceptable wordthat allows you to talk about something unpleasant while simultaneously letting everyone know you totally get that its unpleasant and want to respect that For instance if you want to beprofessional you wouldnt say s You might say defecate If on the other handyou really want to drive home just how unpleasant the experience was dysphemisms can help out a lot It wasnt a bag of canine defecation you found on your front porch it was a s bag of hot dog sBoth of these words refer to pretty much the same thing but they have different levels ofsocial acceptability and thats very helpful It means word choice allows us to not only refer to things in the real world but also to how we feel about them If both these words had the same levelof social acceptance we might even have to find new badderwords so as not to lose the power language currently has to express emotion repulsion and disgust But when it comes to two wordsreferring to the same thing but with different levels of social acceptancewho decides which ones good and which ones badWell historically many of the bad words we use today are the result of class differences In medieval England the lowerclass Saxons spoke a Germanic tongue while the upperclass Normans spoke a language related to French and Latin English as we know it todaycontains many consequences of their differences The lower class worked with animals and from them we get animal names The upper class only ate the animals which is wherethe names of the meat come from Todays swear words are similarDefecation stems from fancy pants Latin whereas the less classy s is Germanic Theres also idiomatic swearing where nothing is being emphasized No dysphemism is meantinstead its an easygoing type of swearing that shows an atmosphere is casual Bad words can be usedwere all close here Its okay to swear were all cool Cathartic swearing is a bit different It gives us lalochezia the medical term for the relief swearing provides when youre in pain In the brain swearing seems to involve different regionsthan regular language which may explain why people withaphasia caused by brain damage struggle to comprehend or construct spoken words but yet are fluent at swearing Or why people with coprolalia control normal language just fine but involuntarily utter profanity an obscene words It turns out swearing may be centralized in the limbic system along with the motionsMany animals make automatic noises when in pain or threat to startle or intimidate attackers or to let others know whats going on In humans bad words are great for this purpose Their tabooness makes them specialPeople wouldnt use them otherwise so they are great alarms Swearing is changingSome bad words are being used more and more frequently Of the seven words GeorgeCarlin said you could never say on television Today every second 22 of them are sent out on Twitter So what will swearing look like in the future It probably wont go away altogether its too useful But the words we dont like will likely change History has shown that as diseasebecomes less scary and sex and the supernatural more personal words related to them become less taboo and more common whereas words that were common in the past are increasingly unpleasant Perhaps in the future spurt not by runaway political correctness but by wider knowledge words like schizo mental aspy or even depressed will take the square stage Or as John McWhorter venturedwords centered around class and the gap between opportunity and disadvantage will become more taboo Salt of the Earth trash chav pikey urban as a pejorative When McKay Hatch started a No Cussing Club at his school his campaign became thetarget of so many online jokes and insults for being lame or antifree speech On his book he literally subtitled his own name the most cyberbullied kid in the world People care about this stuffIs it censorship to tell us what we can and cannot say or is it a safety seal ensuring certaindysphemisms dont get worn down to a quotidian bluntness like every other word Or is that badness of bad words a boundary a moving boundary of we reject  sometimes arbitrary sometimes irrational but always movingin the direction of acceptance moving forward Crime and inequality have existed ever since they could But when NWA released areaction in the form of a song with bad word in the title F the Policethe Federal Bureau of Investigations released a statement against the songIt was the only time up until then and sincethe FBI has ever issued an official statement about a work of art Bad words have power If you wanna push for change youll need something to push If everythings fine nothings cool So bad words are the precipitate of a larger reaction  the process of us slowly becoming what we want to become Thats some deep s And as always  thanks for watching,126.13003095975232,certaindysphemisms,0.0,-1.0,Dd7dQh8u4Hc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7dQh8u4Hc
What Does Earth Look Like?,2013-11-12T00:07:57Z,10.8,15759177,310182,Hey Vsauce Michael here This point of light in the sky is Earth as seen from the surface of Mars And this is Earth as seen from Saturn Heres an image taken only 45000 kilometres away the famous Blue Marble But what does Earth really look like Well it depends on how you define look The word look comes fromthe old Breton word lagud mean eye the human eye And thats part of the problemImages like this are based on light humans can see But we dont see everythingTheres a fantastic episode of Radiolab that uses sound to illustrate just how different other creature visual spaces are from our our ownWhen we talk about the way something physically looks we are talking about the visual perception of emitted or reflected electromagnetic radiation Specifically visible light Light we perceive as red has a longer wavelength than blue or violetBut what if I crank the wavelength even shorter Does it stop being light No it just becomes light you cant see  ultraviolet Xrays gamma raysGoing the other way you get infrared microwaves and finally radio waves In principle the spectrum of possible electromagnetic wavelengths is infinite But even within the range of wavelengths we observe the breadth is breathtaking If the entire practical spectrum of wavelengths was laid out linearly from New York to Los Angelesthe visual portion we see would only be the size of 100 nanometers Small enough to slip through a surgical mask Point is when it comes to what their is to see our eyes miss out on lot For instance take a look a remote controlMany of  these things communicate with light of wavelengths we cant see but mobile phone cameras can Try this at home Push a button on aremote control and you wont see much but use a mobile phone camerato detect wavelengths you cant see and have them rendered visibleTheres a whole lot going on we miss out on Our night sky is full of frequencies we cant see with our eyes alone but Chromoscopenet allows you to extend your visionThis is the Milky Way as we see it the visible light it gives off But slide to see how it would look if our eyessensed other frequencies Of course we are having to representthese other frequencies with visible colours because evenelectromagnetic pretend time is bounded by our puny limits As for Earth if we only saw infraredfrequencies it might look something like this in our mindsUltraviolet and extreme ultraviolet vision would returnunrecognizable spheres With Xray vision auroras around thepoles would shine brightly and gamma ray vision would giveEarth a bright edge from highenergy electromagneticradiation hitting the atmosphere at a shallow angle So which view is correct Is there an absolute true appearance of the Earth We havent even started yet Look back at the Blue MarbleWhats with the tyranny  of north meaning up Perhaps its because we often equate up with better and many early map makers were fromNorth of the equator But upsidedown maps are equally true no matter how strange day may seem to usFunny enough the famous Blue Marble itself is aproduct of North equals up bias It didnt originally look like this The crew of Apollo 17 originally took it like this NASA rotated it to fit our traditional idea of up after the fact Heres a visual birth that comes fromthe US Naval Observatorys live animation of our planetYou can see exactly what parts are in its shadow at this very momentOther shadows fall on Earth as well like the Moons shadow Last week BadAstronomer shared thisimage The dark smudges on the left is actually the Moons shadow during a Solar Eclipse as seen from above EarthTheres another problem with the Blue Marble  its flat and the Earth is threedimensionalA  globe is the best way to represent the Earth but globes are difficult to carry aroundand even when displayed in two dimensions well you just cant see everything at once A flat map of the Earth is really convenient but requires projecting a globe onto something flat And a spheres surface cannot berepresented on a plane without distortionThe West Wing famously pointed out the limitations of flat maps Theres no such thing as a perfect flat map of the entire world Some maps are useful for somethings and other maps for other things but it is really fun to pick on the Mercator projection mainly because its so popular and iseven used by Google Maps mainly because its so easy to zoom in on It preserves shape decently well but suffers when it comes to area As Ive shown before Africa is huge Its area is so large theentire contiguous United States could fit inside of it along with all of China India Japan and much of Europe But on the Mercator projection scale near the poles is pretty wonky distorted which means Greenland appears to be as large as Africa even though in reality it is only 114th the size Theres more Check out Alaska and Brazil on aMercator projection They appear almost the same size but in reality Brazil is nearly five times bigger than Alaska Areas near the equator are minimized whereas areas closer to the poles are exaggerated To have fun with this problem play the Google Maps Mercator puzzle The red pieces arecountries projected outside of their usual locations Now what the heck is this weird shape Well lets pull it away fromthe North Pole where scale is distorted a lot and now its Australia You can see how the math behind mapprojections distort Earth by interacting with them on Jason Davies brilliant site Notice how smallGreenland appears on the Mercator projection when pulled down to the equator and how exaggerated it becomes when moved to the edge To be fair the Mercator projection is great for navigation If you want something that is more fairwhen it comes to area try the Gall–Peters Here landmasses are the right relative size but shape is sacrificed Everything looks a bit too narrow Enter the Mollweide This projection shows equal areas and is a bit more pleasant shapewise If you interrupt the Mollweide aroundthe oceans relative area is preserved and the shape of land masses becomes even more accurate When it comes to the shortestroute between two places on the surface of the Earth Gnomonic projections are really cool Every straight line journey taken onEarths surface is actually part of a great circle On Mercator projections actual straight line paths look curved But every straight line on a Gnomonic projection is also a straight line in real life  the shortest route If you want a compromise between shape and areayou might try the pleasant Winkel tripel which theNational Geographic Society has used for maps it produces since 1998 Or a beautiful butterfly map that could be a ball until itsflattened say under a pane of glass The Dymaxion map can unfold to show how nearly connected Earths landmasses are Its a great way to visualize human migration overtime Its quite impressive how far and wide humans have traveled on earthbut it remains a bit of a disappointment to realize just how narrow our slice of visual perception really is But dont feel badThis brings us to the story of Julian Bayliss Yes hello is this doctor Julian Bayliss ON THE PHONE Yes speaking Bayliss told me about howone day while using Google Earth he spotted some dark green vegetation It looked like a rain forestAn expedition was scheduled and it turned out to be just that  a rain forest we had previously never seen I asked him more So what have you found there ON THE PHONEThat day we found about 12 new species just from MabuSo we found about 3 snakes 2 chameleons and about 4 butterflies 2 new species of plants and weve only really just been into theforest edge So I read read a paper the other day a scientific paperThey estimate that theres maybe 8 million 85 million species in this worldbut weve only actually discovered 15 million or between 15 and 2 million So weve actually only discovered maybe one fist of everything thats living on this planet Wow our eyes only see a tiny fraction of what there is to see But within that tiny fraction there are still an enormous number of things left to findSo keep searching keep looking ON THE PHONEAnd as always thanks for watching,131.11111111111111,electromagneticradiation,0.0,1.0,2lR7s1Y6Zig,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR7s1Y6Zig
Cruel Bombs,2013-10-30T19:00:16Z,8.4,18845064,502963,Hey Vsauce Michael here Every cloud has a silver lining Except nuclear mushroom cloudswhich have a lining of Strontium90 Caesium137 and other radioactive isotopes Upon detonation atoms are literally gutted and glutton at temperatures exceedingthat of the surface of our SunIn the 1950s Harold Edgertons rapatronic camera caught nuclear fireballs less than a thousandth of a second after detonationUsing a special magnetic shutter each exposure lasted only a billionthof a second and captured an otherworldly creatureits energy vaporising the metal wires supporting its tower into stringing legs of plasma Watch the target on the groundNow roughly visualized here is a conventional TNT explosion Now on the same spot a similarly sized bomb that uses nuclear fission When Little Boy was detonated over Hiroshima only 138 of its uranium actually fissionedThe rest was blown away before that could happen which means asEric Schlosser points out the fission of merely 07 grams of uranium thats less than the weight ofa banknote was enough to kill 80000 people and destroy twothirds of citys buildings When a country hastens of thousands of nuclear weapons ready to go accidents are a possibility This was a problem during the Cold War and it still is a problem What if there is a fireor a miscommunication or a rogue officer decides to set one off Or what if someone just drops a warhead How much risk is too much I asked Schlosser The acceptable probability of a nuclear weapon accident What is it now The acceptable probability of the detonation of a nuclear weaponin an accident is one in a million In 2012 the odds of your dying in a commercial airliner accidentwere about one in forty million So thats even more remote thanthe accidental detonation of a nuclear weapon There have been oopsie daisy momentswith nuclear weapons on US soil Luckily none thatresulted in critical mass but accidents nonethelessJust like when you pee your pants except your pantsare the entire planet and the P stands for Plutonium Eureka comes from ancient Greek meaning I have found it And in Eureka North Carolina you can find it A giant sign that says Nuclear mishap On my birth date the year my father was borna US B52 bomber carrying two 4 megaton thermonuclear bombs over North Carolina tumbled from the sky A loose lanyard in thecockpit snagged the bomb release switchEach bomb contained a greater explosive yield than all munitions ever detonated by mankind combinedLieutenant Jack ReVell discovered that only one safety mechanism didnt fail that day A single low voltage arming switch remained untouched during the crashAnd that one switch is why he explained in 2011 we dont have a bay where North Carolina is today The bombs were recovered mostly The uraniumrich Secondaryof one of the bombs was never found To this day it remains buried underground in North CarolinaHeres something you can try at home Build a nuclear reactor In 1994 a 17yearold David Han attempted to build a nuclear reactor in his mothers backyard in Michigan It wasnt that difficult For instance common everyday smoke detectorscontain small amounts of radioactive AmericiumAnd old glow in the dark paint contains Radium His reactor neverreached critical mass but it did succeed in exposing his neighborhood to 1000 times the regular dosage of background radiation It was declared aSuperfund hazardous materials cleanup site and all of his work was confiscated byauthorities and buried in Utah It didnt end there In 2007 David Hahn was arrested for stealing smoke detectorsfrom an apartment building His face was covered with sores believedto be caused by constant exposure to radioactive materials Three days after Little Boy was droppedon Hiroshima by the Enola Gay Charles Sweeney was ordered to drop Fatman on Kokura He flew boxcar over the city for nearly an hour with the bomb bay doors openbut it was cloudy Sweeney couldnt achieve visualconfirmation of the target and was forced to go to the secondary target  Nagasaki where 75000 people died instead Kokura was spared because of the clouds We can build a weapon that mimics the furnace of our Sunand the winds of Neptune but yet we cant predict the weather more thana few minutes ahead of time During World War 2Japanese soldiers spot for their emperor in ways that made allied troops speechless Kamikaze planes and torpedoesdriven by a single pilot lost after use When outnumbered without hope Japanese soldiers werereported to have thrown themselves off clips or swam out to sea to drown rather than surrendered Even after two atomic bomb attacksthe Japanese Minister of War urged his people to continue fighting But on August 14th 1945 the Emperor of Japan overruled that decision and unconditionally surrendered Men had leapt of off cliffs for him but in his own words the enemy has for the first time used cruel bombs The heavy casualties are beyond measure Richard Feynman receivedthe Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 He also helped developthe first atomic bomb at Los AlamosIn The Meaning of It All he wrote Is science of any value And below thatI think a power to do something is of value He elaborates by talking about keys Everything we learned aboutthe universe everything we invent or discover within it is a key to the gates of heaven But the same key will also open the gates to hell The Titan II Missile is great for delivering lethal nuclear warheads But it also sent Gemini astronauts to space preparing us for a mission to the Moon Science doesnt tell us how to use keys It finds them or predicts them How we use keys is up to us And as always thanks for

Our Narrow Slice,2013-10-08T18:45:25Z,10.233333333333333,12219200,256995,Hey Vsauce Michael here This picture is about a year and a half oldBut the pyramids themselves are much older than thatHow much older Well think of it this way The Pyramids of Giza were as old to the ancient Romans as the ancient Romans are to usWhen the pyramids were being built there were woolly mammoths living on Wrangel Island Thats pretty oldBut dont get too impressed We often learn about the past in units separate chapters which distracts from the factthat many chapters arent just nearer each other than you might thinkthey are often literally written on top of one anotherAnne Frank and Martin Luther King Jr were bornin the exact same year By the late 1960s humans had come a long way Weve become a spacefaring speciesBut while we were sending the first probes to the Moon and Venus and Mars it was still illegal for a black personand a white person to marry in 16 statesThe guillotine seems like a macabre artefact from bygone days but it was last used by France toofficially behead a criminal the year Star Wars came outWhile General Custer was fighting native tribes on the American frontierthe Brooklyn Bridge was being buildAnd there were people alive then who would later watch the Moon landing on television We went from Custers last stand to Armstrongs first steps within the span of a single human life But all of these storiesfrom the pyramids to Julius Caesar to you watching this video right nowbelong to an incredibly thin section in the book of human historyCompared to what human life has mainly been like here on earth our current societies are weirdWeird is also an acronym used by Jared Diamond in his new bookThe World Until Yesterday Jared Diamond wroteGuns Germs and Steel Collapse and hes here with me to talk about weird Weird weird is an acronym for western educatedindustrial rich and democratic When we talk about human naturewere really talking about a narrow slice of societyTraditional societies were everybody in the worldfrom the beginning of human evolution 6 million years ago until within the last 10000 years for the first time we beganencountering strangers and then we developed writing and then we acquired kingsAll of these things that we take for granted are matter of the last 5000  10000 yearsOr the Internet or the media theyre a matterof the last few decades The relative recency of weird societiesin the speed with which information and knowledge increasesmeans that not that long ago we thought some pretty strange thingsFor instance in 1903 The New York Times predictedthat building a flying machine would be possible in 1 to 10 million years Later that very same yearthe Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk In 1908 it was said that no flying machine will ever fly from New York to ParisWho made that  foolish predictionOne of the Wright brothers In 1962 the Decca recording company passed on a young rock band sayingwe dont like their sound and guitar music is on the way outThe band in question was the Beatles Keith Moon and John Entwistle were said to have remarked about a band called The New Yardbirds that band so illconceived it will sink like a balloon or a zeppelin made out of lead Well Jimmy Page was not deterredIn fact he took that phrase and made it his bands new nameHe removed the A so it wouldnt be pronounced lead and thats where we got Led Zeppelin There is evidence the Nazis werent entirely convinced Earth was a globe we lived on the outside of Instead they figured the Earthscontinents were actually aligning on the inside of a hollow concave surfacewith the stars and moon and planets in the middle Seriously As the story goes Doctor Heinz Fischerwas sent to Rügen Island to spy on the BritishNow the curvature of the earth would have made this impossible But thinking the earth was shaped likethis they pointed their telescopes up at a 45 degree angle Needless to say the experiment didnt workThe Eiffel Towers inauguration and the Wall Street Journaland Starry Night and CocaCola and Nintendo and Adolf Hitler all began in 1889 As did a guy named Thomas Midgley Jr Celebrated in his time Midgleys legacy has since been tarnished by the negative consequences of his inventions His list of contributions to society is impressively disastrous In the late twenties Midgley synthesizedthe first chlorofluorocarbons  CFC  for which he wonthe Society of Chemical Industrys Perkin medalOnly later did we realize all of those tons of CFCs we were emitting were eating away 4 of ouratmospheres protective ozone layer every decade Like a virus creating a wound unlikely to completely heal until me and you have long been dead In the early 1920s Midgley discovered that by adding Tetraethyllead to gasoline engine knocking could be reduced The American Chemical Society gave himthe 1923 Nichols medal for the discovery There were other saferalternatives but General Motors jointly owned a patent on Tetraethyllead with MidgleyThey could make a profit on it so they advertised it as the best option and almost immediately nearly every motor vehicle on earth was spewing lead into our atmosphere and soil which put it in our blood lead poisoning for decades Currently the reference for healthy children is a blood lead content of less than 5 micrograms per decilitre After the popularization of Midgleys leaded gasoline 88 of children in America had double that amount of lead in their bloodWhen leaded gasoline was finally phased out in the 1970s that percentage fell to 9 Lead is a neuro toxin Even light exposurelike that caused by Midgleys invention can cause a decrease in intelligence and in increase in antisocial behaviourFordham University found that in young adults the best predictor of delinquent and violent behavior is literally the lead content of their bloodChillingly the rise and fall of violent crimes by juveniles in the 20th century tracks significantly closely with therise and fall of lead in their blood when they werepreschoolers  all over the world Historian J R McNeill remarked that Midgley had more impact on the atmospherethan any other single organism in Earths historyMidgleys final invention was even worse Well for him In 1940 he contracted polioTo help his friends and family lift him from bed he designed an intricate system of ropes and pulleys As was the story of his life the invention seemed brilliant at first but four years later he became accidentally entangled in the ropesand his own invention strangled him to death Midgleys life took up 055 of human historyAnd roughly speaking yours will too To put that in perspective lets time travel starting right nowWe begin 100000 years ago  the beginning of modern humans We are moving forward in time an entire millennia a thousand years every secondAs you can see not much is changingOur modern world will briefly flash at the endThats all it is Thats all its been So be careful not to miss it And as

How People Disappear,2013-09-25T17:21:25Z,13.383333333333333,20712184,697469,Hey Vsauce Michael here A few years ago in Minneapolis an angry dad stormedinto the retail store TargetHis daughter a high schooler had been receiving coupons in the mailfrom the store for things like cribs and diapersWas Target encouraging his daughter a minor to go out and get pregnantwell Well the store apologized but a few dayslater they heard back from the father He told them a few things have been going on in my household I was unaware of My daughter is due in August I owe you an apologyYou see Targets internal algorithms have been tracking and processing his daughters purchases and recently shed started buying different items than usual Things like certain vitamin supplementsand scentfree soaps and lotions Behaviors the system flagged as evidence she could be pregnant thus they her sent the coupons And they were rightWithout being told Target knew that a girl was pregnant before her own father We are tracked and followed digitally now more than ever beforeWe live in a world of 247 CCTV browser cookies trackable debit cardsand cell phones and GPS fingerprinting and DNA analysisBut despite all of that every single year in the United States alone more than 2000 people disappear and are never found again dead or alive Where do missing people goHow did they disappear What if you disappeared and how do you know you havent already disappearedIn many cases missing persons are the victims of unsolved or unknown crimes They may have suffered accidentsor taken their own lives and their bodies were never foundOr they may be perfectly fine and have simply escaped their old life old friends andfamily old debt and obligations to start a new life somewhere else possibly as someone else How long would it take for people to notice if you disappearedWell think about it I mean it sort of depends on who you are how you live and how you disappearedIn most jurisdictions after about five to seven years if no one has heard anything from you at all you can be declared dead in absentia This is what happened to French astronomer Guillaume Le GentilIn the 18th century hundredsof people traveled far and wide to observe the transit of Venus from different locations on earth They knew that by comparing theirmeasurements they could calculate more accurately than ever before just how far away the Sun wasSo Le Gentil left Paris in 1760 for Pondicherry in IndiaBut after a storm blew him off course and the British occupied Pondicherryhe was forced to spend the day of the transit on a boat at sea which rocked too much for accurate measurements to be takenNow the next transit would happen in 8 yearsBut after that the next next transit wouldnt happen for another 100 years So he stuck around He didnt return to ParisInstead he built an observatory and waitedWhen he finally returned to Paris 11 years after leavinghe found that he had been declared deadHis wife had remarried his family had plundered his belongings and his position at the Royal Academy of Scienceshad been given to someone else He never did see the transit of Venus by the wayOn the day that it happened the sky above him was overcast We know the human population of Earth Kind of Population figures and counters are only estimations Individuals are best accounted for by real people in their real livesBut that doesnt always happen Earlier this year Janet Vealpassed away in her apartment in Ringwood HampshireLarge portions of her body were eaten by her pet cats before she was discovered weeks laterAnd seven years ago Joyce Carol Vincent was found dead on her sofa in Wood Green or at least her skeleton was foundShed been dead for at least three years and no one ever checked on her Her television was still on And four days after Timothy McVeigh bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City taking 168 lives a severed left leg was found in the rubble No one knew who it belonged toThe legs of all the other victims had been accounted for and no one else had been reported missing DNA analysis showed that the legbelonged to a Lakesha Levy but she had already been buried with both her legs So they dug up her corpse Shed been buried with someone elses left leg The legs were swapped but because her body had been embalmed DNA in the unknown leg could not be analyzed To this day no one knows who that leg belongs to The 169th victim remains a mystery Some conspiracy theorists argue thatthe leg may have belonged to be actual bombersomeone besides Timothy McVeigh who was close enough to the explosionto be obliterated completely except for one legRegardless what it does show is that it is possiblefor a person to disappear without anyone ever asking where they went Sometimes people are reported dead or missing even when they arentPremature obituaries are commonMany living people already have one on file If a famous person dies the media television newspapers magazines well they need a full story as soon as possibleSo they prepare them ahead of time locked awayleaving only the dates and circumstances of the death to be filled in Makes sense but its awkward when they leak before the persons deadIn 2003 CNNs website accidentally carried draftobituaries for living people that could be accessedIts embarrassing but for the person reading their ownobituary its a chance to do something that most of us never get a chance to do See how you will be remembered after youre gone Alfred Nobel invented dynamite He made a fortune manufacturing and selling deadly weapons  cannons and armamentsIn 1888 his brother Ludvig died but manynewspapers mistakenly thought that he had died and published obituaries for Alfred NobelThey werent very flattering One French paper declared The merchant of death is deadNobel read these obituaries and was so ashamed bywhat his legacy apparently was going to beWhen he did die he left almost all of his money to the cause of celebrating humanity He created The Nobel PrizeMarcus Garvey wasnt so luckyThe story goes that after suffering a stroke newspapers ran premature obituaries that were critical of him saying he died broke alone and unpopularShocked by how negatively he was being remembered Garvey suffered another stroke whilereading his own obituary and diedIn April of 2006 five Taylor University students diedin a tragic car accident Another student survived but was in a coma She was identified as Laura van Ryn Her friend Whitney Cerak wasnt as luckyShe was pronounced deadA thousand people attended her funeral but over the next few days as Laura recovered she began speakingand when asked her name Laura said my name is WhitneyThe girls looked similarIt turned out Laura was the one they had buriedLater Whitney was married in the very same church that years before had held her funeralWhat if you are already missing and just dont know itIts not known how often hospitals accidentally switch babies at birth Modern hospital policies make itunlikely to happen but because we dont all go out and get maternity and paternity tests for funthere isnt a lot of data on the phenomenon But it does happenIts often discovered because of DNA tests administered to resolve child support disputes Or in the case of the 35yearold womanin the Canary Islands its because in 2001 an employee at astore youre shopping at mistakes you for her best friend  because you look exactly like her because she is your longlost twin separated from you since birthAnd the sister you grew up with thinking was your twin turns out to be a biological strangerWhat if you are missing but the authorities dont know Such is the life of the unreported missingPeople in a country illegally people estranged from their family and friends with no missing person report ever being filed children of homeless mothersThese people arent just missing they are what is known as missing missing The FBIs National CrimeInformation Database contains approximately 50000 reported missing children but Outpost For Hope reports thatthere are more than a million children in America who are missing without anyone knowing theyre missingIt is not against the law to go missing under your own volition You might have debts to pay or contracts to honor but if you are an adult the act of disappearing is not illegal in and of itselfYou have the right to go missingBut believing that no one would miss you That is ridiculous and unscientificStatistics would suggest otherwiseDavid Wong wrote one of the most powerful articles Ive ever read There is a lot of information out thereTheres even a word for it  infobesity It takes a lifetime to even experience some of itIts easy to think  that everyone knows everything that you knowBut every year more than 100 million new people areborn and not a single one of them is born knowing that they are made out of atoms or that black holes are awesomeSomeone needs to be there to tell them to show them How many jokes do you hear every day every weekHow many jokes do you hear every yearHeres a fun thought By considering average life expectancy and the typical number of jokesa person hears in a year David Wong posited a thought rough in its approximation but sharp in its essence If you are under the age of 38 odds are the funniest joke you will ever hear is a jokeyou havent even heard yet And if you are over the age of 38 odds are you already know a joke thatto more people than you could ever possibly meet might be the funniest jokethey will ever hear So wherever you are were glad you there And as always thanks for

last words,2013-09-02T14:56:30Z,8.366666666666667,13348004,295278,Hey Vsauce Michael here On December 17th 1977 Gary Gilmore was executed for murder He was the first prisoner executedby the United States after a 10year suspension of the practiceWhen asked if he had any last words he simply repliedlets do it Years later advertising executive Dan Wiedenadapted those words into a slogan that is now more widely known than Gary GilmoreLast words are powerfulThey are the final statement a persons entire life has been leading up to One last chance to go on recordbefore obliteration We dont know Albert Einsteins last wordsHe spoke them in German to a nurse who only knew English Theyre lost But what will be our first wordsThe first words from earth extraterrestrials out theremight hear from us We have been broadcasting signalswith radio waves wirelessly through the air for more thanone hundred years Under the right conditionsthose signals can leak into space and keep going outward at the speed of light through our galaxy through the universeCurrent human technology would struggle to tune into regular TV and radio broadcasts from as near as MarsBut perhaps other intelligent beings out there would fare better and could point thereinstruments at earth and hear usIf so what would the earliest thing be that they could receive Our cosmic first wordsWell the earliest signal robust enough to bepicked up light years away might have come from Hitler His 1936 broadcasting of the Summer Olympics used powerfulenough radio equipment to reach fortyone countries making it a contender for what listeningextraterrestrials could receive as to them Earths first words Within the last 50 years or so broadcast signals in general have become strongerthan Hitlers Olympics and are better candidates for being intercepted The earliest of them have traveled50 light years away from Earth Altogether they have entertained billions of people and by now about 2000 stars The 133 brightest of which are shown hereSo far Martin Luther King JRs I have a dream speechhas traveled as far as the furthest on the diagram µAra which has four known planetsIn six years our first words on the Moonwill pass by µAras systemThats one small step for man one giant leap for mankindThose words were spoken by Neil Armstrongseen here a few years before his death with Eugene Cernanthe most recent and currently last man to have walked on the surface of the Moon On December 14th 1972 before climbing back into the lunar moduleCernan spoke our as of today last words on the Moon We leave as we came and God willing as we shall return with peace and hope for all mankindOf course once inside the lunar module the crew kept talking meaning that technicallythe very last words humans have said on the surface of the Moon were acountdown spoken by Harrison Jack SchmittThree two one We havent been back to the Moon sinceBut hold on What were the first words spoken on the surface of the Moon reallyArmstrongs giant leap statement is a good answerbut what counts as being on the Moon if touchdown counts Then the first words spoken on theMoon go not to Armstrong but to Buzz Aldrin who on feeling at least one of the landing pads softly settle onto the lunar soil spoke this immortal descriptioncontact light We are pumping broadcasts in the space as an ever expanding sphere of radio waves But heres something humblingEven while growing at the speed of light Earths radio sphere is puny This is our galaxy the Milky WayComparatively the distance our radio signals our voice has traveled is this big The universe is huge How the heck are you supposedto be remembered in it Utter last words that stick around after you die Well you may have heardthe famous quote from Banksy They say you die twice One time when you stop breathing and a second time a bit later on when somebody says your name for the last timeBut your anonymous influence continues long after that rightI mean people may stop saying your name but for instance if you have kids and they have kids and so on and so on you continue on in a wayMaybe just genetically not by name Well people have triedThe world record for most children passedout of one single woman belongs to Mrs Feodor VassilyevShe had 16 pairs of twins 7 sets of triplets and 4 sets of quadruplets for a grand total of 69 childrenAs for being a biological father that takes less timeThe documented record for most children fathered by one man is held by Ismail Ibn Sharif who is estimated to have had more than 900 children with multiple women But children—or not—in a feedback system like earth or life causeandeffect are complicated and never ending Remember the double pendulumsfrom this video A small difference in the initial conditions of a systemcan lead to enormously  different outcomes laterOn Tuesday Im flying from London to Los AngelesThe plane will be flown by pilots who can steer it toward the correct runway in the United States but if the airplane needed to be aimed from London and sent on a straight shot now things would need to be very specific Misaiming just one degree to the left at the beginning would sendthe plane not to Los Angeles but nearly 160 kilometres southto Tijuana Mexico Your name and your last words mighteventually be forgotten but your status as an initial condition for the universes future is already happening Bach died before he could complete The Art of FugueThe peace ends abruptly during Contrapunctus XIVSo composers continue reconstructing itFor that reason it is uniquely aliveSpeaking new

Why Do We Clap?,2013-08-25T20:08:26Z,10.5,7741015,214011,Hey Vsauce Michael here The loudest clapever recorded clocked in at 113 decibels And the world record forfastest clapping was recently set at 802 claps per minuteClapping is the most common human body noise others are meant to hearthat doesnt involve the vocal cords Its a great builtin percussion instrument But clapping has also become acollective social gesture that we use in groups to express admiration approvalEspecially for things that happen on stage So here I am on stageBut to show approval to show that they like things why do humans clapAmazing question When applauding a person creates claps at a rate of about 255 claps per second Kinetic energy from the hands isconverted into acoustic energy mainly within the 2200 to 2800 hertz range the frequencies clap on clap off devices detectBut many other frequencies are created during a single clapAnd different hand positions create different spectra of frequencies most of which are notwhole number multiples of each other which is why a clap cant make a musical noteA discernible definite pitch the way a clarinet or piano or the human voice can If vocalisations can be so finely controlled why clapI mean its such a crude messy noiseWell at a fundamental and physiological level the impulse to clap may have originated as a reaction to an overflowing of enthusiasm an immediate and primitive reaction to excitementSteven Connor colourfully puts it this way If the distinctive sound of the human is the sound of language then sound producedfrom other places than the mouth always has the taint of the gratuitous  the excessive or the proscribed Clapping is the benign superflux of the bodythe diarrhoea of soundHe calls it a spilling over of feelingA burst of energy unfiltered by language or thoughtIts a way to burn off extra enthusiasm but if clapping is so natural and involuntary to the individualhow did it become coded into western etiquette An expected behavior yousometimes feel pressured to do even if you dont want toDesmond Morris called modern clapping patting a performer on the back from a distanceAnd other theories have called clapping high fiving yourself for something someone else has doneBut in its current form there is another thing besides yourself and the performancethat might be truly driving applauseA super organism called The Crowd A study published in theJournal of the Royal Society found that an individuals contribution to applauseseems to have less to do with their actual opinion as to the quality of theperformance and has more to do with the behavior of the collective group the anonymousGroup voice aspect of applause also makes sense when you considerthe fact that clapping is a great equalizer Studies have shown that asopposed to vocalizations which can betray a lot about the people who make themsubjects cannot guess better than chance whether the clap they hearis from a man or a woman nor can they guess the sizeof the individual based solely on the sound of their clapClapping may have become the standard nonverbalgesture of admiration because it is arguably the loudest the easiestand the most democratic Performers cant here a thumbsup or a winkNot everyone can snap their fingers and clapping is less disruptive than stomping feet or waving around big objectsMoreover historically authorities have encouraged clappingIn the sixth century BC Cleisthenes came to power in AncientGreece as a democratic reformer and made behaviors like clapping a civic duty the proper way for the masses to express admiration for their leaderThere wasnt enough time for everyone to meet and greet his or her leader but they could all greet their leader together as one super organism with one voice  applauseBy the early 19th century the desire to code appropriate group reactions and encourage them by example was quite official Agencies offered claques for hire professional applauders who would memorize operas attend them like normal opera goers and clap cry or laugh at appropriate times so that the actual audience would know when to properly do whatIts interesting that five or six months after being born human babiesbegin to realize that their hands can work togetherClapping is a natural reaction to this realization but parenting books have to advise parents to teach their children to connect clapping with group happiness and celebrationThe connection itself not being inevitableTo this day applause signs reinforce audiencebehavior simply because those with the authority are requesting itNot because it is a natural reactionbut because it can be and historically has been socially imposed So whats the future of applaudsWell last week I hung out with the guys from Grand Illusions really fascinating channelAnd they pointed out something strange How many times have you listenedto your favorite song Probably quite a few rightYouve listened to songs you dont like plenty of timesBut as recently as a 150 year ago people only heard their favorite symphony maybe two or three times in their entire lifeIf you wanted music you had to go to a concert or pick up an instrument or singThere was no other wayBut now because of recorded music MP3 players and phones and tablets andpersonal computers and digital libraries allow us to be an audience of one An audience all by ourselvesnot just when professionals get together and draw a crownIn the 1990s Faith Popcorn gave this broader phenomenon a name cocooningThe Internet home entertainment cell phones alarm systems selfcheckout filters for our personal air and water are all paraphernalia of cocooning A tendency toward more lonelysolitary experiences in the last 30 yearsIn my episode about the friend zone I talk about how cocooning might be making friendship meeting new peopleand new unexpected ideas a veining experience But applause is safe rightI mean applause isnt about meeting new people its about becoming them Becoming a super organismthat speaks with one unindividuated roarAnd concerts and live performances are still big parts of our livesBut whats fascinating is that more entertainment is more available than ever beforeAnd despite being TV shows movies games and music this new entertainment is increasingly consumed like booksIn solitude aloneYou dont need to applaud alone in a cocoon but to be surealone on the Internet we dont applaud but we do like and share and favorite and retweet Those actions might be a sort of ersatz applauseIn real life your clap is lost in the crowdaggregated into the total sound And online so are your likes and favorites They join a collective gesture as a sort of digital applause A pessimist might feellike these new collective gestures are hollow lonely a sad replacement for actual social experiencesBut whats really happening Because a like is not necessarily lonelyA retweet by its very nature isnt a clap lost in the crowd its a clap that joins the crowd but is also traceable directly back to you Maybe cocooning maybe the rise of applause substitutes like digital applause is something to be worried about or maybe its thenatural result of having so many applauseworthy things just a few clicks away We cant applaud all of themso we have evolved more scaleable reactions which incidentally are more personal instead of being pathetic clicks from an increasingly isolated cocooned population Digital applause might be like somethingelse that comes from cocoons and having more of themSomething beautiful Butterflies And as always thanks for

Why Do We Get Bored?,2013-08-19T03:30:47Z,12.416666666666666,12065960,350352,Hey Vsauce Michael here Action and danger is exciting but this is a fake gun and the process of enlarging a holelike the barrel of a gun is called boring Boring Boring a hole is a slow process requiring repetitivemovements from a tool that goes in circles which may be why things that are slowand repetitive and dont appear to be going anywhere came to be described with the same wordTheyre boring But why do we get bored and why does it matterEvidence of being temporarily uninterested in anythinghappening  boredom  has been found as far back as ancient Pompeii Boredom is a feeling we dont like Its uncomfortable but its trivial rightI mean boredom happens to all of us but now we have Facebook and Twitter and YouTubeand texting and Candy Crush to keep ourselves occupiedSo really who caresWell heres the thing Physical pain heartbreak and nausea are also uncomfortable but theyre caused by dangerous serious toxic things whereas boredom occurs when you are merely disinterestedin the outside world and the inner world of your thoughtswhen you are alone with just yourselfSo does the existence of boredom mean thatwhen it really comes down to it life itself existing isnt really enough Arthur Schopenhauer said that if life possessed in itself a positive value in real content there would be no such thing as boredomMere existence would fulfil and satisfied usBut apparently it doesnt because boredom existsIs something wrong with being or is something awesome about usNearly 200 hundred years agoGiacomo Leopardi wrote in a letter to his father boredom is the most sublime of all humanemotions because it expresses the fact that the humanspirit in a certain sense is greater than the entire universeBoredom is an expression of a profound despairand not finding anything that can satisfy the souls boundless needsSo while superficially boredom might seem trivial or childish embarrassing almost rude to admit to feeling one things for sure  boredom isnt boringWhen bored your brain activity only drops about 5 and magneticresonance images of peoples brains while they were bored actually showedgreater activity in regions responsible for recalling autobiographical memory conceiving the thoughts and feelings of others andconjuring hypothetical events  imaginingJennifer Schuessler wrote about this in her appropriately titled essay Our boredom OurselvesShe points out that in line with neurological evidence boredom historically has beenan important source of creativity wellbeing and our very sense self Its an imposed state that leaves us to think about ourselves notice thingswe may have overlooked and get ancy enough to take productive actions we might have otherwise put off like cleaning writing or challenging the mind with puzzles and games As a pressure to move boredom may have driven us to accomplish much ofwhat we have achieved But how do you measure boredomThe boredom proneness scale BPS assess an individuals propensity for getting bored in a sense their ease of being attentiveAverage scores range between 81 and 117 We can take scores on the BPS and correlate them with other thingsFor instance people who know themselves well can easily label their feelingshave high levels of selfawareness tend to have a lower propensity score feeling bored But when it comes to feeling boredom frequently the culprit may be ones own physiology Individuals with fewer dopaminereceptors in the brain tend to need more excitement to stay stimulated meaning chronic boredom may be a symptom of the way your body isA symptom that if left unchecked can become something worse Anna Gosline lists depression anxiety drug addiction alcoholism hostility poor social skills bad grades and low work performance In fact the National Center on drugabuse and addiction has reported that the top three risk factors for teenage substance abuse are too much stress too much spending money and too much boredomThe Beth Israel Medical Center in New York reports that addicts reported levels of boredom are the only reliable indicator ofwhether or not they will stay clean Our brains need stimulation in order to be healthy not so much thattheyre overwhelmed but a perfect balance unique to each individualunder which they can perform optimally with energized focuswhat psychologists call flowToo little stimulation and our brains will act out hoping to find some somewhere to preventsomething worse from happeningOur brains have thaasophobia the fear of boredomPeter Tooheys Boredom A Lively History quotes Norman Doidges findings that nothing speeds brain atrophy more being immobilized in the same environment the monotony undermines our dopamine and attentionalsystems crucial for maintaining brain plasticityVariety and stimulation encourage neurogenesisnew brain cells and can extend the lives of cells thatalready exist in certain regions of the brainIn order to avoid a lack of stimulation our brains will even try to make uptheir own stimulations  hallucinationsHallucinations can be induced in almost anyones brainif there isnt enough stimulation aroundFor instance the ganzfeld effect When exposed to random noise andunchanging monochromatic field the brain freaks out and startsgenerating hallucinations The effect can also be induced withping pong balls hemispheres over the eyes and a radio tuned to static Extended sensory deprivation in a special chamber that eliminates site sound smell tasteand tactile sensations by floating the body in a special fluidto reduce the sensation of weight can also cause hallucinations as well as anxietyWhen denied proper stimulation the brain goes through phases that beginwith boredom and if left unchecked can become worse Its a phenomenon welldocumented inanimals confined to cages for long periods of time andin a horrific case a human child named GenieBorn in 1957 in Arcadia California Genie became one of the most famouscases of abnormal child psychologyHer father was abusive to her and her family and delusional He hated the outsideworld and sought to isolate his family from it as best he couldHe confined Genie to a room with only two blackedoutwindows for the first thirteen years of her lifeHe often tied her to a toilet chair and never fed her solid foodWhen authorities finally found her in 1970 she had not acquired a language and had the mental age of an 18monthold child Genie was extensively studied and became a staple of psychology courses a rare example ofan impossible experimentWhat if a human child was isolated from human contact social behaviors and human languageA feral child not raised by the proverbial wolves but instead right in the middle of suburbiaGenie is still alive today her identity anonymous as a ward of the state of CaliforniaExtended under stimulation isnt just apunishment inflicted by delusional caretakers its also a punishment inflicted on criminals especially in the form a solitary confinement In the Bureau of Prisons the record for most time spent denied social contact is held and still being set by Thomas Silverstein Considered extremely dangerousSilverstein has been kept in solitude since 1983He has barely seen a single other human for the last 29 years Stories like those are intense and are far beyond everyday occasional boredom simple boredomWhat you feel when waiting at an airport or listening to anunengaging lecture is not a disorder its not a moodm its an emotion Robert Plutchikswheel of emotions is a great way to visualize this The wheel is based on 8 basic emotions extended in order of intensityBoredom is positioned as a light version of disgustEmotions are not superfluousNormal amounts of them have a purpose Creatures who feel emotions are oftencompelled to do and not do more complicated things than merely eating drinking sleeping and procreating like building friendships apologizingloving unconditionally and planning and building for the futureDisgust is an emotion we dont likeIt keeps us from doing things Its purpose is most likely a warning an alarm triggeredby things that appear rancid spoiled or toxic that could poison us or make us sick Like a good friend disgust pushes usaway from such things It guides us in a healthy directionLikewise boredom protects usMonotonous speakers mindnumbing tasks and overloaded sameness those things arent dirty or poisonoustheyre just not stimulating enoughBoredom compels us to new things fresh stimulation and when it cant be overcome a propensity to boredom is a sign of a healthy mind Its advantageousCreatures who felt it wound up doing more flourished more which led tomore creatures like themselves boredness feelersSo the next time youre a little bored be proud Thank your ancestorsyou are participating in a life improving drive like hunger or thirst that pushes us toward new and better things Give yourself time away from the usual distractions to get boredIt will be boring but boring is literally how holes get made and perfectedNot all holes are useful but some become peoples to some pretty cool stuff And as always thanks for

INSIDE a Spherical Mirror,2013-08-09T22:46:36Z,7.233333333333333,14865589,303881,Hey Vsauce Michael hereBut you are actually right thereWell at least the camera isMirrors are amazing In fact the word mirror comes from Latin mirari meaning to wonder at to admire Its also where we get the word miracleMirror acle Like when mirrors face each otherand transform a toilet room into infinityI love this kind of stuff But what if instead of a rectangular prism the room was a sphere mirrored all the way aroundWhat would it look like What would you see floating around insuch a room The first question we should ask involves the light source If you were in this roomusing a flashlight and you turned the flashlight off would the light keep bouncing around off ofthe mirrored walls illuminating the room until your bodyabsorbed all of it Or if you left the flashlight onwould light continue bouncing around building up gettingbrighter and brighter until you lost your vision and cooked Probably notEvery time light hits a mirror and reflects offa tiny tiny amount is absorbed Even if your mirrorspherical room was the size of a giant stadium and its walls reflected 9999 of light on each reflection light speed is just too fast meaning that the reflections will happenrapidly a little bit of light being lost each time The room will go dark in a fraction ofa fraction of a second To you and me it would seem instantaneousAs for what it would look like lets pretend you begin with your faceup against a wall of the sphere and float backwardtoward and past the centre At first you would see your face quite clearly The surrounding reflections would bevery distorted As you moved away at a certain point your face would ceaseto shrink away in appear smaller in mirror and instead would grow largerand become magnified until you reach the center at whichpoint your face would fill your field of view As you continued on pastthe center your image would flip upside down and continue receding away It would look a bit like thisBut dont get too enamoured with your reflection because mirrorsdont show you as you really are Have you ever wondered why you liked theway you look in a mirror but dont like how you look inphotographs or videoIt might be because of the mereexposure effectYou prefer what you are used to and most mirrors you look into dont show the real you the you that other people in cameras seeInstead a mirror shows you a reversed version of yourself and youve becomemore comfortable with that version of youA version of you that is flipped left to right Mirrors reverse along axes perpendicularto their surfaces like left and right They dont also flipthings upside down they dont also reverse up and down because those directions are parallel to the surface of the mirrorWhen it comes to the way you and other people look the difference can be startling NPR pointed out that Abraham Lincoln looked like thisMirrored he would have looked like this Now to us something seemsnoticeably strange about it but it is the Lincoln Lincoln would have preferredIts what he saw every day in the mirrorBut heres something really cool You can take a flexible mirror and unreverse its image by folding the mirror into a cylindrical shapeTake a look at this Here I am with a reflective material and there is the camera with some text taped underneathas you can see everything is flipped left to rightBut as I fold the sheet into a cylindrical shape the image separates revealing an unreversed versionIt becomes a true mirror Finally here is one last piece of every day mirror trickeryWhen you look into a mirror how big is your reflection your image on the surface of the mirror to youSurely it depends on how far away you are from the mirrorBut it doesnt When you look into a mirror yourreflection on the surface of that mirror is always the exact same sizeIn fact it is always about half of your actual sizeThis is because when light reflects off a mirrorit comes in and reflects back out at the same anglewhich means that in order to reach your eyes at the top of your body light from your feet at the bottom must hit the mirror halfway between the twoThe triangles you form with a mirror are similar regardless of where you standYou can demonstrate this effect by outlining the size of your own head asit appears on the surface of a mirror using a bar of soapNow because you arent here lets pretend that this phone is yourhead and its camera is your eyeWe begin up close The camera looks really big from this perspectiveLet me just carefully trace around the outsideso we can compare later Good good good OkayNow Im going to pull away from the mirror Clearly the phone is smaller rightWell if I reach out and once again carefullytrace the edges There we goI will find that I have drawn a rectangle that is the exact same size Your image on the surface of a mirror from your own perspective is always thesame size whether you are a few centimeters away from the mirror or a few kilometres awayYour image on the surface of a mirror in fact is always half your actual size Okay enough about light returning to our eyesWhat about light that never returns Could we use a telescope to resolve individual aliens on a planet light years awayWell over on Vsauce3 Jake investigates this question with Star Wars And my friend Rusty investigates thepotential for Star Wars becoming real in his episode of Science FrictionAnd Vsauce2 has a brand new lüt all about cool Star Wars stuffCheck them all out And as always thanks for watching

What Will We Miss?,2013-07-28T21:22:24Z,9.816666666666666,32891738,797502,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd the year 6009 will be the very first year since 1961 that a year when written in HinduArabic numerals can be inverted and still look the sameBut you and I probably wont live long enough to enjoythe year six thousand and nineHuman lives just arent long enough We will miss out on thatWhat other cool future offense will we be missingWell first of all you and I will probably be gone beforethe completion of the time pyramid in Wemding GermanyIt will eventually be a pile of 120 concrete blocksBut the builders are only adding one block every 10 years Since beginning in 1993 theyve added only the first threeAt this rate the pyramid will be completed in the year 3183 The final block placed by our great great great great great greatmore than 30 greats grandchildrenBut even they will miss an opportunity to frolic and play safelyin the Chernobyl Exclusion ZoneThe zone of alienation where radioactivecontamination from the 1986 disaster will remain at levels too high for safe human activity until not the year 4000 not the 5000 not the 6000It will finally be safe probably in the year 22 000 Possibly within our lifetimesbut definitely within the next one million years stars like Betelgeuse and Eta Carinae will explode in brilliant supernovas visible from earth Im bummed Improbably going to miss out on these events because for a few weeks it will look almost as if earth has two Suns Despite being hundredsthousands of lightyears away their supernovas will shine brighterthan the full Moon at night and be visible even during daytime But the real sky show comes in 375 billion yearsOur galaxy is full of stars viewed from the surface of the earth they look like little drops of milk in the sky which is why we call it the Milky Way Galaxy But all galaxies are named after milk Milk lactose lactic galactic galaxies And every drop of milk in the skyevery star that you can see is inside our galaxy the Milky Way But theres a blurry distant shape This oneIts not a star its not a cloud of gas in our galaxy it is an entirely different Galaxy  the Andromeda Galaxy and its twoandahalf million light years away from our ownIt contains twice as many stars as the Milky Way and it is coming our wayHeaded toward us at 300 kilometres a second faster than a bulletRight now the sky looks like this In 2 billion years Andromedawill have approached so closely that people will look up at the sky and see thisIn 375 billion years the night sky will be like a scene from a science fiction movie oran awesome desktop wallpaper Incredible and kind of scary After this scene the sky will literallybe glowing with the birth of new stars as the Milky Way and Andromeda collidemixing up into a brilliant cosmic tiedye This simulation shows howAndromeda might collide with the Milky Way but keep in mind that you are watching billions of years pass every secondThese galaxies are moving fast but theyre also huge and covering even huger distancesThey will collide in the future but within the briefness of a single human life they appear almost frozen unmovingA couple billion years after colliding the course of both galaxies will bemarried together in a bright glowing centreEarth now a stepchild to what was once Andromeda part of a new bigger family called Milkdromeda It would be so cool to bealive to see our galaxy colliding with anotherBut dont get all fomo consumed by a fear of missing out Because whatever life is around thenwill have plenty to envy us for They may have spectacular nightly viewsbut secretly wish theyd been born in our time to experience say the beginning of the Internet They will actually miss out on a lot of things Because the Moon moves one centimetrefurther away from earth every year 600 million years from today the Moon will no longer be close enoughto earth to completely block out the Sun Future humans or descendants of humanswill therefore miss out on a chance to ever see for themselves the beauty of the total solar eclipsefrom the surface of Earth Long before earth dries up Niagara Falls will dry upWell not the water part but the falls part Every year the rushing water of Niagaraerodes the rock at the top of the falls one foot backwardBy the year 52 000 it will have eroded all the way toLake Erie and our progeny will have no Niagara Falls to enjoyGranite has an erosion rate of about one inch per ten thousand years So certainly by the year 7 million Mount Rushmore especially its faces will no longer existAnd because they slowly get pulled in or rejected into spacein 50 to 100 million years Saturn will no longer have its lovely rings So life on earth in the future might have awesome supernovas andgalactic collisions to look forward to but they probably wont have Niagara Falls Mount Rushmore total solar eclipses or Saturns rings They also wont have youBut you have you Except not all of it Babies dont begin to form episodicmemories right away meaning that you missed out on You dont remember two of the most seminal events in your life Your conception and your birth But you can experience a bit of those moments right nowFirst of all When Was I Conceived dot comlets you enter your birthday and get back the week your parents probably made you happen as well as the number onesong and the number one movie of that week which may have also been involved Light travels quickly the most quickest in factBut it can take a photon millions of years to escape from the interior of the starit was created in through nuclear fusion It takes time just like your own gestation in your mothers wombNewly conceived photons struggle through a dense stellar jungle of atoms and molecules and electrons thatabsorb and reemit the photon taking a little bit of energy from it as a randomly rolls around like a pinballSometimes after thousands or millions of years its random walk finally leads it to the stars surface where it pops out into space In a way is born A lucky tiny tiny tinypercentage of the photons that reach the surface of a star find themselves on a path that will intersect with earthAnd if you are lucky those photons will end their journey by being absorbed under your own retinaIf you enter the date of your birth or the approximate date of your conception intothis online calculator you can find a star that is as manylight years away from earth as you are oldWhen you look up at that start today you are seeing light that left the star the very month you were born or photons that left that star and entered space whenyour entire body was just one cell Space is really big and your life is very short but space is so gosh darn big you donthave to miss out on everything And as always thanks for watching,121.22241086587437,radioactivecontamination,0.0,1.0,7uiv6tKtoKg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uiv6tKtoKg
Where Do Deleted Files Go?,2013-07-20T15:40:34Z,10.583333333333334,18395690,553895,Hey Vsauce Michael hereBut now Im not Im gone like 90 ofthe original silent films ever madeSix of the seven wonders of the ancient world deleted like that text you thought twice about sending or a Snapchat photo right When Stalin decided that Trotsky wasan enemy of the state he had Trotsky removed from photos he appeared in with LeninPlenty of software tools and professional services allow you to do the sameDont just forget the actual attendees of a moment in time delete themBut where do things go when theyre deleted The Google Ngram Viewer allows youto search words and phrases in 52 million books published between 1500 and 2008Its a great way to see how the words we use have changed overtime 1979 was a significant year According to the Ngram Viewerit was the first year we begin to use the word delete more often than the word eraseBiological deletion still wins though Forget is by far morepervasive in our communication but how does a computer forget Moving a file to the trash is just the beginning To protect against accidental deletionwhen thrown in the trash a file remains on your computer in atemporary directory a sort of purgatory where it awaits a moreultimate deletion but can be resurrected if you wishWhen you empty the trash you are warned that you cannot undo the action But when you empty the trash the physical space inhabited by the file isnt actually emptied Its marked as emptyAvailable if and when new data needs to be stored somewhere The files home has become available real estate but the file itself hasnt moved outOnly the pointers have gone away Pointers are another typeof data on your drive that point to places in memory where the actual file they are referencingcan be found Theyre a bit like the table of contentswhich means that on most operating systems deleting a file and emptying the trash is like deleting a chapter from a book by turning to the table of contents and marking the chapter as emptyTheres nothing here do what you want with the pages To a computer reading the table ofcontents it looks like the space is empty but of course that doesnt changethe fact that the contents of the chapter are still thereSpecial data recovery tools look through memory marked empty available to see whats actually thereIf youre lucky they can even find a file and save it bring it back mark it not available undeleted But if some of the file has already been overwritten there can be problemsThe file can be corrupted melded together with otherdata like some kind of digital Frankensteins monsterA couple years ago a laptop that belonged to photographerMelanie Willhide was stolenIt contained many of her recent digital photos Luckily police were able to return thelaptop to her They found it in a car they pulled over but the thief had wiped the laptopshard drive clean and had been using it for his own purposes Data recovery experts were able to find some of her files still thereon the nowempty space but the files had been slightly overwritten by things the thief had doneTheyd been corrupted but in a really cool waySo cool Willhide decided to exhibit the work She titled the show after the thief who made it possible To Adrian Rodriguez with love If you want to delete the file so completely it cant even be recovered in a coolweird way like Willhides photos you will need to overwrite the unwanted file completelyDeny the file a proper burial and rearrange its corpse with new data One overwrite should be fine but somepeople do as many as 35 Even 35 overwrites might not be enough Sure the overridden data is hidden but what about bad sectors These are parts of a drive thatdevices cant access because of failed transistors or physical damage An overwrite wont be able to reach themmeaning any data that was ever put there stays there So if you are the UnitedStates Department of Defense and you dont want to take any risks you will also shred physically polarize unwanted drivesThe US Europe Japan often send such electronics waste to dumps in Ghana like this oneThis city in Ghana is known as Earths digital dumping ground Why GhanaWell it is cheaper to send unsalvageable electronics to Africamarked as a donation than it is to properly recycle them But there in these electronic dumps the files can still be brought back to life Organized criminals operating in Ghanahave managed to successfully recover data from unregulated edumpsTheyve been able to find confidential multimilliondollar agreements involving the Defense Intelligence Agency Homeland Security and the TSAShredding paper to get rid of whatever used to beon the paper isnt even safe either Its not easy and it doesntalways work But by scanning shreds of paper computer software canmatch the pieces together But in the past shredded documents have been unshred by hand In 1979 Iranian students seizedthe US Embassy in Tehran With the help of local carpet weavers andyears of hard work they managed to reassemble thousands ofpages of confidential documents shred by the CIAThe smaller the shredded particles are and the more of them there arethe more difficult the task So the Department of Defense requires thatthe majority of shredded particles not exceed 5 square millimetres If you really want to delete something destroy it erase it time is on your side In about 54 billion years the Sun will become the ultimate shredder A red giant large enough to swallow earth whole Everything will be fine for billions of years But many accepted models of the universepredict that in 10 to the 100 years whatever intelligence is left willwitness the universes dark era and its final Heat Death the end of the universe the end of any file or photo or memory of you ever being accessed againEvery time something happens a little bit of energy is lostFor instance friction through sound or heatThat energy goes out into the universe a little bit at a time slowly more and moreEventually in a closed system energy becomes homogeneousevenly distributed the same everywhereTheres no gradient maximum entropyIn a little glass of ice water its pretty quotidian but given enough time our entire universe may be no different A gradienta difference in energy from one place to another is necessary for things to happen for files to be created and read for life to existAnd in 10 to the 100 years there may not be any usable energy leftIn Isaac Asimovs short story The Last Question humans are concerned about thisAs the story leapfrogs billions of years into the future their list of solutions doesnt get any longer than none So if we think across a grand timescale is cosmic deletion the freezing of everything heat death all we have to look forward to in this universe We went to the MoonWe brought flags with us that we planted on theMoon representing a place on earthBut those American flags on the Moon are likely erased now their symbols and colors bleached by theintense radiation of the Sun on the lunar surface unfiltered by any atmosphereThe flags are still there we didnt take them back with us but now day are empty White flagsWhite flags representing our surrender to the inevitability of deletion in the universe But we today are preoccupied with just the oppositeWhat really saturates our language what we really seem to talk about is creationThings happening not lossCompared to erase forget and delete make practically deletes deletion The flags on the Moon are bleached out but is that bleakAre they deleted or blank like a fresh sheet of paper ready for new storiesReally it just depends on what you make of itSo thanks for making things And as always thanks for

Are We Ready For Aliens?,2013-07-13T00:09:44Z,10.616666666666667,14160518,262209,Hey Vsauce Michael hereBut what could be out thereThe likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligence has been the subject of an equation and the current lack of any communication with aliens the subject of a paradoxBut heres a different question If we were to hear from intelligent life beyond earth what would really happen nextWell no government has ever officially adopted a postdetection policy And when asked how they would deal witha confirmed message from extraterrestrial intelligence the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs simply said that their job does notinclude any issues regarding the question you pose So are we unprepared Would chaos ensue These things are unlikely but the way we prepare for and anticipate ourspecies encountering one from beyond earth is important and illuminating even though improbableHistorically we have acted as though alien life existsBack contamination is a concern that amanmade object returning from space could carry with it undiscovered alienlife forms especially viruses and bacteria that could wipeout life on earthThis was a serious concern dealt by serious people when we first sent humans to the MoonWhen Neil Armstrong Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrinreturned from the lunar surface they didnt immediately hugged theirfamilies and join a public parade Instead they were sealed up inbiological isolation garments and flown to a quarantine facility to be lockedaway for three weeks in Houston Texas By Apollo 15 the practice wasdiscontinued but forward contamination has also been a real concern When NASA sent theGalileo spacecraft to serve a Jupiter and its moons it got amazing data but there was a problemIt had never been sterilizedBecause life even liquid water could exist on these moons NASA made the decision toavoid contaminating an alien biosphere and the mission was oversteered Galileo into Jupiter where it burned up and was destroyed along with any Earth life possibly on boardSo protocols and decisions have been officially made in the past under the assumption that aliens might exist When it comes to actually hearing from aliens receiving a message fromtechnologically advanced life forms capable of sending us say a radio signal groups like SETI the search for extraterrestrialintelligence are other ones actively listening They have an ear to the skyAnd they are prepared The SETI committee of theInternational Academy of Astronautics created a declaration of principlesconcerning activities following the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence No government has officially adoptedany of its recommendations but if something were to happenit would likely be the first place authorities wentIts one of the only handbooks theyd have Seth Shostack explained thephilosophy in atmosphere at SETI predicting that because verifying a signal is slow and the media are fast you will be mediablasted about a possible detection days before the people who find it arecertain its for real In the midst of rampant media speculation elation and panic on the part of the public the most likely string of official events after the discovery of a message fromextraterrestrial life would follow SETI recommendationsFirst of all the individual or team who discovered the message would continue to assess the credibility of the message and alert all parties to SETIs declarationNext once they were certain the message wasreal the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams would be alerted so as to inform observers all over the world They would also inform the secretarygeneral of the United Nations because article 11 of the treaty on principles governingthe activities of states in the exploration and use of outer spaceincluding the Moon and other bodies says they shouldThe first official news we got the public would likely be in terms of the Rio ScaleFirst presented to the International Astronautical Congress the Rio Scale measures the significance of consequences ofevidence of extraterrestrial life making it a likely tool to be usedbecause it neatly manages public reaction Theres a great onlinecalculator you can play with to see how the Rio scale worksIt takes into account the credibility of the message on a scale from believed extraterrestrial origin to hoax how repeatable the observation is what type of message it is for instanceis it uninterpretable or clearly for us and how far away it is Is it extra galactic or near enough thatwe could respond and hear back within the length of a human lifetimeSeth Shostak and Ivan Almar applied the Rio scale to fictional and historical events Its a great way to get a feel forhow the Rio scale will affect vocabulary authorities use when reporting on an extraterrestrial messageThey considered the Moon monolith discovered in 2001 A Space Odyssey a 6 on the Rio scale  noteworthy In the movie Independence Daythe initial unidentified signal would be about 4 to 8 moderate too farreaching Once the message is confirmed to be nofurther than the Moon and moving it would be an automatic 10 extraordinary In real life the Martian Face discovered in 1976 was a 2  low Until high resolutionimages from 2001 revealed it was nothing just a thing that looked funnyunder the right conditions and was immediately downgraded to zero no significanceSo if we were to receive a message from extraterrestrial intelligencethose things in those words would likely be usedBut who would be in charge Although she denies ever being selectedor prepared for such a role Mazlan Othman the director at theUnited Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs is a pretty good candidateAs is Paul Davies the chairman of SETIs postdetection task force Were it to be necessary both of thosepeople are in positions to become ambassadors for earthalien relationsSo what do we say back Well if we want to show that we areintelligent perhaps we should send back a string of information representing Pi or the Fibonacci sequenceOr maybe we shouldnt say anything at all Stephen Hawking warned quote If aliens visit us the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in Americawhich didnt turn out well for the Native AmericansAnd professor Simon Conway Morris a Cambridge University palaeontologist has said that if the cosmic phone rings we shouldnt pick it up Observations like that are at the core of the importance ofthis videos question We can learn a lot by looking not just at how we prepare fora space message but how we imagine actual contact with aliens goingAnthropologist Katherine Denny frequently points out that the ways weimagine a contact with aliens happening often says more about ourselves than it does any hypothetical aliensWe do this all the timeWhen we project our ownmodernday ambitions and fears onto prehistoric people Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá call that flintstoningSo lets piggyback off of that phrase and label any projection of modern humanbehaviors desires anxieties onto futuristic technologically advancedbeings capable of visiting us jetsonsingSome examples of jetsonsing involve thinking that any aliens out theretrying to contact us might want to hurt us Maybe thatssimply because whenever we have met new people we often enslave them or pity them or take advantage of themIts also possible to think that aliens will be friendly Theyll want to help usThe ways we imagine them helping us say a lot about the kind of help wethink we need Theres a poetic idea that from space Earth looks peacefulAll of the boundaries we have put up dont exist you cant see themBut thats not entirely trueThe old boundary between East and West Germany is still visible from spaceeach side using different lightbulbsAnd this is the boundary between Pakistan and IndiaYou can see from space India flooding the border with lights todeter smugglers from bringing across weapons and ammunitionWe dont all get along together here on earth we are afraid of each otherwe dont trust each other and the wrinkles and scars that causes are visible from spaceImagining how aliens would interpret thatcommunicate with us and how we would or should respond teaches us a lot about ourselvesIt makes our struggles strange againLess ignorable And that is the entire point of fantasy G K Chesterton said that thefunction of the imagination is not to make strange things settleso much as to make settled things strange And as always thanks for

Why Are Things Creepy?,2013-07-02T20:10:17Z,8.866666666666667,23725711,619241,Hey VsauceMichael here Fear gives us lifeBeing afraid of the right things kept our ancestors alive It makes sense to be afraidof poisonous insects or hungry tigers but what about fear when there is no clear andobvious danger For instance a Teddy Bear with a full set of human teethor a smilejpg Theres something a little off about these images Too much mystery and strangenessbut no obvious threat the way there is with a gun or falling rock But yet they stillinsight fear because they are creepy But why What gives us the creeps What causes something to be creepy We are now in my bedroom the bedroom I grewup in in Kansas Like a lot of children my age I was terrified of Scary Stories toTell in the Dark But the very first book that ever scared me was The Curse of theSquirrel To this day I still havent finished the bookbut thats just me Psychologist James Geer developed the FearSurvey Schedule II which he used to find out what scared us the most Combined withthe results of a more recent Gallup poll these are the things that scare most of usthe most All of these things are scary but are they creepy Lets get more specific I love the way Stephen King delineates threetypes of scary stuff The first is the grossout This is something disgusting morbid diseasedThe second is horror Horror to King is the unnatural a giant spider or being grabbedin the dark when you thought you were alone The third terror is different creepierHe says terror is coming home to find that everything that you own has been replaced withan exact copy Terror is feeling something behind you Its breath on your neck Knowingthat you will be grabbed but then turning around to find that there was never anythingthere in the first place Not a lot of research has been done on that feeling the creepsBut many theories and ideas involve vagueness ambiguityFor instance masks and why clowns are creepy Claude LeviStrauss wrote that the facialdisguise temporarily eliminates from social intercourse the part of the body which revealspersonal feelings and attitudes Part of the reason even a neutral or happy mask can becreepy may have to do with ambiguity A mask hides the true emotions and intentions ofthe person underneath I dont know if the person wearing that mask is a threat or not Vagueness is creepy when it comes to the humanform This is the famous Uncanny Valley On a chart of humanness theres a zone wheresomething can be almost entirely human but off by just a little Not so wrong that itsclearly fake or funny or so good that its indistinguishable Instead its just troubling The creepiness of the Uncanny Valley is wonderfullydemonstrated by John Bergerons Singing Androids Watch these videos when youre alone A similar uneasy feeling comes from ShayeSaintJohna character created by Eric Fournier Funny to some nightmare fuel to others Uncanny humanoids like all creepy thingsstraddle a line between two regions that we can understand and explain with languageFrancis T McAndrew and Sara Koehnke describe being creeped out as an adaptive human responseto the ambiguity of threats from others Creepy things are kind of a threat maybebut theyre also kind of not So our brains dont know what to do Some parts respondwith fear while other parts dont and they dont know why So instead of achieving atypical fear response horror we simply feel uneasy terror creeped out Between the mountainsof safety and danger there is a valley of creepiness where the limits of our knowledgeand trust and security arent very clear Will looking at this cause you to die oneweek later Impossible right Maybe thats the terror of ambiguity We dont do well with ambiguity When it involvesour own intentions it can make us lie And when it involves danger but no recognizablethreat it can make us think and feel some pretty weird things Have you ever peeredover a ledge a railing way high up like so high up it made you nervous and dizzyand felt something pushing you Maybe even an urge to jump Have you ever stood on theledge with a loved one and realize that you could push them It would be that easyYou really could do it and maybe you do want to do it or maybe its just cognitive dissonanceThe fact that your brain is having to deal with ambiguity A recent study by Jennifer Hames at FloridaState University dubbed this the High Place Phenomenon When approaching a ledge and adangerous drop your survival instinct kicks in and you pull yourself away But your balanceand motor systems dont get it Nothing is pushing you and you dont normally fall orleap randomly So whats going on The part of your brain that processes intention mightresolve this by determining that something must be pushing you Or that you might actuallywant to jump or push your friend even if none of that is true Now were not done with ambiguity yet becauseour language reflects the gray area of terror and creepiness Take a look at the word terroritself We have horrible and horrific Terrible and terrific Why is thatWell through history we never really figured out what to call powerful experiences becausetheyre both They are full of aweawesome And they are full of awawful We needthem to survive We need fears and the creeps to understand our size our weaknessesBut on the other hand avoiding them is pretty great tooThe creeps is a physical reminderthat the world is vague and full of ambiguity but that we are cunning always trying tofigure things out but nonetheless fragile Is that terrible or terrific Well its bothWhich as a creepy ghost would say is kind of bootiful And as always thanks for watching,108.60902255639097,wonderfullydemonstrated,0.0,-1.0,PEikGKDVsCc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEikGKDVsCc
What is the Shortest Poem?,2013-06-22T17:48:00Z,8.65,7240441,187908,Hey Vsauce Michael hereI am in Green Bank West Virginia Pocahontas CountyAnd my favorite word is  I learned it from Big Bird and its not so much a word as the alphabet if you try to pronounce it like a wordIts a neat trick almost poetic But what counts as poetryHow short can something be and still be a poemWhat is the shortest poem in the world and why does knowing it matter Okay now I am in Charlottesville Virginia in a hotel roomIm on the road this week Take a look at my amazingly fancy set upA popular contender for the shortest story in the world is apocryphally attributed to Ernest HemingwayIt contains only six wordsFor sale Baby shoes Never wornA popular contender for the title of worlds shortest poem and the one honored atWorldsShortestPoemcom is a clever couplet attributed to Strickland Gillilan titled on the Antiquity of Microbes or sometimes just FleasIt goes like this  Fleas  Adam  Had emBut shorter rhyming couplets are possibleGyles Brandreth wrote the very cute Ode to a Goldfish Oh wet  pet Muhammad Ali composed an even shorterrhyming couplet when he spoke at Harvard in 1975Using just 4 letters his poem poignantly sums up the power of role models and leadersThe idea that as one man climbs the rest are lifted upThe poem is simply me  we But a poem doesnt need to rhyme or contain multiple wordsA poem is simply a type of literary art that uses aesthetic or rhythmicproperties of a language to mean more than it normally wouldWith that definition in mind take a look at my favorite one word poem by Aram Saroyan The word light with an extra ghThe poem became controversial because the NEA paid him 500 for the poemCritics berated it for its simplicity but that only made it more famous and popular Lighght Its fun to type and its fun to say because what sound does the gh in the word light really makeIs this a lighter fluffier extended version of light or is it a gargled choking oneWe can get shorter one letter poemsTwo of my favorites are  fit  n and  nought  tOf course should the title count when measuring the length of a poemWell maybe I like Geof Huths two letter amalgam poem The letter L with the letter Y on top of itmaking a brand new character Now of course an L and a Y is a great way to make an adverbIts the difference between strange and strangely Here in this very poemwe have the difference between you and what you do in one simple shapeBefore they stopped tracking the record the Guinness Book ofWorld Records considered Aram Saroyan the author of the worlds shortest poem Here it isThe letter m with an extra humpIs it a letter or an imageSome have called it a close up of an alphabet being born Its cells still in the process of dividing the m and the n not quite separatedBut from what Ive read in my opinion the shortest poem ever the shortest use of languageaesthetically arhythmically to mean more than the word itself is jwcurrys composition of the lower case letter i dotted with his own fingerprintThe fingerprint makes it his I means me but this one can only mean him For fun lets talk about situations in which language isnt even usedWe are entering the realm of poetryWhat Geof Huth calls a moment when a writer writes nothing instead of anything R W Watkins composed a poem that only suggested language In reality it simply contained places where language could goThere are also plenty of empty musical compositionsSongs that are nothing simply silenceJohn Denver even composed one His Ballad of Richard Nixon is silence and you can buy it in the iTunes Store for 99 cents But who caresIs knowing the worlds shortest poem just a neat piece of trivia a cool thingto tell your friends but in the end a useless pub factI mean the Guinness Book of World Records hasstopped compiling records for artistic briefnessWhat youre about to see is possibly the shortest concert ever put on It was done by the White Stripesin Newfoundland in 2007 Here it comes And there it went Thats all The Guinness Book of World Recordsrefused to recognize that concert as being the shortestbecause they said quote The nature of competing to makesomething the shortest by its very naturetrivializes the activity being carried as such we have beenforced to cease listing records for the shortest song shortest poem and indeed the shortest concert TrivializesMaybe But we can say and sing and write anddraw a lot of powerful things regardless of what authority recognizes its size or lack thereofAppreciating the power carried by even the tiniest poem is a great way toput into perspective just how cool that isWhen he died Fernando Pessoa left behind a chest full of his thoughts and experiences written down Decades after his death they werepublished into The Book of DisquietHis thoughts and experiences didnt die along with him he had writtenthem down he had narrated them and in this book he discusses the power of narration compared to simply existing living seeing YOLOingHe said Direct experience is an evasion a hiding place for those without any imagination To narrate is to create while to live is merely to be livedAnyone can live a lifeHis question would be what have you said about itEven the worlds shortest poem is still a comment a narration Even the worlds shortest poem even a silence thats purposeful and means something can be mindblowingly

What Is The Greatest Honor?,2013-06-13T16:48:15Z,9.983333333333333,7499689,225912,Hey Vsauce Michael hereBut where is here and how much does it weigh Thats the supposed to be me huhImitation is a form of flattery An honorBut what is the greatest honor possible Lets begin our journey by looking atchallenges and achievements worthy of honourFirst the physical ones Being the fastest person to run a marathon 262 miles is great but why stop there The Iron Man triathlon involves swimming  24 miles racing on a bicycle 112 miles and then running an entire marathon Record holder Craig Alexander did it all in 8 hours 3 minutes and 56 seconds Beyond that things begin to get mental The self transcendence race held everysummer in New York is the longest certified foot race on the planetIts not 26 miles long its 3100 And instead of running thousands of milesacross the varied landscape of the US competitors merely run around the same city block in Queens 5 649 times You have 52 days to complete therace and doing so can wear out as many as 12 pairs of shoes The fastest time for completing the racegoes to Wolfgang Schwerk who finished in just 41 days averaging 75 miles of running every dayIn the realm of entertainment there are very clear physical rewards statuettes like the Emmy the Grammy the Oscar and the Tony Winning at least one of each is called an EGOT So far 11 humans have won allfour awards in competitive categories Marvin Hamlisch and Richard Rodgersalso each won a Pulitzer Prize Lynn Redgrave is the only person to haveever been nominated for all four awards without winning a single oneSome people have won surprising combinations of awards Steve Tisch as chairman and executivevice president of the New York Giants and producer of films like Forrest GumpAmerican History X and Snatch is the only person in historyto have won both a Super Bowl ring and an Oscar And throughout all of human history only one person has won an Oscar and a Nobel Prize George Bernard ShawThose are neat facts but lets define honour There are twoguys we should go to The first is Noah Webster whose American Dictionary is the reason Americans spell it honor The second guy is SamuelJohnson whose English Dictionary is the reason people across the Atlantic where I usually am spell it honour Johnson differentiated two typesof honored that are relevant to the question in this videos titleThe first is what he calls nobility of soul magnanimity and the scorn of meanness This is honour derived not fromachievement at something competitive but rather from perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrityBut what counts as a virtue One of my favorite attemptsto catalog human virtues was done by Christopher Peterson and Martin SeligmanFrustrated by a persistent focus on mental illness they devised a guide to mental wellnessTheir catalog contains 24 virtues and strengths shared across nearly every human cultureThey attached historical figures believed to personify each trait andtheir list of 24 included fairness humility hope humor appreciation of beauty and the love of learningUsing their list as a scorecard for virtue points to determine the most honorable person is impossible but that hasnt stopped people fromdiscussing the greatest honor in terms of virtueRichard Nixon did some things that people might consider dishonorable but his perspective is illuminating In his first inaugural address he said the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemakerPeacemaker But who has the authority to judge virtue Hopefully not individualsRichard Wisemans brilliant Quirkology discusses a survey conductedin 1997 by US News  World Report which asked people who they thought was somewhat likely to go to heaven as a marker of perceived virtuousconduct and personal integrity its really illuminating52 percent thought that Bill Clinton would60 percent but Princess Diana would and a full 79 percent saidthat they thought Mother Teresa would go to heaven but she was only secondplace 87 percent of respondents agreed that someone else was likely to go to heavenWho do they think that was ThemselvesThe greatest honor a country bestows upon those who have defended fought for it often carries the most aweinspiring storiesThe greatest military honor in the United Kingdom is the Victoria CrossIn the United States its the Medal of Honor given forconspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of dutyMany of its recipients are honored posthumouslyThey are people who acted instantly and without regard for their own safety theyve walked into enemy fire loosing their lives to communicate lifesaving messagesThey have fallen on grenades to absorb the impact with their bodies so that others around them wouldnt have to Samuel Johnsons second definition of honor focuses not so much on honor that comes from being ethically excellent but instead on honor that comes from power from being royal or famous Global surveys have shownthat many corporate logos like the golden arches are more famousthan any celebrity or other symbolsSo technically speaking the greatest honor as far as becoming famous and globally known might simply be to become a fast food mascot Not all honorable people get honored How does a grand recognized public act made possible by being in the rightplace at the right time with the right opportunities compare to the honor of merely being the best person you can beA good citizen a mother a father an otherwise unrecognized person who is nonetheless an amazing hero to a few Your family your friends that one person who really needed youIs recognition merely an accident of luckA snowball effect an accumulation of advantagePeople who stand out when they are young are often given access to more opportunities which then leads to and entitles themto more opportunities later on accumulating overtime like snow on asnowball that eventually becomes an entire boulder of snow only the original snowball of whichwas the original person Historians have pointed this phenomenonout the accumulation of advantage when criticizing the great man theory of historyThe idea that human history can be talked or understood as a time line of few important honored individuals Philip Zimbardo the researcher behind the infamous Stanford Prison study has shown that thewrong situation can bring out evil in almost anybodyHe stressed in his recent TED talk that not all of us will encounter justthe right opportunities to become the next Gandhi or Neil ArmstrongBut what we can do is live our lives with what Zimbardo calls a heroic imaginationAs a hero and waiting who thinks sociocentrically not egocentrically He says most heroes are everyday people who emerge as heroes in particular situations So a fair argument can be made that simply knowing you did the right thing whenpresented with the situation involving Peterson and Seligmans virtues and strengths is the greatest honour possible the most honorable life Now whether or not that honorablebehavior is recognized Well Cato the Elder questioned the value imparted by physical awards by simply saying after Im dead Id rather have people ask why I have no monument than why I have oneIts an honor to talk to you guys every weekSo as always thanks for

Is Anything Real?,2013-06-03T18:00:15Z,11.533333333333333,21865295,619169,Hey Vsauce Michael hereWhere are your fingers Seriously Its a pretty easy questionYou should be able to answer it But how do you knowHow does anyone know anything You might say wellI know where my fingers are Im looking right at them Or I can touch them I can feel them theyreright here and thats good Your senses are a great way to learn things In fact we have way more than the usualfive senses we talk about For instance your kinesthetic sense proprioception This is what the police evaluateduring a field sobriety test It allows you to tell where your fingersand arms and head and legs in your body is all in relation to each other without having to look or touch other things We have way more than five senses wehave at least twice as many and then some But theyre not perfectThere are optical illusions audio illusions temperature sensation illusions even tactile illusionsCan you turn your tongue upside down If so perfect Try thisRun your finger along the outer edge of the tip of your upside down tongue Your tongue will be able to feel your finger but in the wrong place Our brains never needed to develop an understanding of upside down tongue touchSo when you touch the right side of your tongue when its flipped over to your left sideyou perceive a sensation on the opposite side where your tongue usually is but isnt when its upside downIts pretty freaky and cool and a little humblingbecause it shows the limits of the accuracy of our senses the only tools wehave to get whats out there in hereThe philosophy of knowledge the study of knowing is called Epistomology Plato famously said that the things we know are things that are true that we believe and that we have justification for believingthose justifications might be irrational or they might be rational they might be based on proof but dont get too confident becauseproven is not a synonym for true Luckily there are things that we can know without needing proof without needing toeven leave the house things that we can know as true by reason aloneThese are things that we know a prioriAn example would be the statement all bachelors are unmarriedI dont have to go survey every bachelor on earth to know that that is true All bachelors are unmarriedbecause thats how we define the word bachelor Of course you have to know what the words bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place Oh you do Okay Perfect Thats greatBut how do you knowThis time I mean functionally how do you knowWhere is knowledge biologically in the brainWhat are memories made out of We are a long way from being able toanswer that question completely but research has shown that memoriesdont exist in the brain in single locationsInstead what we call a memory is likely made up of many different complex relationships all overthe brain between lots of brain cells neurones A major cellular mechanismthought to underlie the formation of memories is longterm potentiation or LTPWhen one neurone stimulates another neurone repeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtime LTP wiring them more strongly together and that connection can last a long time even an entire lifetimeA collection of different brain cells neurones that fire together in a particular order over and over again frequently and repeatedly can achieve longterm potentiation becoming more sensitive to each other and moreready to fire in the exact same way later on in the futureTheyre a physical thing in your brain firing together more easily because you strengthen that pattern of firing You memorizedThis branching forest of firing friends looks messy but look closerIt could be the memory of your first kissA living souvenir of the eventIf I were to go into your brain and cut out those cells could I make you forget your first kiss or could I make you forget where your fingers are Only if I cut out a lot of your brain Because memories arent just stored in onerelationship theyre stored all over the brain The events leading upto your first kiss are stored in one network the way it felt to the way it smelled indifferent networks all added up together making what you call the memory of your first kiss How many memories can you fit inside your headWhat is the storage capacity of the human brainThe best we can do is a rough estimate but given the number ofneurons in the brain involved with memory and the number of different connectionsa single neurone can make Paul Reber at Northwestern University estimated that we can store the digital equivalent of about 25 petabytes of informationThats the equivalent of recording a TV channel continuously for 300 years Thats a lot of informationThat is a lot of information about skills you can do and facts and people youve met things in the real world The world is real right How do you knowIts a difficult question but its not rocket scienceInstead it is asking whether or not rocket scientistseven exist in the first place The theory that the Sun moved around the earth worked great It predicted that the Sunwould rise every morning and it did It wasnt until later that werealized what we thought was true might not beSo do we or will we ever know true reality or are we stuck in a world where thebest we can do is be approximately true Discovering more andmore useful theories every day but never actually reaching true objective actual reality Can science or reason ever prove convincingly that your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers actually exist beyond your mindThat you dont just live in the matrix NoYour mind is all that you have even if you use instruments like a telescope or particle acceleratorsThe final stop for all of that information is ultimately youYou are alone in your own brain which technically makes it impossible to prove that anything else existsIts called the egocentric predicamentEverything you know about the world out there depends on and is created inside your brain This mattered so much to Charles Sanders Peircethat he drew a line between reality the way the universe truly is and what he called the phaneronthe world as filtered through our senses and bodies the only information we can get If you want to speak with certainty you live in that is you react to and remember and experience your phaneron not reality The belief that only you exist and everything else food the universeyour friends are all figments of your mind is calledsolipsism There is no way to convince a solipsist that the outside world is realAnd there is no way to convince someone who doubts that the universe wasnt createdjust three seconds ago along with all of our memoriesIts a frightening realization that we dont always know how to deal withTheres even The Matrix defenseIn 2002 Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady She argued that she believed she was inthe matrix that her crimes werent realBy using the matrix defense she was found not guilty by reason of insanity because theopposite view is just way more healthy and common Its called realismRealism is the belief that the outside world exists independently of your own phaneronRocks and stars and Thora Birch would continue to exist even if you werent around to experience themBut you cannot know realism is trueAll you can do is believeMartin Gardner a great source for math magic tricks explained that he is not a solipsistbecause realism is just way more convenient and healthy and it works As to whether it bothered him that hecould never know realism was true he wrote if you ask me to tell youanything about the nature of what lies beyond the phaneron my answer is how should I knowIm not dismayed by ultimate mysteries I can no more grasp what is behind such questions as my cat can understand what isbehind the clatter i make while I type this paragraphHumble stuff What strikes me is the catCats do not understand keyboards but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be Its a great way to get the attentionof a human theyre warm and exciting surrounded by noises andflashing lights plus cats love to get their scenton whatever they can a mark of their existence We arent that much differentexcept instead of keyboards we have the mysteries of the universe We will never be able to understand allof them We wont be able to ever answer every single question but walking

Why Do We Feel Nostalgia?,2013-05-27T19:16:41Z,15.366666666666667,8082055,187827,Hey Vsauce Michael hereMusic Why does music make us feel the way it does Why does music make us wanna move And why do songs sometimes gets stuck in our heads James May from the YouTube channel Head Squeeze thanks for the music PleasureWhy can music bring back memories That is a very good question actuallyIve often wondered why it has this power actually to unlock a completely dormantmemory something thats gone as far as you know and then it chooses usually a pop tunefrom say ten or twenty years ago bang there you are wherever you were at the timeSometimes its positive sometimes its negative but what is nostalgia Well it turns out that nostalgia and feeling emotions because of music and dancing and getting songs stuck in your head all orbit around a common theme Your identityBecause really physically speaking who are you Every single day you are losing atoms and gaining new onesfrom what you eat and drink It takes about five years to replaceevery atom in your body which means that the matter that we call you today was not part of you five years agoIf we speed the process up we start to see that your physical body really all of us every human on earth is just a temporary group of atoms andmolecules that nonetheless keep the same name the whole timeNow this is what we think of when we think of our bodies but to an alien who could track individual atoms and only saw maybe a few frames per decadeyou would appear to be what you really areA bunch of incoming atoms making your shape and then leaving So whats consistent hereWhat are you Nostalgia fondly remembering the past what you used to do and who used to be mightsimply be a way for your brain to answer that question or at least cooldown the anxieties it causes Because even at a macroscopic scaleyou are always changing You have different friendsdifferent behaviors different moods different tastes all the timeIf you grew up in the 80s and by that I mean 1680s it would have been possible to have beennostalgic for a time before the word nostalgia existed Thats because in 1688 Johannes Hofer coined the term by combining the Greek words for returning home and pain Nostalgia was originally seenas a quite serious medical condition affecting soldiers who missed home so much that they broke down and were unable tofulfil their duties The only cure as Hofer saw it was to be sent home to your home because nostalgia is really all about you Your memories your past who you used to be and consequently who you are now whichmakes nostalgia an often healthy way to answer the question who am I Well youre a person whoremembers specific events in the past You existed in the past and are a continuous being A popular theory argues that thepsychological effects of nostalgia connecting with your younger self andbuilding a continuous identity are advantageousand so were naturally selected to be rewarding experiencesYou change your habits your friends your jobyou learn things and forget things but nostalgia allows you to connect all of those events which is especially helpfulduring times of major life transitions like entering adulthood or agingwhen study showed that nostalgia is at its strongest But if tucking inand lining up all of your life experiences into a continuous story is so advantageous why dont we feel nostalgic for everything in the pastWhy dont you feel nostalgia for what happened one minute agoWhy dont you feel nostalgic for the way this video beganWell the lifespan retrieval curve might offer some clues Its an average plot of distinct autobiographical memories and it reveals what is called the reminiscence bump A time between 15 and 30 years ofthe age where more memories are encoded This time in your life both while youare living it and later is thought to be important because itsso linked to the formation of our selfidentitiesMemories formed during that bump tend to be the ones we are most nostalgic for and because we want our continuousidentities to be positive we tend to be nostalgic for good memories not bad onesIndividually and collectively we also tend to be nostalgic and reminisce on things as if they were better than at the time they really wereTwenty years after leaving his hometown Abraham Lincoln returned to it andlooking upon it remembering it nostalgically he wrote these lines of poetryMy childhoods home I see again and saddened with the view and still as memory crowds my braintheres pleasure in it tooAbraham Lincoln might seem like a quite ancient personsomeone from way back in history But heres some perspectiveOn February 9 1956 a date within the lives of some ofour parents and many of our grandparents this old man appeared on the television show Ive got a secretWhat made him so special Well he was Samuel J Seymour an eyewitnessGoodnight Mr SeymourHow old are you by the way Sir Ninety sixNinety six years old He was allive and in attendance atFords Theatre on the very day Abraham Lincoln was assassinated And he was alive recently enough to haveappeared on national televisionMusic doesnt have to bring up old memories or make you feel nostalgia in order to helpyou build an identity Lawrence Parsons in a great interviewdiscusses the fact that babies from about six months to oneyearclearly respond to all kinds of different rhythms and chords when only a single note or beat is out of placeBut after one year babies tend to only respond to rhythms and chords from their own culture from the world around them This makes sense when you consider justhow important it is for our brains to not only construct a continuous individual identity but a continuousidentity within the groups that we belongWe dont always get along with or understand other people but when twopeople listen to and respond to music their feelings and emotions canbecome more similar than if they were to merely sit in silence or use words with no rhythm So although we are still not exactlysure why music makes us wanna move the desire you have the impulse youhave to tap your foot or bob your head or if confident enough dance when you hear a rhythm might have lessto do with the behavior you have learned and more to do with your internal desire to fit it And as a consequence of ourimpressive ability to communicate and be social it even happens when you are alone orwhen you want to dance as if no one is watchingSpeaking of dance William Michael Brown motion capturedgood and bad dancers so he could render them into digital stick figures and remove all clues as to their fitnessor looks or health Now figures with symmetric movement what we might call good dancing were consistently ratedas more attractive and more desirable as mates But this may have less to do with musicbeing some special human behavior and more to do with communication in general Sharing a musical experience withsomeone else might just be an extreme form of the communication skills that werenaturally selected into us so that we could understand each otherunderstand a motion from tone of voice and listenSweet fatty foods taste good because they signal our brainthat they are full of energy Energy that we need to surviveThis is why cheesecake tastes so incredibleBut it doesnt mean that cheesecake is necessary for survival Music might be the same wayA happy accident of the communication skills we developedbut fundamentally an unnecessary one or as cognitivescientist Steven Pinker famously called it acoustic cheesecakeIf not properly chewed a bite of cheesecake can get lodged in your throat But a short repetitive song can get lodged in your brainIts called an ear worm At best it means that the song is catchyAt worst it means replaying over and over and over again the same song inyour head until you are annoyedAccording to research by James Kellaris nearly all of us experience ear worms Men and women experience them equally asoften but for reasons we dont quite understand yet ear worms tend to last longer for and be more irritating to womenRepetitive rhythms make a song easier to reproduce in our heads andunusual time signatures or unresolved or incomplete musical ideas bother us Perhaps because we strive tocommunicate completely and clearly so we fixate on these little snippets ofsongs replaying them over and over again in our heads hoping to resolve them which of course they dont meaning thatthey are quite literally a cognitive itchAn itch that that just gets worse by being scratchedOur inability to suppress a simple thought like the famous quick whatever you do dont think of a pink elephant or the game or a song stuck in your head might be explained by ironic process theory The idea that in our brains there aretwo different processes going on One which consciously controls what we think about and the other unconsciously monitoring what we are thinking aboutThey share an equal amount of cognitive effort and theyre always in balance and so moreeffort put into monitoring what youre thinking about means thattheres less left to actually control what you think about Spending that cognitive effort on someother task that uses working memory like Sudoku or anagrams can often help getan ear worm out of your head You can always just replace the ear wormwith another one using a service like Unhear itcomEar worms are annoying but music has the power to conjure upall kinds of other emotions when we hear it A major reason for thisis the fact that like our sense of smell music is initially processed in the sameregions of the brain that process memories and emotion like the amygdala So maybe those are answers  memories You might not have the same friends and job and house and atoms throughout your lifebut you do have the same memories so are you just your memories Well unfortunately that idea is a littletroublesome because memory loss doesnt necessarily make youa brand new different person and theres also the slight problem of false memoriesThese studies always freak me out Researchers bring in participants andshow them photographs from their childhood and ask him to tell a story about whathappened in the photo except one of the photos has been photoshopped It didnt really happenBut instead of noticing this fake image people tend to just make up a story and remember it as if itreally happened Couple weeks ago I went with Jake Chudnowwho does the music here on Vsauce to the Royal Observatory in GreenwichWe saw the seventhlargest telescope on earth and while there this song was playingIts called Longplayer Composed by Jem Finer Longplayer isconstructed by combining different recordings of singing bells Theyre combined in different waysso as to never repeat for 1000 years Longplayer began in 1999 and it will not finish the song will not be over for 1000 years Literally billions of humans will be born and die before Longplayer is finished playingThe sound waves the compression waves that send Longplayer into your ear arent that much unlike you your waves of atoms temporarilyorganizing atoms or molecules but not really causing any one atom or moleculeto stay along with you for the entire journeyJust as the ocean waves and bells ring as Alan Watts said the earth peoples In a way you are a slowcompression wave moving through Earths matterBut what is your waves sound like Does it make people wanna danceIt probably wont echo around for centuries after youregone but maybe while you are here you can get stuck in the head of some othertemporary wave An ear worm that they like and dont want to get rid of Thatd be a nice type of wave to be But can music make you smarter and can I play an instrumentWell to find out follow James and Iover to the YouTube channel Headsqueeze where we take a look at thosequestions And as always thanks for watching Thank you Seriously follows us over No seriously Right now Theres also a link Ill put in the descriptionso its like a piece of cake guys Come on Well well be over there waitingHes over there Im over there Im with him here and hes with me over there We

If,2013-05-20T22:52:36Z,13.383333333333333,17370630,398952,Hey Vsauce Michael hereEarlier this month I travelled to Kourou in French Guiana with euronews to watch the launch of Vega Rocket if it happened while I was there Waiting at theobservation point with only minutes to go the launch was postponed because of weather Even though the rocket scientists were using Comic Sans the rocket it didnt take off until the day after I had to be back in London But it made me thinkWe can send satellites into orbit and people to the moon and predicts solar eclipses thousands of years into the future but yet we cannot reliably predict which way thewind will be blowing in the next our or so How can suchmonumental cosmic movements light minutes or light years away fromus be understood whereas the weather which happens in thevery same layer of the atmosphere we live in every day remains such a mysteryWell it has to do with the limits of what we know and what we can knowPlanetary positions and terrestrial weather in the futureare determined by their initial conditions But over a short time scale predictingthe future position of a planet involves fewer variables than the weather In order to accurately predict theweather you need to know the complete and exact conditions of every molecule of air on EarthHow those molecules will interact with each other and the earth and how they will feedbackand influence themselves by changing other molecules This makes it incrediblydifficult to predict the weather more than a week in advanceAnd this problem isnt going to go away It is fundamental to our relationship with the universe Given enough time small unnoticeable unmeasurable unknowable factors get magnified again and again slowly until eventually their impact is vastly significant and our predictions today are hopeless Neil deGrasse Tyson mentions this in hisbrilliant Death by Black Hole where he points out that the recoilfrom the launch of a single space probe can influence our future insuch a way that in about 200 million years the position of Earth and its orbit aroundthe Sun will be shifted by nearly sixty degrees Edward Lorenz gave this phenomenonits popular name Predictability Does the Flap of a Butterflys wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas The butterfly effectA small change like a butterfly deciding to flap its wings can lead to a whole chain of eventswere bigger and bigger processes change just enoughto leave the even more significant changes until finally an entire storm occurs somewhere different or not at allThe discipline that such thinking kickstarted is known as chaos theory When the present determines the futurebut the approximate present does not approximately determine the future To us the universe is full of if But all things considered weare pretty good at predicting the future and preparing for it but some things are or were prepared for a futurethat hasnt occurred yet or never didAnd knowing more about those things sheds amazing perspective on the limits of our knowledge Speaking of limits lets begin with your life carpe diemAn online tool that when given your birth date uses the latest life expectancy data togive you back a grid of squaresOne square represents one week  seven days The lighter ones arethe weeks that you have already been alive the darker ones are what you have left Check sleep to see how many of your previous and future weeks will be spent sleepingOf course its just an approximation its difficult to know if you will have more or fewer weeks to comeIts hard to know when it will all end Its even more difficult to document unless you are Reynaldo Dagsa a councilman from the Philippines who took this photo of his family on New Years Day at the very same second that he was assassinatedThe photo was later used to catch the killerWe cant predict everything but in the event of an anticipated catastrophic event  severe weather an incoming nuclear attack or asteroid  how would we all know what was going on Well many countries have systems inplace to allow them to speak to as many people as quickly as possible The United States has the Emergency Alert SystemWhen triggered the system interrupts all programming on radio and television with messages generated using texttospeech automated voicesThe warning tones are known so whats kind of scary is that today we can take a peek and see what it would look like and whatit would sound like if a catastrophic event occurredIn this example a nuclear attack that threatened lifeacross the entire country First of all you would likely here sirens and then as you went tune into say TV this is what you would hear and see We interrupt our programming This is a national emergencyThe following message is transmitted at the request of the United States government This is not a test A nuclear attack isoccurring against the United States Four nuclear missiles have been launched from unknown locations and are expected to strike the UnitedStates within the next 15 minutes Due to the uncertain facts of thesemissiles all residents of the United States should seek out and prepare to take shelter immediately Stand by for a message fromthe President of the United States If a catastrophic event occurred of global proportions what would humanity do nextWell there might be survivors People hiddenaway in fortresses that we have built like the North American Aerospace Defense Command NORADBuilt into solid granite shielded by steel plating toprotect computer systems from electromagnetic pulses and supported on springs so as to safely sway in the event of an earthquakeNORAD can protect humans and equipment from a 30 megaton nuclear blast just a mile away After the event its places like this that would literally be humanitys lastbest chance of continuing life The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is onthe Norwegian island of SpitsbergenBuried 390 feet inside a mountain it safely stores and protects 250 million individual seeds for growing plants and crops if their vulnerable living relatives on the surface are all destroyed Soviet technology existed to put people on the Moon of course they never didIf Russia had sent men to the Moonthey would have walked around on it looking like this The Krechet94was designed in 1967 but never used for Soviet manned lunar excursion Russia did however sent the first man into space and the first woman into outer space They also sent the first dog into orbitaround the Earth Unfortunately the dog died too soonafter launch due to overheating But later they sent Belka and Strelka dogs on a rocket full of livingorganisms that became the very first to orbit the Earth and return to Earth aliveYou can still see them todayThe Moscow Cosmonautics Memorial Museumhas the two dogs preservedStuffed and on display as physical relics of earthlings growing up and leaving their planetI was also lucky enough to visit a restaurant in Moscow with menus  yep  that used Comic Sans Oh and I ate a star dog which in the cyrillic alphabet looks like its called crap dosis The United States of course did sendpeople to the Moon but recently we have learned that NASAat the time didnt know with the same certainty as other variables whether the first man on the Moon would be able to leave Just two days before humanityshistoric moon landing William Safire was asked to prepare a speech for President Nixon to read on television to the world if Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong became stranded on the MoonThirty years later William Safire explained that Aldrin andArmstrong were supposed to reunite with the command module orbiting the moonbut if they couldnt and there was a good risk that they couldnt then they would have to be abandoned on the Moon left to die there and mission control would then have to usetheir euphemism close down communicationand the men would have to either starve to death or commit suicide And so we prepared for that with the the speech that I wrote and the President was ready to to give thatLuckily Nixon never had to deliver the Moon disaster speech but to read it today thinking of those two guys still alive on the surface of the Moon knowing that they will never get back to Earth is chilingIncluded in that speech were these lines fate has ordained that the men who went to the Moon toexplore in peace will stay on the Moon to rest in peace These brave men Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin know that there is no hope for theirrecovery but they also know that their is hope for mankind in their sacrifice In ancient days men looked at the starsand saw their heroes in the constellationsIn modern times we do much the same but our heroes are epic men of flesh and bloodFor every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankindAnd thats what I took away most from my trip to Kourou Space isnt just a place for zerogtricks or imagining scifi technology space is everexpanding and full of corners of other worlds that couldone day become mankinds if we choose toAnd that doesnt minimize Earth The Vega rocket I went to see sent upsatellites designed to test electric solar wind sails forinterplanetary travel as well as satellites built to analyzethe health of Earths vegetation or to predict natural disasters Just as our bodies benefit from havingdoctors and instruments beyond them that can probe investigate and diagnose so does the earth Launch pads like the one in Kourou I got to visit are really just hospital waiting rooms for earth A place where our planet can waitfor researchers and scientists to put their tools their instruments into use into orbitWe may never know if something will or will not happen but by pursuing space corners of other worlds we gain a perspective that can help us shrink the size of that mysterious and oftenfrightening ifand as always And as always thanks for

What if You Were Born in Space?,2013-05-12T16:58:51Z,13.383333333333333,16228806,326127,Hey Vsauce Michael hereHow many people are in space right now dot com tells us that the answer is 6 Ever since the first person reached outer space 52 years ago more than 500 humans have left Earth and theyve gone as far as the moon an impressive distance I mean spacestations which we use in outer space today are way cool but to scale they only orbit about this far away from EarthWhereas the Moon where Apollo astronauts went is way out hereFor the last twelve years there has been a continuous anduninterrupted presence of humans living in spaceDifferent people at different times ever since November of 2001But so far all of us every human who has ever existed was born right here on Earth Of course Earth is a giantcollection of matter that got together in space held together by its own gravity so technically we were all born in spaceBut I wanna talk about outer spaceWhat is our relation to it and within it How suited is our biology for thelarger universe we were born into More specifically if you were born and raised beyond earth what would you look like First things firstWhere is outer spaceWell outer space happens to be about one hundred thousand meters above your head At that point the atmosphere is so thin that in order to achieve lift anaircraft has to travel at a speed so quickly that that speed is the same as an orbital speedAn orbital speed is a speed that is so fast even with no lift even while falling you dont because the earth literally curves away from you as fast as you fall towards it This is what astronauts inthe International Space Station are really doing Theyre falling Its a common misconceptionthat astronauts float around weightless in space because there is no gravity there But theres plenty of gravityIn fact theres pretty much the same amount of gravity operating on them that there isoperating on you right now while you watch this videoBelieve it or not if we build a tower all the way up towhere the International Space Station orbits 370000 meters high and you walked out onto the top of thattower it would feel kind of like this You would just be walking around like Im walking right now You wouldnt feel that much different but the International Space Stationwould be whizzing by at 17000 miles per hourIt has to because they are falling So to say thatastronauts float around in orbit because they are experiencing zero gravity is very misleadingReally what they are feeling is ZeroG where G is accelleration felt as weightG hurts so good because gravitys limiting influence insures that we develop correctly and healthfully After all it is what we were born to thrive in So asking what a human would look like if conceived gestated delivered and raised in orbit would look like requires a discussion of weightlessness Realistically people building colonieson planets beyond Earth or traveling through space for longperiods of time who expected new humans to be born wouldutilize technology that helped mimic conditions here on earth But until artificial gravity isperfected and can be easily implemented its important to understand the effectweightlessness has on our biology and other thingsFor instance in a zerog environment hot air doesnt riseSo a candle flame is not shaped like a stretched ball of glowing gas thats drawn upward Instead its just a round ball of hot gas We are not sure we can make babies in space The logistics of merelyhugging are difficult enough A recent invention called the 2suitmight make it easier The 2suit provides effortless intimacyin weightless environment such as outer space or on planets with low gravity But will it be enough to ensure thatconception happens The enzyme responsible for stopping themovement of a sperm cells tale doesnt work very well when theyre at zerog In space sperms swim fasterOne thing we know about babies inside mothers in space involves the development of the vestibular system Canals in theinner ear that use the flow of fluid to determine movement up versus down and balance In a zerog environment the fluid in thevestibular system just floats around Its confusedAnd this can lead to motion sickness visual illusions and disorientationIts called spaced adaptation syndrome and itaffects about 50 percent of astronautsConfusion about motion can make you vomit carsick seasick zerog sick because of survivalIts believed that motion sickness a confusion about acceleration is similar to the effects caused by theconsumption of poisonous plants in which case vomiting can save your life Pregnant rats taken to space give birth to babies back on earth thatstruggle with directions Unlike rat babies that gestated here on earth the ones that gestated in space havetrouble writing themselves when thrown into water They do tend to be better at processingorientations common during weightlessness which is a good sign for humans gestated born and raised in space but its some of the only good news Vestibular fluid isnt theonly fluid to be affected by a zeroG environmentAll of your body fluids are On earth gravity pulls those fluids down but in orbit the fluid is free to evenly distribute giving astronauts their characteristicbird legs and puffy faces Cosmetically its kind of a bummerAnd all of that new fluid pressure in your face can compromise vision Of 27astronauts studied after long space flights nine had fluid expansion around the optic nerve 6 had eyeballs flattened in the back by fluid pressure and four had bulging optic nerves More fluid pressure in your head causes an errant message that your body must have too much fluidSo the bodies of zeroG travelers respond by producing less blood Astronauts can loseup to 22 percent of their total blood volume while in space leading to weaker atrophied heartsAway from Earths protection radiation from the Sun and the rest of the universe is incredibly dangerous and were stillnot exactly sure how to best guard against it Mice exposed to levels of radiationexpected during interplanetary journeys showed signs of different brain bloodflow and larger plaques of the type found in patients with AlzheimersPsychologically feelings of isolation in spacethinking about just how far away you are from the rest of humanity can affect you physically Scientistsworking at the South Pole have developed compromised immune systems with fewer TcellsAs for the shape of your body fully grown astronauts in orbit no longer pressed down by earth typical gforce experience spinal expansion sometimes growing by asmuch as 3 percent before they come back to EarthA 6foottall human can go to space and come back as a 6foot 2inch tall person Without usual and necessary stress bones in space atrophy at a rate ofabout one percent per monthGiven enough time total bone mass lost can be as high as 40 to 60 percent And when weightless you dont need asmuch muscle strength to move around This causes the muscles ofpeople weightless in space to atrophy Those that you use to fight gravity canshrink 5 percent per month for total muscle mass loss of 20 percent Its all kind of scary and sad But dont bother crying over it because without 1G to pull them down tears dont work the same way in space Astronaut Chris Hadfield makes excellentvideos about how things happen differently in orbit For instance tears just poolupon your face due to surface tension In space you can cry but as he says the tears dont fallWe know that these problems exist for adults in spaceTheoretically they would affect developing children in space even more so Parallels have been drawn between theway a child skeleton would likely develop in orbit and diseases that cause weak and soft bones here on earthBones that break and heal according to different forces than thetypical downward ones like Rickets Its tenable to say thatwithout proper precautions exercise and care like adult astronauts already take children developing in space could look like this Not because of Rickets or a lack of vitamin D but because the usual forces and activeuse required for healthy bone development just wouldnt be thereAdded to the other threats imagine a body shaped like this but with thinner legs thin weak muscles a puffier face poor eyesight and a higher thanusual proclivity to dementia later in life Doesnt sound very good does itRemember though that a lot of this is speculationFew studies have been done on the topic and few are planned for the futureWe dont even know if a healthy fetus can develop in the first place or if conception can even occur in space When I think about how little we knowabout our bodies and how our bodies might grow anddevelop in the larger universe beyond earth I like to think about planktonThese little guys live in the ocean and they exist in staggering numbers Many varieties are too small to even see individually but collectively they can be seen from space Its estimated that there are moreplankton in the oceans of Earth than there are stars in our galaxyMore plankton on Earth than there are galaxies in the observable universeAnd these guys wonder around at the whim of ocean currents Theyre wanderers In fact they get theirname from the Greek word for wanderer a name that they share with objects seen wondering in the skyPlanets Plankton on a planetWanderers on a wandererMaybe like ocean plankton we humans aredestined to wander far and wide eventually also becoming more numerous than the stars in our galaxyIts within the realm of what we can achieve But before we start feeling too excited too proud keep in mind that we know very little about how our bodies grow and develop outside of this wanderer this planet And even though we know a lot of older words that sound like body fundamentally we dont even know why wecall these things bodies in the first place And as always thanks for

Why Do We Kiss?,2013-05-01T00:32:35Z,12.266666666666667,29819039,436359,Hey Vsauce Michael here Attachment of two peoples lips kissing The average person will spend about 20160 minutes of his or her life kissing And the worldrecord for the longest continuous kiss is 58 hours 35 minutes and 58 secondsBut why do we kiss I mean if you think about it it seems kindof weirdright I mean sure today kissing represents peace respect passion loveBut when the first two people in human history kissed were they just kind of being grossWell lets begin with what we do know kissing feels good and its good for you A passionate kiss burns about 23 caloriesper minute and releases epinephryn and norepinephryn into the blood making your heart pump fasterKissing more often is correlated with a reduction of bad cholesteral and perceivedstress But these positive effects didnt become widespread by accident Why did brainsand bodies that love kissing become so common Well a popular story holds it that Pacmansshape was inspired by the shape of a pizza with a slice missing But Toru Iwatani thecreator of Pacman admitted that this was only halftrue Pacmans shape was also inspiredby rounding out the shape of the Japanese character for mouth And its mouths andPacmans favorite activity eating which together bring us closer to the heart of the kiss Evolutionary psychologists have argued thatwhat we know today as kissing may have come from kissfeeding the exchange of prechewedfood from one mouth to another Mother birds are famous for doing this and many primatesare frequently seen doing it as well Not that long ago it was common between humanmothers and their children In fact before commercially produced or DIY babyfood instructionswere readily available it made a lot of sense Recently Alicia Silverstone uploaded a clipof herself mouth feeding her child It seemed strange to some people but even though yeahit exchanges saliva which like any contact with an infant can transfer pathogens healthymothers and healthy children can benefit from the fact that kiss feeding provides nutrientsCarbohydrates proteins iron and zinc which are not always available in breast milk Plus an adult saliva can help predigest the food making vitamins like B12 easier for the baby to absorb So mouthtomouth attachment has a historyof intimacy trust and closeness Your saliva also carries information about who you areyour level of health and mucus membranes in our mouths are permeable to hormones liketestosterone making a kiss a way to tastetest a potential mate A good kiss can be biologicalevidence that your kisser might be a good mate So as a strategy for mate selection prehistoricpeople who enjoyed kissing and did it more often may have made better decisions pickedbetter mates reproduced more successfully and eventually become the norm Giving ususpeople who love kissing Any infant could have seen those benefitscoming from a mile away even though an infants vision isnt that great From birth to fourmonths babies can only focus on things about 810 inches away from their face which notsurpisingly is about the distance to their mothers face while breast feeding So faces especially those looking rightat us tend to be the very first things in our lives we can focus on and see clearlyThis might explain why we are so good at detecting faces Humans are off the charts when it comesto this in fact we tend to see faces even when there arent anyIts called pareidolia Because humans are so cooperative it makessense for us to be good at recognizing faces And more importantly detecting when someoneis looking directly at us and clearly expressing when we are looking at someone else A predator who lives by not being seen needsa gaze thats less obvious In fact research has shown that our surprisingly white sclerasthe area that borders the iris isnt just an accident but is a vital piece of humaneye morphology that makes it easier for us to ascertain the direction of someone elsesgaze at a glance We also have impressive gazedirection networksinside our brains containing individual neurons that fire when someone is staring directlyat us but that stop firing if the gaze shifts just a degree or two So yeah you can tell when youre being watchedWe humans are quite sensitive to it even those of us with Scopophobia the fear ofbeing stared at But to be sure in order for this to work the other persons gazemust be within your line of sight your field of vision that is you can see them Otherwise if the stare is coming say from behind there is no evidence that people can tellthey are being watched The Psychic Staring Effect falls withinthe realm of pseudoscience No widelyaccepted studies have ever found evidence that it existsAnecdotally whats more likely is that the very act of rubbernecking to see whos watchingcauses people to look up and for your gazes to attach But what about attachment when no one iswatching One explanation for an infants love attachment to their mother doesntinvolve vision or staring but instead food The idea is that we love our mothers becauseas soon as we are born they are a source of lifesustaining nourishment But whatif that nourishment came not from a loving mother but from a scary Wire Mother In the 1950s Harry Harlow conducted a seriesof famous but controversial experiments on monkeys at the University of WisconsinMadison Harlows findings had substantial implications on our understanding of attachmentBut by todays standards his work would largely be considered unethical In one ofhis most famous experiments Harlow separated young monkeys from their mothers as soon asthey were born and stuck them in cages with two fake mothers a soft one wrapped in cloththat did nothing and a cold mechanical mother made of wire that nonetheless did providefood But despite being a cupboard mother the young baby monkeys didnt bond with herWhen Harlow and his team scared the baby monkeys with a strange contraption the monkeys ranand clinged not to their wire source of lifesustaining nourishment but to the soft cuddly andotherwise useless clothmother This suggested that warmth and comfort wasmore important than food when it came to nurturing attachment Harlow also built a rejectingmother which used a blast of pressurized air to push baby monkeys away But instead offinding another source of comfort these monkeys clung even tighter at all times than monkeysraised without rejecting mothers And this is what blows my mind The instinct for warmthand comfort in newborn creatures is so strong it not only resists attempts to frustrateit but is paradoxically strengthened by it Eckhard Hess tested this by using electricshocks to discourage ducklings from following the object they were imprinted on But itonly strengthened the behavior and made them follow more closely than ever before Thefact that a wire mother or a rejecting mother or receiving electric shocks for attachingto your mother would cause more attachment more love more dependence seems like a paradoxBut paradoxes can teach us As Oscar Wilde put it a paradox is the truth standing onits head to attract attention And what gets our attention here is the effectuncertainty can have In 1955 AE Fisher conducted an experimenton puppies His team separated puppies into three groups Members of the first group weretreated kindly every time they approached a researcher Members of the second groupwere punished for approaching the researchers And puppies in the third group were randomlytreated kindly or punished They grew up never knowing what to expect Their worldwas not a world of kindness or punishment but rather one of uncertainty Whats really chilling is that the study foundthat that group the third group of puppies wound up being the most attached to the researchersThe third group loved the researchers the strongest and was the most dependent uponthem Guy Murchie called this the Polarity Principle stress including the mentalstress of uncertainty is an ingredient in attachment or love and perhaps even manifestationsof hatred its polar opposite somehow enhance love Uncertainty psychologically can lead tosome of the greatest feelings of attachment and dependence Good things and bad thingsin our lives often seem random and out of our control So its no surprise that weoften react with blind love and acceptance in the face of an unfair existence becausewhat else are we supposed to do We are that third group of puppies But investigating uncertainty conqueringit so as to make the best decisions possible is advantageous So over time life has favoredactivities that turn uncertainty into knowledge Not every person out there is the best matefor you but if it didnt matter which one you picked a kiss a tastetest wouldntbe necessary and it wouldnt need to feel so good or bring us so much pleasure So go out there and kiss someone today And as always thanks for watching By the way tomorrow I am

How Much Money is There on Earth?,2013-04-23T20:55:34Z,15.516666666666667,11386838,210910,Hey Vsauce Michael hereOn Earth the average piece of currency changes hands about 55 times a yearThats about once a week With that kind of turnoverits safe to say that statistically in the United States out of every 100pieces of currency one was most likely touched in the last year by someone who within the next year willcommit murder But how much cash how much physical currency is there on earth First things first how much cash is inside of bankWell according to the FBI the average successful bank robberyinvolves 10000 dollars But thats usually just currency from the tellers tills In their vaults the average bankmight have anywhere from 10000 dollars to a 100000 dollars with somelarger banks at times carrying as much as a few million in cash But what about in our homesHow much loose change do we all have scattered on dressers or lost under cushionsWell its tough to accurately figure out the exact numberand many of the estimates vary Last year Lloyds TSB announced that in the UK the average person has about £1415 just lying around A recent survey by VISAlooked at a bunch of countries and included cash left at home the office and in the carTheir figures are a tad higher but agree with the US Treasurysestimate of few years ago that the typical US household has ninety to a hundred dollars just laying around which means that if just everyone inAmerica scrounged up all of their loose change and put in one place they would have 15 billion dollarsThats enough to fund 357 more seasons of Arrested Development But we are asking about how much cash there is on the entire planetWell that amount has a special name It is called M0 Its an aggregate of all coins and banknotes DollarDaysorgs most recent estimate values this total amount considering allcurrencies in countries at just slightly over the equivalent of 5 trillion US dollarsThat number the value of all of the currency on Earth M0 is hugeBut believe it or not it represents less than 10 percent of all of the money we humans have  available to spend right awayTo explain we should look at how money is bornIn pretty much every country on Earth one of the ways new money can be born involves a central bank Now lets say that in ourcountry the bank is run by Jake from Vsauce3Hes really smart and he pays close attention to our economyIf he feels that an increase of themoney supply would help us well he can just make more money Its that easyIt doesnt need to be printed as currency to be bornThe next step involves the commercial banks like the Bank of VsauceThese are the banks that you and I use All the central bank needs to do is buysome things from these banks using the money it just made and now the commercial banks have moremoney Theres another way money can be born It involves commercial banks and gets tothe heart of our question If I go to the bank and deposit 5 pounds the bank says fantastic we will hold on to this money for you and at anytime you wantyou can withdraw or spend these 5 poundsThe thing is legally banks only need to reserve a fraction of the money that they are givenIt is known as fractional reserve banking and it pretty much happens in every countryIt means that if someone else comes alonglike say Kevin from Vsauce2 and he wants to borrow some moneysay 3 pounds the bank can lend him 3 poundsAnd now whenever he wants he can spend these 3 poundsBut heres the thing Kevin can spend 3 pounds and I can spend 5 for a total of 8 despite the fact thatthere are only 5 pounds in the bankNew money has been born And if we want to count all of thespendable money on Earth were going to need to includethis type of money the kind that fractional reserve banking createsIf we include that kind of money we are now talking about a number much larger than M0 Economists call this figure M1M1 includes all physical currencies as well as moneythat people can access quickly like money in checking accountsGlobally across all countries and all currencies M1 is estimated to be the equivalent of 25 trillion US dollars M2 is an even broader definition of money and it includes things that you cantnecessarily spend right away For instance savings accounts or CDs under a hundred thousand dollarsM2 globally is currently estimated to be theequivalent of 60 trillion US dollarsFinally M3This is a broad definition of money that includes all currencies banknotes and coinschecking accounts savings accounts small CDs and reallybig long time deposits In the American economy the FederalReserve doesnt even report this figure anymore but as a measure of eventuallyspendable wealth its real and if we consider M3 the global money supply that gives us a figure that is equivalent to 75 trillion US dollarsOf all that money how much of it is yoursWell last week over Twitter Mark Boadey introduced me toGlobal Rich List dot comEnter your salary and figure out how you stack up against everyone else on Earth By the way you can act just like a central bank and control the money supply yourself It is illegal but you can technicallyincrease the money supply by counterfeiting and you can decreasethe money supply by subtracting moneyFor instance burning itIf you burn your own money you become poorer but because youvedecrease the money supply the power of everyone elses money goes upand they become a tiny tiny bit richerOf course given the amount of money on Earth and the amount that you couldprobably get your hands on and burn your effect will be quite imperceptible One the largest amounts of cash everburned was done by KLF who in the nineties for reasons no ones still quite sure of burned a million pounds worth of cashIt took them about 2 hours to burn all of that cash andthey recorded the act on videoYou can also destroy money by eating it like the rapper Tyga didBut you probably shouldnt do that eitherbecause money is dirty A study published in Appliedand Environmental Microbiology reported that the flu virus can survive on cash for 1 hour to 2 days And other studies have found that about7 percent of cash carries viable strains of dangerous bacteria like those the cause pneumonia or thosethat come from fecesThat is a lot of germs and those germs might be high Studies have found that 92 percent of banknotes are contaminated with traces of illegal drugs typically cocaineIn London that number has been as high as 99 percent All it takes is for a few exposed bank notes to circulate normally for all of the cash to become contaminatedLocked within the fibres of a banknote theres an average of 28 micrograms of cocaine which means that in 5000 banknotes theres enough cocaine for an entire line These drug traces are nearlyimpossible to remove from bank notes so theres little risk of the drugstransferring to your skin However they can be detected by drug sniffing dogs and on more than one occasion courtshave forced police to return confiscated cash because even though drug dogs detecteddrugs on the cash thats just how cash is As if that wasnt enough cash is also not nutritiousTermites can eat cash but to us humansthe ones who love this stuff so much cash as we know it today and for that matter money doesnt really have any intrinsic value In a postapocalyptic world where nothing was stable and survival was a challenge food clean water AMO weapons antibiotics machines fuel the trade and exchange and gifting of those types of things would be our economy When what you use as money has anintrinsic value its useful in and of itself it is known as commodity money It can also include precious metals like gold whose rarity makes it likely to beaccepted by other people for goods and services Now when you cansafely store all of your commodities in one place and you dont need a defend themor lug them around everywhere representative money often makes more sense Store your valuables in a trusted place like a bank and get some slips of paper from them saying yeah I own that stuff Now you can walk aroundwith some easy to carry slips of paper and use those to buy the things that you want We are now closer to what we call money today I say closer because almost all moneythat we know of today doesnt represent any actual useful commodity anywhere on Earth This note doesntrepresent how much food or water or gold or spices or video games I have stocked up in a bank it just is money Its called fiat moneyFiat is Latin for let it be doneAnd that kind of authoritative command is exactly what gives fiat money its valueThe people who make it have decreed that it is valuable Why Just let it be doneBecause of this the value a fiat money depends oneveryone believing that the people who make it willcontinue to exist and have the authority that they already doThis means that the value of fiat money unlike other commodities can be erased by force Lets imagine that you live inAmerica and have a lot of dollars Great jobWell technically Canada could invade and declare that the USdollar will no longer be accepted at allWell shucksYou now have a bunch of paper which at best is a incomplete deck of famous American flashcardsThe important distinction here is that invading Canadians could technically erase the value of fiat money But nothing they said or did could make a commodity like gold less valuableOther countries would still be glad to take your gold and in return give you their own still valuable currenciesNo amount of force or authority or laws or rules can make acommodity like potable water any less important to drink or gold any less rareOn the other hand the value of fiat money depends on our beliefs what we thinkSo long as we all believe that fiat money is valuable it is This happens all the timeWhat we believe what we think we know can actuallycause those things to become trueActual people real objects the way the universe works and deities like Zeus can exist all by themselveswhether we know about them or believe in themBut some concepts require us to believe in themfor them to be real And if no one believes in them they literally arent trueIts called the Tinkerbell effect and the value of fiat money is anoftencited example But whats really cool is the fact thatthere are situations where our convictions can actually destroye the very thing we believe inIts called the reverse Tinkerbell effectand it describes the situation whereas more people believe something that thing actually becomes less and less trueFor example the idea that driving a car is safeAs more and more people believe this more people will go out driving and theyare likely to drive less cautiously ironically making driving less safeAnother example would be the idea that in an election your vote mattersAs more and more people believe this more people will go out and vote and the individual weight of each vote will go down It took hard work and tools to build civilization and find curesand explore our solar system but we should keep in mind that withoutdoing anything at all we are still capable of creation By merely believing in something we can make it actually truly real Other things can actually be destroyed if we merely believe in them Can you believe that And as always thanks for

How Big Can a Person Get?,2013-04-15T21:01:07Z,15.733333333333333,20579975,397521,Hey Vsauce Michael hereTen centimeters  about four inchesThis is how much taller on average people are today than they were 150 years agoBetter nutrition and medical care early in life has allowed us to bettertake advantage of the blueprints within our genesBlueprints that carry plans for just how big a healthy human being can get given an optimal environmentIn terms of height those plans rarely exceed 7 feet 6 inches But individuals with endocrine disordersfor instance a tumour near the pituitary gland in the braincan experience growth that occurs more rapidly and for a longer period of time than usualFor instance Igor Vovkovinskiy who at 7 foot 8 inches is thetallest man currently living in AmericaThe tallest living person anywhere on Earth is Sultan Kösen who at 8 foot 3 inches tall also holds the Guinness world record for largest hands and feetBut the tallest person ever officially recorded was Robert Wadlow He was the size of an average adult malewhen he entered kindergarten at the age of 5When he died in 1940 at the age of 22 he was 8 foot 11 inches tallAndre the Giant was 7 4And this is me holding a 12ounce can Heres Andre doing the sameHuman size variation is fascinating but whats the maximum biologically how big can a human getAnd more importantly how big are you really It turns out that today now in history average human height is probably quite near the genetic limitBy manipulating the very genes responsible for height we may be able to add an extra 15centimeters or so to that average but beyond that we are likely to hit a ceilingIn order to regularly produce people over 8 feet tall 244 meters those people would probably need to be a different shapeNot human shaped This is because of the squarecube law As a shape grows say tallerits volume increases at a greater rate Take a look at this cubeIf we make it 10 times larger well sure its 10 times as tallbut the area covered by its faces is 100 times larger and its volume the space within it is 1000 times larger Now since weight is connected to volume this cube only has one hundred times thecrosssectional area to support itself but one thousand times the weight to support So if you were ten times larger and still shaped like a person that isyour proportions were the same as they are now you would need to either have a skeletonmade out of something stronger than bone or bones that were monstrously thicklike way out of proportion But even if you solved the bone andmuscle strength problem there would still be a whole host ofother issues For instance your heart wouldnt scale up fast enough tokeep blood pumping throughout a body that largeAnimals can get that big because their proportionsand organs are quite different Chris Howard from Earth Unplugged tipped me off to the giant not human proportioned legs of the largest land animal ever known tohave existed with the certainty of a complete skeleton the awesomely named giraffatitan Discovered in Tanzania and now mountedin Berlins Humboldt museum it probably weighed 20 to 30 thousand kilograms The Bruhathkayosaurus may have been even larger but this is controversial because weonly have a few of its bones Estimates put this guy at 140000 kilogramsAny larger than that and in order to survive long enough to reproduce an animal would need more buoyancy tocounteract its weight than air can provideThis is one of the reasons blue whales love the water so much The heaviest blue whale ever measured by NMML weighed in at 177000 kilograms making it the heaviest animal we are aware of that has ever existedIt might be the heaviest possible because animal size is limitedby simple geometry and the gravity of our planet Theoretically humans born on Mars couldgrow a few inches taller because gravity there is only one thirdof what it is on earth The trade off of course being that theirbones and muscles wouldnt grow strong enough for them to ever visit Earth and enjoy it The point is in order to havethe same shape and proportions that we have now we cant really get that much bigger Some of the higher estimates of the upperlimit up average human height are around 7 feet tall A person who is more than 9 feettall would struggle to move around aAd up in the 12 to 15foot range it would be difficult to live very long at all But what does size mean Where do you really begin and endSo far we have been measuring people using their rigid boundariesIts a good one to use its very common but of course when I speak I can fill an entire room and when I shout I can fill city blocksThats hugeOf course my voice is not a part of my physical body Its not part of the matter that fitswithin my skin container But its relevant to the question of how big a person isHow large of an impact on their environment can a personhave using what comes directly from their bodiesWell Guy Murchie illustrated this quite well in his tome The Seven Mysteries of Life The little solid dogs are small but their sound and smell extend intoshapes and sizes no creature could even dream of filling up with their bodies on earth Lets begin with soundHow far can your loudest shout travelHow much bigger are you The volume of space within which peopleare aware that you exist when you shoutWell the loudest shout a human can make is about 88 decibels from 30 centimeters away A shout like that will die out down belowthe threshold of human hearing in our atmosphere after traveling about 5 kilometres or 3 milesA person standing downwind from you might be able to make you out a littlefurther than that but the point is in space no one can hear you screamAnd on earth from 5 kilometres away no one can hear you scream But could they see you screamReally could they see you at allWell on the surface of the earth the furthest you can see another person is the horizonIf you and another person are standing on the ground that distance is about 5 kilometers or 3 miles Any further away than thatand you will literally be hiding behind the curvature of the earthSo what about in say outer space where moving awayfrom another person doesnt mean eventually hiding behind the earthWell as an object moves farther and farther away it becomes smaller and smallerOf course the actual size of the object doesnt changeWhat does change to you is its angular sizeThis brilliant measurement describes how much space in your visual field an object takes up Imagine your visual field as a complete circle 180 degrees of which go from thehorizon in front of you to the horizon behind youSo an object with an angular size of 90 degrees would have to be big enough and close enough so as to take up allthe space from the horizon to right above youInterestingly your thumb held at an arms length away from your face takes up about one degree of your visual fieldIts size is 1 degreeThe Moon takes up about half a degree at all timesIt sometimes appears larger at the horizon but thats becauseof an illusion that AsapSCIENCE covered really well Te smallest angular size we can see with the naked eye is about one arc minute a sixtieth of a degree But given enough contrastwe can see things like Sunspots a mere 20 arc seconds across a third of a sixtieth of a degreePlugging in numbers to do the math will tell us that with perfect conditions outer space no air no obstructionsa lot of contrast because you are wearing bright white the farthest away a person could see you with their nakedeye would be about 10 to 15 kilometres Any further away than that and they willhave passed the edge of your naked eye visibility existence But do you smell thatIt might be youIf we consider the senses of other animals your smell your scent might be your largest earthly dimension You know how animals like cats and dogshave those cute little wet nosesIts called a rhinariumRhinariums allow mammals to smell really really wellThey dont just pick up molecules that float by they localize themAir cools the wet nose allowing the animal to tell the source of the smell Its the same as when you wet yourfinger and stick it in the air to tell the winds direction A Bloodhound can pick up and trace to you a scent trail that is days old making your scent imprint on the earth about as large as you can move in a couple days But the Silvertip grizzly has a sense of smell that is seven times stronger that a Bloodhound These guys can smell things from 18 miles away nearly 30 kilometresThats probably the largest bubble we could draw around you and still call you because it contains things that you omitted that can betraced back to you by other living things But if we include everything you emit well fundamentally were limited to the edges of earths atmospherebecause with the exception of a few light molecules hydrogen helium which escape into space not much else leaves Theres no medium inspace for your sound and smells to travel through Which brings us back to light The human body emits lightelectromagnetic radiation Most of it is infrared light heatBut some of it lies within the visible spectrum though its about 1000 times dimmer thanthe dimmest light the eye can seeIt seems that what little visible light you do emit is tied in some way to your circadian rhythms meaning that around 4 pm everyday you are literally visibly the brightest you will be all dayBut heres the thing about light about electromagnetic radiationIt doesnt need a medium to travel through It just keeps going out into and through space which of course brings us to Australia If youre not subscribed to Dereks channel Veritasium I dont know what youre doing with your lifeIt is amazing and he recently made a video that I havenot been able to stop thinking about The smallest possible piece of light is a photon and the human eye can kind of perceive individual photonsa bit better than chance But some frogs can see individualphotons quite well Now in his video he explains thatas you move away from the Sun its angular size gets smaller andsmaller and smaller until eventually youre so far away from the Sun that youcan no longer see it But its still there and it is still emitting light that can reach your eye except now that light has been spread so thinits not big packets of light you can see its just individual photons The Sun is still there its just less frequent Sometimes a photon hits your eye sometimes nothing and sometimes a photon again Well the same thing happens to radiation emitted by youI Skyped with Derek this afternoon and he calculated that the human bodyseen at a distance of 168000 kilometres would also be reduced to merely a few individual photons Further than that and your size would no longer get smaller it would just remain individual photons flying through space they are after all indivisibleSo your physical size is limited by geometry and biology and gravityYour vocal and fragrant size can be bigger but it still limited by the size of Earth But your light your personal glow isnt really bounded by anything The photons that you are emitting rightnow the ones that dont get absorbed by anything have no reason to ever really stop And they can continue conceivably pasteven the observable universe making you in a way completely huge and kind of immortal And as always thanks for

SPACE STRAW,2013-04-06T23:08:55Z,10.216666666666667,12915946,277175,Hey Vsauce Michael hereOur atmosphere is a thin vail of air held to earths surface by gravityWe live in it we breathe it we walk through it every day it contains all weather but yet it is almost nothingIn fact if the earth was the size of an appleour atmosphere from the ground all the way to outer space would only be about as thick as the skin of an appleAnd because our atmosphere gets thinner exponentially as you go up90 percent of our atmospheres mass at this scale could fit within a spaceas thin as just a third of an apples skinBut that shrimpy sliver of a peel would still be thousands of timesthicker than you are tall We humans are itsy bitsy dots strolling around in a skinny sky But that skinny sky does a lotThink about this What if I had a really awesome big straw and I stuck one end in the ocean and the other end out in spaceWould outer space be able to suck all the water outWe know that naked exposed veneer vacuum of space all non concealed gases in your body would be violently farted and burped out Sucked out But sucking is not attractive Instead sucking merely refers to a flow from a region of higher pressure to aregion of lower pressure In other words a vacuum cleaner in andof itself does not attract matter to itselfLike I said in my video with no title if you were to turn on a vacuum cleaner at sea levela region inside the cleaner becomes as thin as air in Denver ColoradoExternal air which is at a greater pressureis then literally pushed by its own greater pressure into the machine bringing dust and debris with itThe point is the strength of the force pushing airinto a vacuum cleaner can only be as strong as the pressure of the surrounding airHere on earth using a vacuum cleaner or even a space strawthat pressure is atmospheric pressureAt sea level about 15 pounds per square inch or 654 NewtonsThat amount of force can only push pure water up about 103 meters or 339 feetBecause outer space is not 10 meters upits more like 100000 meters up a space straw would be a terribledoomsday device for a super villain to use to get rid of our oceans Our atmosphere just isnt heavy or strong enough to push water into orbitBecause the weight of air above pushing molecules below inall directions is responsible for air pressure air lowered down exerts more pressure The air at your feetpushes with a slightly greater force than the air at your head Now across the humanbody you cant tell the difference But if an object is light enoughit can be affected by this difference which is why a helium balloon floats The air down here pushes a tiny bit morestrongly than the air up here and since the balloon is lighter thanthe same volume of air its literally pushed up by the air more strongly than gravity pulls it down This upward force caused by a surrounding fluid or gas that counteracts an objects weight is known as buoyancyNow here on the surface of the earth the buoyancy of air isnt enough tocause humans to float away or be lifted But it existsIn fact in a perfect vacuum you would weigh about a fifth of poundmore than you do right nowThanks air Back to our balloon friendHes not going to float up forever in the outer space escaping earthEventually as the atmosphere thins out and the baloon expands it will pop and fall back down to earthits helium spreading throughout the atmosphere So besides rockets that we intentionally launch off of Earth does our atmosphere ever lose anythingDoes earth ever lose anything Does Earth ever gain anything I mean I used to be smaller I used to be a little kid But all of the atoms and molecules in mybody right now simply came from things that I consumedThings that I ate or drank or breathed in When new kids are born the earth doesnt get heavier because a new baby is just a rearrangement of atoms and molecules that used to be inside its mother or molecules that she ate drank or breathed in all of which came from earthEverythings recycled so is the earth not gaining or losing mass Well to begin earth does lose some stuff For instance hydrogen and helium are a bit too light to stick around because of earthsgravity They eventually fly out into space or get picked off by solar wind at the edge of our atmospherewhich is why as Ive said before we are likely to one day run out of helium Pretty soon But the earth gains mass in some ways as wellFor instance every year its been estimated that 10 to 20 million kilograms of space dustand meteorite fragments fall to Earth making it heavier Now if you factor inthe energy that the earth radiates away which is equivalent to mass as well asthe energy the earth gets from the Sun and holds onto for instanceusing its greenhouse gases in total it has been calculated that every year earth becomes 50 million kilograms lighterThat might sound like a lot but it is only 000 0000 0000 0000 1 percent of Earths total mass which means that for all intents andpurposes the stuff that we are made of the atoms and molecules in our bodiesthe food that we eat the water that we drink our best friends has all been here since the early days of Earth including the air that you are breathing right nowRemember that six trillionkilograms of oxygen that all humans inhale every year Well each and every one of usindividually contributes by breathing about 85 million times per year Heres the thing about a breathBecause molecules are so frustratingly small a single little breath contains about 10 sextillion moleculesIn a poetic twist of symmetry Earths entireatmosphere contains a volume of air equal to about 10 sextillion breathsThe number of molecules in one breath is equal to the number of breaths ourearth has to give us that is assuming of course that we neverexhaled anything and it never got renewed which it does And because our atmosphere gets circulated so quickly and because we breathe so often andbecause molecules are so small statistically speaking our atmosphere our skinny little peel of air is crowded with molecules that weve allhad inside our bodies and been breathing To make this really mindblowinglets focus only on carbon dioxideWe dont just breathe it in and then right back out againIts a waste product that comes from all over our bodies And carbon dioxide is useful to plants which absorb it and then turn it into sugarsIt doesnt just inertly float around our atmosphere forever OkayWell it has been estimated that it takes one breath about 1 year to thoroughly mixthroughout the hemispheres of earth and about 10 years tothoroughly mix within the troposphere that we live in and the stratosphere aboveNow given that only 5 percent of what we exhale is carbon dioxide and only 20 percent of that came from metabolism within our brain even if we assume that 9999999 percent of all the  CO2 you have ever exhaled hasbeen trapped in the oceans or absorbed by plants and made into sugars it is stillmathematically certain even if you were in a brand new placeyouve never breathed in before that every breath you take contains atleast a few molecules that were once inside your brainA few of them may have been molecules that you usedfive years ago to remember where you left your keys A few of them may have been inside your brain when you first fell in loveAnd a few of them almost certainly were inside the brain of your mother while she was giving birth to youSo take a deep breath because our air is crowded with historyAnd keep breathing because within the next 10 years it is certain that I will breathe in a few carbon dioxide molecules that are inside your brain right now as you listen to me say that As always thanks for

What If The Sun Disappeared?,2013-03-31T14:11:41Z,11.716666666666667,20104957,389422,Hey Vsauce Michael here Gravity is a property of matter anythingwith mass This includes the Moon Earth Jupiter the Sun and even you  your bodyIn fact if you kinda like somebody have them stand 34 of a millimeter away from youAt that distance cumulatively every atom in your body and every atom in their bodywill draw you two together with the same gravitational force that the Sun is exerting on you right now Of course we dont feel either of those forcesbecause compared to the gravitational influence of the Earth they are basically nothingYou dont need to concern yourself with the gravitational attraction between you and someone yourehugging or your individual body and the Sun 150 million kilometres awayIn fact the Sun may as well not exist What if the Sun disappeared Well to be sure its not going to happenThe Sun will die billions of years from now by expanding boiling off our oceansand swallowing the Earth whole The Sun is not going to simply disappearMatter and energy dont vanish Of course matter can quantum tunnel to different locationsbut on the scale of the Sun there is not enough time in the lifetime of millions andbillions of universes for such a probability to even be worth discussing But lets discuss it anyway as a thoughtexperiment to determine how the Earth would get along with no SunWhat will the Earth do and what can it do alone At the exact moment that the Sun disappearedwe would have no idea Because it takes light from the Sun 8 minutes and 20 seconds toreach Earth So for a little over 8 minutes after the Sun disappeared we would have noidea Once we did confusion and mass panic would most likely ensue The Suns gravitational grasp on our planetwould also take 8 minutes and 20 seconds to end This is because gravity waves propagateat the speed of light So the very moment we saw our Sun disappear we would also loseits gravitational influence and Earth would fly out in a straight linetangent to wherever it was in its orbit The finite speed of light and gravity meanthat as panic and fear spread across the Earth at the loss of our Sun we could still fora while look up into the sky and see our planetary buddies further out continuing to operateas if nothing had happened For instance Jupiter would continue orbitingand reflecting light from a Sun that no longer existed for about 30 minutes after the Earthalready knew the Sun was gone And depending on where Jupiter was in its orbit it wouldtake another 30 minutes to an hour for us to watch the reflected light of Jupiter snuff out With no moonlight or sunlight the universeitself would be our only source of visible light from space In 2004 Abdul Ahad calculated that the MilkyWay contributes about as much light as 1300th of a full Moon So there would be enough lightfrom space for us to see around a bit But of course electricity and fossil fuels wouldstill be usable for a while So cities and towns could continue to be lit by manmadesources just like a typical night except it would be night everywhere Photosynthesis would stop immediately andthis is huge I had a great discussion about this video with Henry from MinutePhysicsand the new channel MinuteEarth If youre not subscribed to MinuteEarth you definitely should be In one of his episodes there he mentionsthat 999 of the natural productivity on Earth is done by photosynthesis which requiresthe Sun Without the Sun plants would no longer be able to inhale carbon dioxide andexhale lifesustaining oxygen But dont worry Collectively all of ushumans all 7 billion of us breathe in about 6 trillion kilos of oxygen every yearBut our atmosphere contains a whopping quintillion kilos of oxygen So even without photosynthesisand including all the other animals and insects and microorganisms that consume oxygenit would take us thousands of years to run out The poor plants themselves would be muchworse off Without the Sun most of them would die within days or weeks Except for largeplants Giants trees for instance contain enough sugar for energy that they could technicallylive in the dark for years Their problem is going to be that the Earth will get quitecold In fact mighty trees would freeze to death Their blood the water and sap insideof them solidify way before they died of starvation Right now with our Sun the average surfacetemperature on Earth hot places and cold places and different seasons all consideredis an arguably comfortable 14 to 15 degrees Celsius Without the Sun to add energy the Earth wouldradiate away heat exponentially meaning it would go fast at first and then happenmore and more slowly By the end of the first week without the Sun the average surfacetemperature across Earth would be freezing Zero Celsius 32 degrees Fahrenheit Now temperatures like this happen all the time on Earth were used to it Panic and fear and looters and anarchy aside for the first few days or months we could get by But by the end of the first year withoutthe Sun the average global surface temperature would be 73 degrees Celsius 100 Fahrenheit The best option really would be to moveto geothermal areas like Yellowstone or Iceland These places would be the few safe havensfor human life after the Sun Nearly all life on Earth exists because of and is dependentupon extraterrestrial energy the Sun But the Earth produces its own heat Despite floatingin the coldness of space for billions of years down below the crust the Earth is quite warm 20 of this warmth came from the fact thatwhen the Earth formed mass crushed so tightly in the middle that the pressure liquified rockThe other 80 of Earths internal heat comes from that fact that deep in its coreradioactive elements decay providing the energy needed to keep the Earths core at5000 degrees Celsius Anyone who failed to secure a position withinone of these bastions of warmth or perhaps underground in a community warmed and poweredby nuclear fuel would likely be dead within the first year of no Sun In the next 10 or 20 years things would startto get wet with dew But not with glorious water droplets Instead droplets of liquid airThe air would literally become cold enough for the gasses that make it up to condenseor form clouds and precipitate first as rain and then as it got colder and coldereventually as snow In Fritz Leibers famous sciencefiction shortstory A Pail of Air this has already happened The Earth was ripped away from the Sun andin order to survive a family must go outdoors in a special suit and scoop up a pale of justthe oxygen snow bring it back in and place it over a fire to warm and allow them to breathe A year or so after the sun disappeared Earthsoceans will have frozen over Ice all the way across But ice is less dense than liquidwater which means that ice floats And ice is a pretty decent insulatorSo for billions of years after the Sun disappeared liquid water could still exist at the bottom of ouroceans protected and insulated from space by miles of ice above it and warmed by ventson the ocean floor that spew water out super heated by Earths interior This would continue on Earth for a very verylong time  Sun or no Sun Instead of becoming frozen and lifeless extremophiles like microbesthat live around hydrothermal vents deep in the ocean would be fine They live deep inthe ocean far below the point where sunlight can penetrate and they make energy not throughphotosynthesis but via chemosynthesis  converting heat and methane and sulphur into the energythey need They are then eaten by clams and tubeworms Extremophiles deposit minerals back into thevents meaning that their food chain is complete Its a circle Its independent of the SunEarthlings like them would thrive if the Sun were to disappear They would live just finewithout every knowing that the Sun was gone Or honestly without ever even knowing itexisted in the first place Its amazing to think that life here on Earthall alone flying through space with no Sun would kind of be fine Far from becoming afrozen dead rock or a boring dormant seed the Earth would be a spaceship carrying livingpassengers with enough geothermal heat for billions of years of life If the Sun disappeared spaceship Earth wouldfly out in a straight line covering about 30 kilometres every single second After just 1 billionyears it will have covered 900 quadrillion kilometres or about 100000 lightyears  a trip thatcould potentially take it all the way across our galaxy near thousands of starsAnd nothings to say it couldnt fall into orbit around one thaw out and allow its stillliving extremophilesto proliferate life on Earth all over again maybe one day developing life intelligentenough to uncover whatever is left of our livesMaybe they could even find this very video In which case hi uh youre welcome for this video about your planets history and journey And um as always  thanks for

Why Do We Play Games?,2013-03-23T22:15:12Z,12.2,8024927,175595,Hey Vsauce Michael here Why do humans play gamesWhether its a video game or a board game or a physical game like soccer  or footballI dont have to put the ball in the net to survive and even if I did whywould I invite a goalie and another team Games are weird This lead Bernard Suits tosay in the 70s that a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstaclesSo why do we play sports and games How should we feel about intellectualism vs athleticismBut most importantly why do Americans call this game soccer while the English and therest of the world call it football It turns out that the word soccer doesntcome from the United States of America Instead the blame for the word goes to the Britishthemselves specifically Oxford where since 1875 it has been popular to add the suffixer to the end of words For example calling Radcliffe Camera the Radderor these fivers and tenners We have been playing games with balls andour feet ever since ancient times all over the world In fact as recently as 200 yearsago many of these games called themselves football A lack of standardization meantthat it was difficult to all come together and agree on what you could and couldnt dowith the ball or your feet But luckily in 1863 the Football Association was foundedin London England Association football is what we most commonly mean nowadays when talkingabout football or soccer But whats the connection if the Oxford er was added to Associationfootball shouldnt we be calling the game Associationer Well lets take a closerlook at the word association You see whats hiding in there There she is Soccer But were getting ahead of ourselves becausesoccer football is just one type of game Ultimately what is a game Well one of myfavorite ways of defining game comes from computer game designer Chris CrawfordLets begin with a book This is a great book its really fun its entertaining but its not a gameTV shows and movies are also not games because fundamentally they arent interactiveBut as soon as something is both fun and interactive well now weve got ourselvesa plaything There are two types of playthings according to Crawford If you can play withthe object and its fun but theres no goal or objective associated with it its a toyIf however there is an objective something youre supposed to accomplish well now youretalking about a challenge But there are two different types of challenges If the challengeinvolves no other people or other agents its just you for instance playing alonewith a Rubiks Cube youve got yourself a puzzle If however there are other peopleinvolved well now weve got ourselves a conflict In a conflict like a foot race you arentallowed to interfere with the other participants This is what Crawford calls a competitionIf however you are allowed to interact with and interfere with the other players andthey can do the same to you well in that case we are talking about a fullfledged game So a game is interactive goalorientedand involves other agents for instance other people who can interfere with and influenceeach other Which means technically speaking that life is a game I mean real lifeMy life your life easily fit many definitions of game And in life there are games thatwe tend to call sports Now competency at sports can divide humanity into two groupsJocks who are good at sports and nerds who arent Jocks are literally named afterthe Jock Strap which keeps your genitals supported while being athleticBut jocks are cool right Theyre fit attractive they get invited to all the cool parties wherein high school they can do dangerous cool things like get drunk And who are you ifyou dont get drunk Well whats the word drunk backwards You are a KnurdBut thats not the origin of the word nerd Theres much debate about where the word comesfrom but what we do know is that it emerged as a slang term for lame or square inDetroit in the early 1950s The first known use of the word in print camefrom Dr Seuss himself and fundamentally it may come from the word nut which meanta crazy person and was later altered to nert and finally nerd It exists today as a wordfor unathletic people largely because it was popularized through its frequent use onthe US TV show Happy Days Whether your spend your time on athletic pursuitsor intellectual pursuits or both games in some form are a part of your lifeSo why do we play games Humans and many other animals play And perhaps play originatedas a way of physically preparing our bodies for lifes real challenges later on Thatidea makes sense but the evidence isnt convincing because in the wild play can often leadto a wasting of precious resources injuries and hardly comes close to simulating realattacks and lifethreatening situations The New York Times wrote a great article aboutthis conundrum pointing out that physically preparing the body may be less of a priorityfor play Instead the point of play might be preparing the brain Play is good for thebrain especially during formative juvenile years when most of us have an instinctive urgeto goof around play and pretend anyway Young rats confined to cages with adult ratswho refused to play with them grew up with smaller less developed brains This has ledto the hypothesis that games play a role in the development of certain brain structuresespecially the cerebellum when we are young But to be clear the evidence does not showthat play is vital for the development of these regions Other methods like exercisesor teaching may have a similar effect They might not be as fun but this is knownas equifinality So theres debate as to just how vital play and games really areWell lets take a look at the rewards that games give us In the first half of the 20th century AbrahamMaslow constructed a hierarchy of human needs The concept is popular in developmental psychologyas a way of thinking about human growth and what motivates us to do things or to notdo things In general until the needs of a lower tier are fulfilled an individualcant move on to fulfilling higher ones For instance achieving confidence or satisfyingthe desire to learn and explore arent important to a person in fear for their life and safetyPlay might be motivated by higher needs Animals play but as weve seen in nature not theones who are stressed or starving The thing is lower needs tend to be prettyclear cut If Im hungry and I eat what I need Im done Its not that complicatedBut as creatures and brains and cultures become more complicated so do their needsand the behaviors required to fulfill them This brings us back to the fact that lifeitself fits Chris Crawfords definition of a game Arguably life is the largest andmost complicated game on Earth But playing your life usually isnt as easy as simplyremembering to eat and drink and breath In life knowing what the correct next moveis isnt always easy Feedback is rarely immediate I dont know if the choices I made were thebest most perfect choices for me until way after Ive made them if even thenIs this person or city or career right for me In life the rules are complicated the goalsare indeterminate and the methods for achieving them are often unknown or different for everysingle person Plus the rewards themselves are often slow to come or nonexistent So in the face of all of that its no surprisethat we invented games within the larger game of life itself that ensure fast easytoachieveand understandable rewards Animals play too but the complexity of ruleshumans follow in their games in many ways reflect the complexity of the needs we findourselves able to pursue In life I dont always know the right choiceI dont know the right job to apply for How to explain something to a child How to best help my friends or when to call my mom But in Bomberman I know exactly what every powerupdoes every time all the time In poker a royal flush beats twoofakindno question about it Couldnt be more clear But in my life is an acquaintance or colleaguereally on my side Well in team sports theres no unknown everyone is colorcoded Games and sports are a phenomenal way to feelthe rewards we need without all of the unknowns of life Even watching games and sports merelybeing a spectator can fulfill some of Maslows needs I can feel a sense of belonging bysupporting a team and by supporting a team their successes can kind of become my successes What a great way to get respect without doinga lot of work Its known as BIRGing Basking In Reflected Glory The opposite is CORFingCutting Off Reflected Failure If a team is disgraced I can easily say I was not reallyever that big of a fan anyway BIRGing and CORFing extend beyond sportsWe BIRG and CORF workplace projects school projects celebrities election candidatesThe point is life is a game but winning and losing are nebulous So we invented simplergames to provide psychological rewards faster and more efficiently than life itself doesWhich is why at their darkest games can lead to procrastination or addiction But dont fear You have the potential tobecome a jock at the game of life its just not always that fun And whenever you playmanmade games rest assured that its simply because you and all of us are able to pursuethe fulfillment of needs higher than any other creature on Earth And as always thanks for

Why Do We Wear Clothes?,2013-03-14T00:45:50Z,9.7,14793402,374776,Hey Vsauce Michael here Why do humans wear clothing Sure we need it for protection from theelements and fashion to show our personalities but no other animal makes and wears clothing More importantly why do we feel embarrassedto be naked around other people The word embarrassed comes from  the Portuguese route embaraça which means to entangle or entwine And feeling embarrassed oftenfeels like being tied up or exposed But how can a healthy amount of embarrassment be a sign that you are likeable forgivable and trustworthy This tshirt and hoodie come from the YouTube Space LA which opened in November of 2012 But clothing has been around a lot longer than that for at least the last 100000 years Clothing protects us from the cold from rain from the Sun and it can also be an ornament A way of accentuating certain partsof our bodies or showing off wealth status It can even help us build our own identities But today Iminterested in another use of clothing modesty Why are humans afraid to be naked Why are we ashamed of nudity Especially because animals pretty muchwalk around naked all the time Why arent animals embarrassed to be naked Well Lets take a closer look at embarrassment Embarrassment is a fascinating emotion and an extremely social one You dont ever really ever feel embarrassedalone when no ones watching you or listening to youSo embarrassment probably evolved becauseit is such a good influence on social cooperation We feel embarrassed when we violate little social rules of conduct and each of usindividually hoping to avoid that to avoid embarrassment has helped all of us live together better Healthy brains experience embarrassment Neurodegeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes can lead to less awareness of yourself So a healthy amount of occasional embarrassment is a good thing Its a sign of a socially adept and normally functioning brain A famous experiment involved participants watching an actor receive praise for achieving a very very high score on an exam In some cases the actor was told to feign pride in the achievementAnd in others they acted embarrassed to have attention put on themselves Later the actors and the participants played games together and the participants were more prosocial friendly and cooperative with actors who earlier expressed embarrassment Its suggested that the actor was to betrusted that they desired to fit in and work together Now the fact that embarrassment displaysour knowledge of others and our desire to be liked may explain why evoking embarrassmentin others whether it be flirtation or playful teasing is so common when we kind of like the other person Shame is a stronger emotionAnd shame when it comes to our private parts the kind nearly everysociety  western or not  shares to some degree is related to the root of our question today modesty Havelock Ellis writing on theevolution of modesty is a big antiquated when it comes to vocabularybut he discusses quite well two possible reasons for our fear of nakedness both of which predate clothing andare not unique to humans The first is the vital phenomenon of refusal Before mating many animals play a game of chase hard to get a game of acceptance and then flight forcing the pursuer to keep up and prove their determination before being chosen as a desirable mateSo when it comes to humans we can think of clothing paradoxically as both a means of drawing attention to ones body and simultaneously as a way to cover the body modestly making us less available to everyand any potential mate rendering breeding more selective Ellis also mentions the fear of evoking disgustAnd its easy to see why individuals of a species who avoid thingswe consider disgusting would survive better Fecal material waste rubbish otherbodily secretions can spread disease For instance animals whose poop likely containsdangerous parasites avoid grazing around or hanging out around their waste Habits like that lead to more sanitary conditions and a species more likely to survive Its a satisfying piece ofevidence as to why clothing once invented was so quickly used to cover private areas In 2009 the BBCinvestigated another influential factor   raising children In species where the young are bornpretty much ready for life it makes more sense to spend your time making babies as opposed to sitting around raising themThey dont need it Super precocial animals like the megapodehatch with full flight feathers and can fly on their own within hours of hatching Human babies on the other handare pretty darn altricial We are born barely able to do much besides swallowfood put directly into our mouths Newborns cant walk or talk orcook meals for themselves or drive themselves to work Its ridiculous Why are human babies born so unready for life Why is so much development time stillneeded after human kids are born Well one explanation is that itsbecause we are so brilliant Brain size is correlated with the body sizeBigger bodies require bigger brains The shrew has a smaller brain than a humanbut us humans have smaller brains than walesOf course a bigger brain is not indicative of intelligence For one thing larger animals literallyjust have more cells they need to worry about and control What matters more when it comes tointelligence is the proportion of brain size to body size Compared to the size of our bodies our brains are gigantic theyre outliers theyre off the charts Its crazy And a consequence of this isthat in order to to have a brain as big as ours come out of a mother as small as a human we have to come out with brainsthat arent fully formed Brains and heads that arent as big as they will eventuallygrow to be And this is why human babies require so much care and so muchtime to develop before their brains are ready for them to go off on their own Under this theory being naked andmating all of the time might be a little bit less of apriority for humans Humans and societies that privilege modesty would have more timeand resources to put toward raising children and avoiding extra matesinstead of just conceiving more kids allowing kids to develop properly and reproduce themselves Clothing serves this purpose quite well It conceals the privates and allowsmore time to be spent on other things Clothes clothing may in a way actually be a consequence of our unique intelligence So the next time you put on clothes keep in mind that one of the reasonsyoure not running out into the world buttnaked is because you have such a big brain No matter how dumb the clothing is that youre putting on its a reminder that we are smart And as always thanks for watching Kevin thank you for

Should You Eat Yourself?,2013-03-05T02:23:02Z,7.533333333333333,14518441,365367,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd Jake And Kevin And we are in Santa Monica which of course means that the V in Vsaucewill stand for the Roman numeral five as in five questions from you guys Our first question comes from notch He didnt ask this of me in particularbut I love how nonintuitive the answer isAssume an Earth thats perfectly spherical and a rope stretched around the equator snugly What would happen if that rope was justsay six meters longer Six meters isnt very much but because of the relationshipbetween a circumference and a radius six meters of extra rope would allow theentire rope to not fit snugly around the earth but one meter above it all the way around Thats cool but what if instead of a rope we used something more rigid like a structure a bridge and we built the bridge all the way around the Earth And then all at once destroyed its supports Would it floatClearly the earths gravity would pull the structure down but down is in the opposite directionfor the other side of the bridge Well it turns out such a scenario would be incrediblyunstable Earths gravity isnt equal everywhere and if you follow tweetsauceyou saw some great graphs showing just how much gravity changes simply based on the density of rock below When you factor in the Sun and the Moonyou wind up with a bridge structure that is not gonna stay where it isIf the bridge itself was indestructible it would start violently hula hooping around theearth crushing things But theres no known material strong enough to do thatInstead you would wind up with bridge pieces flying everywhere A sphere around the earth would be a bitmore stable but a ring Not so much The ring even if spinning would rapidlybreak apart into smaller pieces Last week you guys asked me a questionthat I have always wondered Lets say I was stranded in themountains waiting for rescuers to arrive but it was going to take a whileI had plenty of snow and plenty of water but I was hungry  dying of starvation  would it make sense to amputate one of my legs and eat itI mean it kinda makes sense right Id have my entire leg to eat as foodwhich would probably fill me up and I would have one less limb that I would need to keep alive The only problem is that the trauma yourbody would endure from the loss of a limb would greatly exceed the benefit you would getby eating the food Youre better off keeping that limb on your body because your bodys process of usingreserves of energy is more efficient than the process of digestionSo keep the leg on and let it wither away keeping you aliveDont cut it off and eat it and digest it How does hair know when to stop growing Its a good question because the hair on my arm which theres a lot of never grows any longer than this And if I were shave my arm offit would grow back and stop right where it is right now But head hair is different For instance my hair  whats left of it would keep growing if I didnt cut it But no other animal has that situationYou dont see wolves out in the forest saying wow look how long my hair isgetting I better get to the barber shop So why do humans have head hair that grows so long but body hair elsewhere that stopsseemingly right when its supposed to Well first things first The hair on your head will not keep growing for ever Typically around six years of growth is the limit When hair grows it is in what is known as itsanagen phase And for hair on your head that phase can last up to six years But the anagen phase of hair elsewhereon your body  eyebrows eyelashes  is much shorter Except in cases like this guy whoseeyebrows grove like head hair and have allowed him to set the world record for longest eyebrows Humans probably lost their fur coatstheir thick body hair because it didnt really help us huntingand running around sweating on the savannah And unlike other animalsus humans had discovered fire and could make clothing to keep ourselves warmwithout needing a builtin fur coat To be sure long hair that falls overyour ears and neck can keep you warmer But leading theories also arguethat long head hair may be our fault A result of the fact that early humans picked mates that could grow longer hair on their heads Mates that could do that were probably healthier and in colder climates literally had a builtin hat to keep their body warm One of the questions I get the mostis about eye floaters Those little dots or squiggles that you see in your vision especially when looking at a bland scene like the clear blue sky Eye floaters are made out of little fibralsthat occur in your eye as you age And you cant look directlyat them because theyre inside the fluid of your eye Turning your eye to lookat them simply causes the fluid to move and the floater as wellBut the thing about eye floaters that I love the most is that they are almost always microscopic You cant see them with the naked eye except when they are inside your eye If you were to pull an eye floater outyou wouldnt be able to see it But in your eye its close enough to the retina to leave a shadow on the retina andthats what you see when you see eye floaters Finally how much would Wikipedia weight if i printed all the text out and bound it into booksWell luckily theres a Wikipedia article about this very topic The Englishlanguage Wikipedia containsabout two billion three hundred and forty five million words which if printed at the density of theEncyclopedia Britannica would equal about 1759 volumes Which would look like this Altogether they would weigh about 7000 pounds If youre between the ages of 13 and 18 you may want to check out the Google Science Fair Its an amazing competitionThese guys are great They actually helped make that Earth bridge animation for me So be sure to check out GoogleScienceFaircom And Ill keep checking out Los AngelesIm here with Kevin and Jake from Vsauce2 and 3 for the first time ever The three of

Is Your Red The Same as My Red?,2013-02-17T13:40:19Z,9.583333333333334,31731556,743597,Hey Vsauce Michael here This appears blue This appears yellowAnd this appears green Those of us with normal color vision can probably agreeBut that doesnt change the fact that color is an illusion Color as we know it does not exist in theoutside world beyond us like gravity or protons do Instead color is created insideour heads Our brains convert a certain range of the electromagnetic spectrum into colorI can measure the wavelength of radiation but I cant measure or observethe experience of a color inside your mind So how do I know that when you and me lookat a strawberry and in my brain this perception occurs which I call red that in yourbrain a perception like this doesnt occur which you have of course also learned tocall red We both call it red We communicate effectively and walk away never knowing justhow different each of our internal experiences really were Of course we already know that not everybodysees color in exactly the same way One example would be color blindness But we can diagnoseand discuss these differences because people with the conditions fail to see things that most of us can Conceivably though there could be ways ofseeing that we use that cause colors to look differently in different peoples minds withoutaltering their performances on any tests we could come up with Of course if that were the case wouldntsome people think other colors look better than others Or that some colors were morecomplimentary of others Well yeah but doesnt that already happen This matters because it shows how fundamentallyin terms of our perceptions we are all alone in our minds Lets say I met an alien from a far away solarsystem who lucky enough could speak English but had never and could never feel painI could explain to the alien that pain is sent through A delta and C fibers to the spinalchord The alien could learn every single cell and pathway and process and chemicalinvolved in the feeling of pain The alien could pass a biology exam about pain andbelieve that pain to us generally is a bad thing But no matter how much he learned the alienwould never actually feel pain Philosophers call these ineffable raw feelings QualiaAnd our inability to connect physical phenomenon to these raw feelings our inability to explainand share our own internal qualia is known as the Explanatory Gap This gap is confrontedwhen describing color to someone whos been blind their entire life Tommy Edison has never been able to seeHe has a YouTube channel where he describes what being blind is like Its an amazing channelIn one video he talks about colors and how strange and foreign of a concept it seemsto him Sighted people try to explain for instance that red is hot and blue is coldBut to someone who has never seen a single color that just seems weird And as he explainsit has never caused him to finally see a color Some philosophers like Daniel Dennett arguethat qualia may be private and ineffable simply because of a failure of our own languagenot because they are necessarily always going to be impossible to share There may be an alien race that communicatesin a language that causes colors to appear in your brain without your retina having tobe involved at all Or without you having to have ever needed to actually see the coloryourself Perhaps even in English he says given millions and billions of words usedin just the right way it may be possible to adequately describe a color such that ablind person could see it for the first time Or you could figure out that onceandforallyes or no in fact you and your friend do not see the same red But for now it remains the case that wehave no way of knowing if my red is the same as your red Maybe one day our language willallow us to share and find out or maybe it never will I know its frustrating tonot have an answer but the mere fact that you guys can ask me about my internal experiencesand the mere fact that I can ask my friends and we can all collectively wonder at theconcept of qualia is quite incredible and also quite human Animals can do all sorts of clever thingsthat we do They can use tools problem solve communicate cooperate exhibit curiosityplan for the future and although we cant know for sure many animals certainly actas if they feel emotions  loneliness fear joy Apes have even been taught to use languageto talk to us humans Its a sort of sign language that theyve used to do everythingfrom answer questions to express emotion or even produce novel thoughts Unlike anyother animal these apes are able to understand language and form responses at about the levelof a 25 year old human child But there is something that no signingapehas ever done No ape has ever asked a question Joseph Jordanias Who Asked the First Questionis a great read on this topic and its available for free online For as long as weve been able to use signlanguage to communicate with apes they have never wondered out loudabout anything that we might know that they dont Of course this does not mean that apes andplenty of other animals arent curious They obviously are But what is suggests is thatthey lack a Theory of Mind An understanding that other people have separate mindsThat they have knowledge access to information that you might not have Even us humans arentborn with a theory of mind and theres a famous experiment to test when a human childfirst develops a theory of mind It is called the SallyAnne test During the test researchers tell childrena story about Sally and Anne Sally and Anne have a box and a basket in their roomThey also happen to have a delicious cookie Now Sally takes the cookie and puts it insidethe box and then Sally leaves the room While Sally is gone Anne comes over to the boxtakes the cookie out and puts the cookie inside the basket Now when Sally comes backthe researchers ask the children where will Sally look for the cookie ObviouslySally will look in the box Thats where she left it She has no way of knowing what Annedid while she was gone But until the age of about 4 children will insist that Sallywill check the basket because after all thats where the cookie is The child sawAnne move the cookie so why wouldnt Sally also know Young children fail to realizethat Sallys mental representation of the situation her access to informationcan be different than their own And apes who know sign language but neverask us questions are doing the same thing Theyre failing to recognize that other individualshave similar cognitive abilities and can be used as sources of information So we are all alone with our perceptionsWe are alone in our own minds We can both agree that chocolate tastes good But I cannotclimb into your consciousness and experience what chocolate tastes like to you I can neverknow if my red looks the same as your red But I can ask So stay human stay curiousand let the entire world know that you are

A Defense of Comic Sans,2013-02-11T18:21:27Z,9.883333333333333,9692746,274054,Hey Vsauce Michael hereText The printed wordVitally important but never nakedWhen words and letters are printedthey have to wear the clothing of a typeface A font familyWe dont always think of it this way but you cannot type without using a typeface Even right now here on YouTubewhen you leave a comment you are communicating your own wordsyour own thoughts but through the visual styling of someone else  the creator up ArialIn these Vsauce videos Jake Kevin myself and others use Alsina because it most closely resembles the handwritingof Nik Guinta the creator of the Vsauce logo Now thinking of typefaces as fashion for letters is not a new idea Adrian Frutiger famously saidthat the work of a type designer is just like the work of dressmakerOr as Alan Fletcher put it a typeface is an alphabet in in a straitjacketSome typefaces have serifs and some dontSome are famously neutral while others are silly or ugly But one typeface is so silly and so ugly and so popular that it has arguably become the most hated font of all time Comic SansPeople who consider themselves discerning designers scoff at its ubiquity usually wielded by amatures who dont know betterIt was recently reported that on Twitter the only thing complainedabout more often than Justin Bieber but less frequently than airlines is Comic SansOnline you can play a Kill Comic Sans gameAnd the website Ban Comic Sans provides a gigantic list of handwritten looking fontsthat they would prefer you use insteadComic Sans is so hated its almost pulled a 360 and is cool again ironicallyDavid OReillys amazing tshirts for example But irony isnt the only thing Comic Sans has going for itThe British Dyslexia Association considers Comic Sans a particularly good font for childrenwho have trouble reading letters because of its easily distinguishable characters like the letter AFor most of our history books and signs had to be hand written often meticulously and expensively copied by handThere were no printers no typesetters If you wanted a book someone had to literally write by hand the whole book for you But Gutenberg changed that by popularizing interchangeable typeHe modelled his tight pieces after the handwriting of scribes at the timeproducing what could be called the very first font ever textura Later on typesetters in Italy realizedthat words could be slanted and remain legible and readable but take up less vertical spaceso more could be printed on a single pageThats why its called italics Not because italics means slanted or oblique  but because of where it was invented  ItalyMetal type pieces had to be cast from molten metal in foundries which get their name from the French fondue which means something that has been melted And so its because of the word fondue thatwe now call a collection of characters within a typeface a fontWhen setting type typesetters kept their type pieces in cases The most commonly used pieces were keptin the lower case for easy access whereas capitals were kept just a little above in the upper caseBack to Comic SansComic Sans was designed in 1994 by Vincent ConnareAccording to the BBC Melinda Gates herself asked Connare to design a font for the cartoon dog in Microsoft Bob to speak inAnd so within three days Connare had designed Comic Sansbased on hand drawn fonts from comic booksIt never actually made it into the final version of Microsoft Bob but was subsequently released as a fontchoice on so many Microsoft products that it became what it is todayMillion of amateurs now had access to this font which seemed simple and cute and becamepopular on things like homemade birthday cards but also in less appropriate situations For instance on an official Canadian coin or on a gravestone Because of things like that Comic Sans has amassed a lot of hatersBut it was never intended to be used so often or in such inappropriate situations And so in reality the fault may lie with us the typers Comic Sans doesnt disappoint people People disappoint people Another way to think of it is thisDiscerning type aficionados may recognize Comic Sans so quickly because it is a threatType design is a specialized discipline but now anybody with a computer can take a stab at it without your approvalThey dont need youTo be sure Comic Sans objectively speaking isnt really that well designedaccording to the fundamentals of type design David Kadavy has a brilliantexplanation of this in his Why You Hate Comic SansHe points out that its unbalanced and not very well kerned Comic Sans is certainly not a calculated precise font liked TrajanBut its not organic like real handwritingInstead it lies within the uncanny valleyThis concept often comes up in robotics The more human something getsthe cuter it becomes and the more we like ituntil its almost human but not quiteAt this point things become creepy almost scaryPerhaps Comic Sans exists in that same area typographically speaking But that said the screens that Comic Sanswas originally designed to appear on were typically aliased and as Kadavypoints out compared to fonts like Garamond Comic Sans does really well here That is how we should think about Comic Sans A pragmatic font a font that workedremarkably well in its era and exists today as one of the mostrecognizable relics of one of the most importantdesign revolutions in historyBooks used to be painstakingly copied by handNow later you could design a story or an idea but the final look really just came down to what a few typesetters could doToday almost anyone can dabble in typography and that is an amazing thingSure it means that Comic Sans will be used A lotBut as Corey Holms points out Comic Dans is proof the design worksThe public understands that type means more than words And David Kadavy argues that just asinterchangeable type led to a spread of literacy Comic Sans and the personal publishing it comes along with should lead us toward a spread of design literacy SureComic Sans is a bit uglyBut its ugly in the same way that the first few chords of Smoke on the Water are ugly as played by almost every beginning guitarist who picks up a guitar at almost every instrument storeSure it sounds annoying and a little bit fumbly but itrepresents someone who is using tools to move toward mastery Adrian Frutiger said that typehas the power to make the whole world of thought legible simply by rearranging the same letters over and over againWell Comic Sans overused by the untrained majority may seem unsavory to some peoplebut as such it most loudly represents something phenomenal Today it is possible for the whole world of thought to be made legible and be shared by the whole world And as always

Will We Ever Visit Other Stars?,2013-02-01T16:54:32Z,12.833333333333334,15545712,259532,Hey Vsauce Michael here Ive been watchingBravest Warriors on Cartoon Hangover lately Its great it was created by Pendleton Wardand in the show teenagers zip around the universe visiting star systems and planets and hereis my question When will we do the same Us humans in real life I mean weve managed to put people on theMoon and land robots on asteroids and Mars and even Titan a moon of Saturn Interplanetary travel is scary coolBut will we ever travel interstellarly Certainly it will happen right I mean Voyager 1 isexpected to reach interstellar space sometime this year or maybe in the next year or twoAnd it was launched way back in 1977 So shows like Bravest Warriors are pretty muchjust a glimpse of our future maybe even one within our lifetimes Right Well were going to need a DONG for this one Something you can Do Online Now Guys The Hayden Planetariums digital universeallows you to explore a 3dimensional map of our Milky Way Now there are about 81visible stars within just 20 lightyears of our own Sun The nearest is Proximus Centauriwhich is only 43 lightyears away Getting there Piece of cake Piece of difficultcake because a lightyear is an incredibly long distance Its the distance that lightin a vacuum will travel in an entire year And in just one second light can travelso far as to circle the entire Equator of Earth7 times Now a fast bullet can travel at about 1500 msAnd Voyager 1 is traveling at about 17000 ms relative to the Sun Also relative tothe Sun our Earth is orbiting at a speed of 29800 ms  thats pretty fastBut the fastest manmade object ever was the Helios 2 Solar Probewhich traveled at a maximum speed of 70220 ms Impressive right Well even at that speedthe fastest speed ever reached by any man made object crossing this little ol gapand reaching Proximus Centauri would take 19000 years But technology in the future is bound to beimproved along with the maximum speeds we are able to obtain Even using what we knownow a solar sail could easily provide the acceleration needed to reach nearlightspeed speedsAnd our current understanding of physics theoretically allows for things like wormholes which intheory could move a spacecraft from one point in space to another faster than light normally could And who could forget the famous Alcubierre driveAn idea that fits within most models of our universe and proposes a way to delivera space craft to a distant object faster than light can get there  not by moving the spacecraftbut instead by collapsing and expanding space itself Things like wormholes and Alcubierre drivesare theoretical but if they could one day become a reality how far away might that day beIt matters And figuring out exactly when in time we should begin an interstellarjourney is called a Wait Calculation Leave too soon and before a ship launched todayfull of frozen embryos ever got to its destination it would be passed by astronauts who lefthundreds or thousands of years later at a point in time when technology was advancedenough to lap what we have today Andrew Kennedy calculated that given thepace of our progress as far as travel velocity is concernedand Earths mean annual economic growth the soonest human civilization might everreach Bernard Star 6 lightyears away is 1104 years from today which isnt withinany of our lifetimes It might also be a bit optimistic because it assumes that we notonly solve the problem of speed but that we also solve problems like how to surviveinterstellar radiation for years or how to avoid collisions with interstellarmaterial at high speeds It also assumes that before we achieve thetechnology needed to successfully interstellarly travel all of human kind isnt wiped outby some cataclysmic natural disaster It may sound unlikely but were not talking aboutthe nearfuture were talking about thousands of years from now Lets put it this wayEven given our current slow means of space travel its estimated that within 5 to 50 millionyears we could theoretically explore and colonize our whole galaxy Thats a lot of time though In fact statisticallyspeaking within the next 500000 years its very likely that Earth will encounter a meteoritenearly a kilometer across Hopefully when that happens we have the prevention abilitiesneeded to keep ourselves safe But given all of this information its easy to see whythe 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference concluded that it was improbable that humans would everexplore beyond the solar system Its quite depressing to think that sceneslike this one from Shutterstock may be destined to only ever remain that  science fiction Wait how quickly is the camera moving in that clip Were used to seeing science fictionscenes like this but a Nebula tends to be lightyears across which means that in thisclip were traveling at least the speed of light if not fasterWould it really look like that I covered this briefly in my black hole videobut not completely If you were to travel at the speed of light or near the speed oflight the universe ahead of you wouldnt look like it usually did First of all yourfield of view would increase It would appear as if the universe was receding away fromyou as you accelerated At the same time all of the light reaching you would be blueshifteduntil you were left with this You may have seen this on Vsauce 2 Its the cosmic backgroundradiation blueshifted alltheway up into the visible range MIT Game Lab offers a free downloadable gamethat puts you in an environment where the speed of light can be lowered allthewaydown to typical walking speed You can experience all of the visual effects I just discussedbut I wanted to know what it would look like if the speed of light was where it is andI took a journey from Earth to the Moon So I enlisted my friend Liam from World ofthe Orange and New Music to put together a simulation of what it might actually looklike to accelerate to nearly the speed of light and then slow downduring a trip from Earth to the Moon Enjoy Whether or not you should believe that allthe right factors will come together and humans will one day travel that quickly or reachinterstellar destinations largely comes down to whether you want to be an optimist or apessimist But what weve accomplished so far is quite amazing considering how weakflimsy and vulnerable the human body is in the vacuum of space Bad Astronomer and SciShow have great videosdiscussing this topic And now thanks to the brilliant team at Bravest Warriors Imgoing to go to space But not while wearing a Vsauce suit no no no Ill do it nakedWhoa Ok not that naked And also maybe some musclesYep so thats pretty much what Id look like The moment Im exposed to the vacuum of spacemy body would not inflate and explode Now the body is a very nicely contained systemBut those parts of me that arent well containedtheyll be the first to go The air in my lungs anddigestive tract would quickly rush out Moist soft tissues would rapidly lose waterMy mouth and lips and eyes would dry out and swell As water was pulled to the surfaceof these things it would vaporize and the decrease in its pressure would cool my mouthand eyes to nearfreezing My body would inflate to about twice its normal size as gasses inmy blood came out of solution slowly evaporating away cooling the surface of my skinOh and the blood vessels in my eyes would likely burst spilling blood into my eyes whichalong with all the other fluid in my eyes would be rapidly vaporizing on the surfacefreezing and drying them out Within about 15 seconds I would go unconsciousbecause oxygen wasnt reaching my brain And as far as Im concerned that would be theend of the entire ordeal For another 90 seconds or so I would still technically be alivebut I wouldnt be aware of it or remember any of it My dead body would remain internallyquite warm for a while because in the near vacuum of space there isnt much matter toconduct of convect heat away from me Instead I would really only lose heat through radiationa much less efficient method It would take hours for me to cool down to the temperatureof space and by then I would be nothing but a driedup piece of slightly bloated andstretched dessicated human jerky If I was exposed to the Suns fullon radiationnot filtered by the usual atmosphere of Earth I would be a grossly sunburnt piece of jerky In case that makes you hungry let me giveyou some nutritional facts 200 pounds of human meat in outer space would eventuallybecome about 120 pounds of freezedried jerky And given what would be left of me that wouldbe edible as a snack Id be worth about 115000 calories Maybe humans are the only intelligent lifein the universe But if you believe that intelligent life could have arisen on other planetsan interesting idea occurs The Fermi Paradox Enrico Fermi calculated that given the numberof planets believed to exist in our galaxy at least some of them must have been habitableto life as we know it And in many cases millions and millions of years before lifeon Earth even existed So if interstellar travel traveling betweenstars and different solar systems really is possible for intelligent life to do whyhave we not been visited by aliens yet Well maybe we have been visited Maybe theyrehere right now and we just cant perceive them Or maybe we havent been discoveredOr maybe we are alone Or maybe were just not worth visiting So what are you waiting for Live your lifein a way that makes traveling lightyears just to hang out with you worth it And as

What's The Most Dangerous Place on Earth?,2013-01-20T17:02:33Z,9.466666666666667,23105768,359364,Hey Vsauce Michael here 93 of all thehumans who have ever lived are dead For every person alive right now there are 15 peoplewho are no longer alive The Earth is dangerousbut where is the most dangerous place on EarthIgnoring freak occurrances where is the most persistently perilous place on the surface of our planet Well lets being with temperature Extremeheat and extreme cold can kill within hours if not minutes In cold environments withoutclothing the human body by itself doesnt do a very good job of maintaining a high enoughtemperature to live It just takes too much work Even when you feel comfortable and warmnearly half of your daily caloric intake is used merely to keep your bodys temperaturewhere it should be If you took a human and stripped them nakedand put them in an environment at 0 degrees Celsius they would die from having too coldof an internal temperature within about 20 minutes We need warmth But one thing weneed more immediately than that is oxygen And that brings us to the summit of Mount EverestThis place on the surface of Earth has incredibly thin air At the top of Mount Everestthere is only one third as much breathable oxygen as there is down at sea level Climbers can endure the conditions for shortperiods of time if they acclimate for months but if you were to teleport from whereveryou are right now directly to the summit of Everest you would most likely die withinonly 23 minutes because there isnt enough oxygen Death would come even more quickly if youwere at the bottom of the Mariana Trench There you would be submerged under nearly7 miles of water about 11 km causing the pressure around your body to exceed 15000pounds per square inch At normal swimming depths you can alwayshold your breath but that far down with that much pressure your lungs would collapseimmediately and without oxygen your brain would go unconscious in 15 secondsand youd be dead in under 90 You would die pretty much just as quicklyas someone who walked into outer space without a suit on But falling into a molten lake of lava isprobably the most spectacular way to go Contrary to what you see in many movies your bodywouldnt just burn a little bit and slowly sink as if it were in quicksand Instead there would be a lot of fireworks Hot molten lava is liquid rock 4 times as hot as youroven can ever get And the human body is mainly made up of water which when exposedto that kind of heat turns into steamexplosively Theres a fantastic video right here on YouTubewhere a guy throws a bag of organic material containing a lot of moisture into hot lavaIt doesnt just sink in it causes a miniature eruption I highly suggest you go watch it But what if we want to measure danger notby how quickly you would die but by the actual total number of fatalities caused Well forthis were going to need to get much much smaller Like microscopic In 1918 influenza killed nearly 100 millionpeople which at the time was 3 of the worlds entire population But places whereand when the plague has spread rapidly are even scarier Between 1347 and 1353 a thirdof everybody in Europe died because of the bubonic plaguean infection caused by Yersinia Pestis Its easy to think of the plague as somethingfrom way back in the past but it is still here Of course now we have antibiotics whichcan help in most cases but believe it or not in America alone 5 to 15 peoplestill get the plague every year In terms of total fatalities however theplague and influenza are nothing compared to the danger caused by this guy plasmodium Its a microorganism that can get into ourblood because of mosquito bites and causes Malaria Across the totality of human historythe number of deaths attributed to Malaria is unbelievable Researchers like Nobel laureateBaruch Blumberg have studied the history of the human genome and human migration anddetermined that of all the humans who have ever existed it is likely that half died from malaria So in terms of total fatalities across allof human history a place where plasmodium could enter the blood stream because of amosquito bite statistically speaking could be called the most dangerous place on Earth But lets switch gears for a moment and talkabout places that are dangerous not because of Earth or Earths creatures well actuallyjust one specific creature us La Oroya is a mining town in Peru where themurder rate is low but pollution is high The towns smelter emits pollution into the airand temperature inversions in the atmosphere above the town trap gasses withincausing the town to have 85 times more arsenic in its air than is deemed safe But thats nothing compared to Lake Karachayin Russia It was named the most polluted spot on Earth by the World Watch Instituteon Nuclear Waste The lake contains so many radioactive pollutantsthat you can receive a lethal dose of radiation merely by standing for one hour near certainparts of the lake The Global Peace Index ranks countries byhow safe they are It takes into account a number of factors including crime and politicalcorruption The safest country according to the Index is IcelandAnd the least safe is Somalia But for the highest murder rate youll haveto go to Juarez Mexico where out of every 1 million inhabitants each year 1477of them are murdered Ive always found it amazing just how manyserial killers Miami seems to have on the show Dexter But Miami is a big city andso despite all those serial killers its murder rate in the show is not the highestof any fictional town from a TV show That honor goes to Cabot Cove the town where MurderShe Wrote occurred An analysis of Murder She Wrote episodes revealed 274 murdersbut a population in the town of only 3500 making Cabot Coves murder rate1490 per million inhabitants Until recently that number was unmatched byreality but last year the city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras reported a murder rate of1588 murders per million inhabitants Lets conclude by revisiting pollution specificallythe Chernobyl accident and a certain oxymoronic danger For 10 days in 1986 radioactive isotopesspilled out of a blazing reactor core forcing mass evacuations Its more than 25 yearslater now and many parts of the exclusion zone remain incredibly lethal But withouthumans there many parts of the exclusion zone have seen wildlife flourish especiallyendangered species which can go to the exclusion zone live reproduce and be safefrom usWe managed to ruin a place to the point at which it endangered our lives and we hadto leave and in doing so we left parts of it a little bit safer for other forms of life You can read more about all of these topicsby following links down in the description below Keep

The Science of the Friend Zone,2013-01-10T20:03:09Z,9.216666666666667,12064713,310282,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd today were going to talk about the science of the friend zoneYou know the experience of liking someone and then finding outthat they would rather just be friends with youWhy does it happen If theres hope of escaping the friend zone how can it be done And more importantly should you The term friend zone was popularized by the TV show Friends on November 3 1994 In Episode 7 of the first season Joey tells Ross that Rachel likes him but will never like like him Ross is in the friend zoneNow of course everything turned out fine for Rossbut were getting ahead of ourselves Back when I calculated how much money love is worth I discussed the feeling of having a crush on someone Those emotions the nervousnessthe excitement have a name What you feel when you have a crush onsomebody is known as limerence Its exciting to feelbutterflies in your stomach whenever youre around somebody and those butterflies may be caused by the release of adrenaline which pulls blood awayfrom things like your stomach and toward the muscleswhere it may be better used Of course this can cause the stomach to shut downa bit become upset It may also explain why people have a reduced appetite when they feel love sickNow whether you are male female gay straight everybody can be friendzonedAnd biologically speaking the route of the friend zone may be Batemans PrincipleNamed after Angus Bateman the principle states thatwhenever a species like us humans contains two different sexes each with dissimilar sex cells for instance sperm and egg inevitably one sex willhave to commit more resources to the production of offspringIn mammals this is especially true A female can have only a limited number of offspring whereas a male can have a virtually unlimited numberThis causes a biological tendency for one sex to be competitive and for the other to be choosyThe newest episode of Earth Touchs Wild Sex goes into a lotmore detail about this so be sure to check it outBut today regardless of whether or notreproduction is the goal the roles of pursuer and pursued have extended beyond the Batemanprinciple and are now quite hardwired into our cultureBecause not every pursuer can win and because not every pursuer is a terrible jerk some friendzoning in is inevitable Its disappointing when it happens toyou and its easy to rely on the nice guys finish last excuse but so far research hasnt found much evidence for itWhats more likely is that you have idealized the other person as a potential mate but a neutral observer could tell you that in reality the two of you dont have as muchin common as you think This is the argument put forward by Jenna Marbles in her fantastic videoIts called homogamy We select our mates based on how similarthey are to our own personalities interests and ideals for the futureAnd so when someone is friendzoned its often not because theywere too friendly or too much of a nice guy instead its often just runofthemill incompatibility But lets not rule out being too friendly or too nice from every situation just yet Marshall Fine described the friend zoneas a penalty box that youre sent to when your only crime is not being buff or unobtainable enough Buffness falls into homogamy Its aboutwhat someone elses interests are and what they want from a mate But what fascinates me is the part about being unobtainableWhy would being available and present and friendly make you less attractive And why would being kind of a jerk too cool aloof or hard to get make you more attractiveWell Robert Cialdini calls this the scarcity principleWe desire things that are difficult to obtain because we dont like to have our freedom limited and we act before it can beThis happens all the time in business and its equally true when it comes to attraction Using the scarcity effect yourself is often cited as a possible escape routefrom the friend zone Make yourself less available and see if your crush responds or try using the Ben Franklin effectBenjamin Franklin wrote about how he was able to form relationships with other people by asking them to do things for him The theory is that by doing favors foryou cognitive dissonance occurs in the persons mind Why would they be doing favors for you unless they liked you Now its no guaranteethat youll become more than friends but just by simply becoming friends youll be doing something quite special because today we all on average have fewer friends fewer close individuals we can confide in than we did decades agoAnd we hang out with those friends less than we did before This phenomenon wasexplored famously by Robert Putnam in Bowling AloneFor instance from 1965 to 1995 the number of minutes people of all agesreported spending per day with informal socializing hanging out with friends going to parties hanging out at bars orhaving informal conversations fell from 85 minutes to just 57In about the same time frame the number of picnics held fell 60 percent And the number of times on average weentertain friends at home fell from 14 to 15 times a year to a mere 8 We spend more time than we used to on entertainment sleep exercise and transportation Not bad things but since the middle of the 20th century the two activities that many of us stilldo that have decreased the most are attending worship service and hanging out with friendsWere also now spending time on this new thing called the Internet Its a great tool forcommunication and social networks but like T S Eliot said of the telephone before it the Internet may simply allow usto speak to more people than ever before but be more lonely doing itSocial networks have somewhat diluted the power of the word friendBut way before MySpace or Facebook the word friend was on the way outSo much so that we had to start using a new word best friendRobert Wuthnow cautions that on the Internet what feels social may be less of a way for us to focus on actual interpersonal relationships and instead more of a stage for us to focus on ourselves in the presence of other peopleTo be sure virtual communities are often more equal because we know less information aboutour discussion partners like age race or genderBut what we gain from anonymity often comes at the cost of an evening out of interests and values I can retreat from realworld conversations and hide within niche communities onlinewhere everyone thinks like me and generally shares my worldview Its called cyberbalkanization Its when online interactions provide a lazy environment free from actual discussionand outside views Whereas the real world often forces usto deal with the greater diversity of interests and valuesNow because we choose mates that are so similar to ourselves this vital exposure to new honest ideas often has to come from friends  a resource that is diminishing in our societyAnd so although its disappointing to be friendzoned in a way it might be where that other person and all of us actually need you the most And as always thanks for

This Is Only Red,2013-01-02T18:20:24Z,8.066666666666666,4934322,96153,Happy New Year Vsauce Michael hereAnd in honor of 2013 lets discuss 13 things To begin where to spend all that cashyou picked up over the holidays Now plenty of website sell cool stuffUnited Nuclear sells Aerogel radioactive isotopes jet engine schematic and even marbles doped with uraniumMaths Gear sells these cool non transitive dice I actually bought yesterday as does Grand IllusionsBut they also carry for explosive magic tricks optical illusion masks and a poster of this imageWhat makes that image so specialWell its an example of the land effectEven though it appears to contain a bunch of different colors oranges and yellows and greens the entire image is actually made out of nothing but red Seriously Ive linked the imagedown in the descriptions so you can grab it and investigated using your favorite image editorThe yellows are actually light reds or pinksAnd the green is just dull grey redWhats going on is called color constancyYour visual system your eyes and brain calculate the average illuminationconditions of a scene and then subtract those conditionsso that colors remain relatively constant This is why a blue object looks bluewhether youre viewing it under the midday Sun or a dark redsunset or fluorescent light or incandescent light Its a very brilliant system but it can fool us Special images like this one appearto be illuminated with a lot of red light so your brain actually subtracts the redand makes assumptions There are plenty of other examples ofthe land effect and other ways our visual system lies to us But you know what else is a lie RaindropsWell at least that depiction of raindropsRaindrops are not shaped like teardropsSurface tension means that  small drops are spherical but when they combine the air and getbigger the pressure of the air below them as they fall causes the bottom to flatten which means that raindrops areshaped less like teardrops and more like hamburger buns But how many raindrops have fallen on land everIts a fun question and there are plenty of resourcesdiscussing how many raindrops fall during a typical storm but throughout all of historyLets go to mathforumorg for this one Doctor Ian calculated quite roughly but amusingly that giventhe percentage of earth usually covered in land and the amount of rain that typically falls on earth and the volume of a raindrop the total number of raindrops that have fallen on land ever since earth began is about 16 times 10 to the 28So earth has had a lot of raindrops But you know what earth doesnt have alot of Nice big old chunks of Moon rock Material from the Moon is incredibly rare We can only get pieces of the Moon in two waysBy visiting it or by finding chunks of theMoon that were blown off a long time ago and eventually fell to Earth Interestingly you can buy paintings containing traces of Moon dust made by an astronautI discussed this with my friends over at emotistyle video link in the descriptionBut the point is you will not be owning a big old Moon rock anytime soonInterestingly a surprising number of the rocks webrought back from the Moon have been stolen or just plain lostFor instance in 2002 interns Thad Roberts and Tiffany Fowler stole 101 grams of lunar material from the Johnson Space CenterThey celebrated by throwing the rocks onto a bed and I guess the best way to explain whathappened next would just be to point out that the book based on this true story is called Sex on the MoonOr from a different angle funThis was built using the Side View maker Type in a word or name and it willconstruct the word using dots which from another angle saysomething else For instance Vsauce can be vacuumIf you prefer dots that represent people Brandon MartinAndersons got just whatyou need The entire 2010 US Census on a map with a dot for every single personThe data is specific down to the size of an individual blockIts really fun to play around with as is the searchable Calvin and HobbesI shared this on tweetsauce a few weeks ago Type in a word and you can find everysingle Calvin and Hobbes comic strip that used that word Words or phrasesthat help you remember something are called mnemonicsFor instance if you wanna remember the exact speed of light in meters per second in avacuum just count the number of letters and each word of this sentenceWe guarantee certainty clearly referring tothis light mnemonic Or if youre like me your biggeststruggle is spelling the word diarrhoeaWell dont worry Just remember diarrhoea is a really runny heap of endless amountsWeve all seen illusions like this before Four circles with corners cut out of themWe perceive an actual square resting on top ofcircles even though no square is thereNow interestingly if you take this shape and put it on top of text the letters within the fake square appear bigger than the rest of the letters This is because our brain assumes the letters are closer to us than the rest of the text After allthe letters are on top of a square thats on top of circles on top of text Speaking of size lets take a look at the scale of our solar systemOMGspacenet is a website containing images of theSun and the planets to scaleNot just in size but also distance If you scroll long enoughyou will eventually get to Mercury and then Venus and then Earth and so onOr just click a planets name and have the site take you there right awayIf that sort of thing makes you feel small and insignificant rush on over and grab yourself emergency compliment dot com The site will keep complimenting youuntil you feel better but if practicing patience is more your thing check out chickenonaraftcomGeo sketch is a really fun way to draw You have this strange folding mechanism that drawsYou can individually control the rate of rotation for each joint to see how it affects the imageBut if youd rather combine rotation with our solar system check out gravityClick and drag to place objects of varying size in the space and watch how they interactSo there you go that was about 13 things I guess I dont really knowBut theres more I created a playlist of videos that you should totally see I host the playlist and you can start it byclicking the link at the top of this videos description or this annotationI call it a lean back because you start the playlist andjust lean back and let YouTube do the workSo what are you waiting for Go ahead and click and I will see you over there And as always thanks for

How Many Calories are on a Smudgy Screen?,2012-12-24T17:52:16Z,6.366666666666666,4905154,82793,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd Im home for the holidays Im in my parents basementusing a different camera than usual But you know what is always differentFingerprints The palms of our hands and the soles of ourfeet are weird They are covered with friction ridges whichact like the design of a stamp that stamps everything you touchPlastic or patent prints are visible to the naked eyeBut even with seemingly clean hands on a seemingly clean surface a fingerprint can be leftA latent fingerprint But what are those made ofWell by the square millimetre theyre made out of thisAll of this stuff is natural In fact a lot of it is produced to keep yourskin healthy waterproof pliable But touch a surface enough and the gunk can build up Its what causes smudges on computer screensand mobile devices Now given that protein contains 4 caloriesper gram fat contains 9 calories per gram and the surface area of the iPhone 5 is 4400square millimetres completely licking clean a smudgy iPhone 5 screen is gonna give youabout 2 calories If you were to lick clean 245 smudgy iPhones 5 well that would be the same as eating a Big MacBut before you run off and get all of your nutrition from smudgy phones you should know thatus humans need a bit more variety than that Ive always found it interesting that catsand dogs can grow up and live great lives eating the exact same food everydayWell what about us humans What can we eat everyday without ever changingit up and be fine It turns out that there is one type of foodthat you could eat everyday for the rest of your life and be finewithout ever having something different If you follow tweetsauceyou already know what it is The answer is human breast milkWhether your ridges loop or arch or whorl is largely geneticBut the tiny minutiae of your prints formed while you were developing inside your motherIt tells a story about the very specific conditions around the dividing cells that became your skin And for that reason even identical twinswho pretty much share the exact same DNA wind up with different fingerprintsI could clone you 100 times and every one of those clones would have a unique set of fingerprints Your skin has two major layersThe epidermis on the outside and the dermis which is belowThe basal layer of your epidermis creates new skin cells which migrate up towards theoutside world where they die and flatten out forming the protective outermost partof your skin  the horny layer  which means that all day everyday you are covered withand showing off to the entire world your horny layerThese outer cells are constantly shed away but their arrangement stays the same becausetheir shape is determined by the shape of the basal layer down belowThis is why you can superficially and temporarily sandpaper or cut off your fingerprints buttheyll still grow back the way they were beforeBut why do we have fingerprints in the first placeI mean not all mammals have friction ridges Is this some sort of cruel joke the universemade to make it more difficult for us humans to get away with crimesProbably not The most likely answer is twofoldFirst of all it has been show that friction ridges allow us to sense subtle textures 100times better than if we didnt have them And because fingerprints loop and arch andswirl in different directions all it takes is one simple touch for us to detect a subtletexture moving in any direction Its also been shown that having frictionridges allows mammals like us primates koalas the North American fisher to betterclimb and grasp wet stuff Even though no two fingerprints are exactlythe same the methods we have for matching fingerprints arent always perfectThere are plenty of different ways to model fingerprints and each one is calculated atdifferent probability of a false match But if you wanna commit a crime its bestto just avoid fingerprints altogether How about hiring someone with adermatoglyphiaA few skin conditions can cause the disappearance of fingerprintsBut adermatoglyphia is a genetic one that has no other side effectsBut its rare Only four extended families on Earth are knownto have the condition But if you wanna avoid leaving fingerprintsand cant find somebody with adermatoglyphia dont worry just find someone who hasntgone through puberty yet Sure kids might snot and slob all over stuffbut they carry far less heavy waxy oil on their skinAnd for this reason the fingerprints of a child will disappear evaporate much morequickly than those of an adult A childs fingerprints can evaporate in only a few hours So use kids to commit your crimes And as always thanks for watching,122.67015706806284,differentFingerprints,0.0,1.0,MVpkeBYZOrE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVpkeBYZOrE
Why Don't We Taxidermy Humans?,2012-12-12T18:17:20Z,11.15,11658113,277929,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd when you die what happens to your bodyIt can be buried or cremated or donated to science but are those your only optionsI mean what if I wanted to be taxidermied like my friend here What if I requested to have my bodystuffed and mounted in some hilarious position like a permanent high five so people could high five my actual skin forever Well it turns out to be quite complicated So lets begin with an easier and more flexible solution Cremation and ashesTwelve humans have walked on the MoonBut 300 humans have been buried in outer space With the right connections and budgetyou can have a portion of your ashes launched into spaceThe very first space burial occurred in 1997 when a rocket deposited the ashes of 24 people into orbit around Earth In 1999 human remains were first buried on the MoonA lunar prospector probe dropped some scientific instruments and some of the crematedremains of Eugene Shoemaker codiscoverer of the comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 But the first human to have their remains leave our solar system will be Clyde Tombaugh the guy who discovered Pluto In 2006 some of his ashes were launchedaboard the New Horizons probe which will arrive near Pluto in 2015 take some recordings and pictures andthen continue on beyond our solar systemYou dont need to get all outer spacey to have fun with you ashesRight here on earth there are companies that will take carbonfrom your remains and expose them to extreme heat and pressure long enough that you wind up with a diamond made out of you It can be cut andpolished One woman even had it done with the ashes of Meowy her cat The point here is that you can be quite creative with cremated remainsBut ashes dont look like you did when you were alive so lets revisit taxidermy The shapes and combinationsthat animals have been taxidermied into are quite creativeFor instance an actual pig turned into an actual piggy bank A bird light fixtureA goat thats also a bagpipe Doves turned into shoesAnd of course the guy who taxidermied his cat into a remotecontrolled quadcopter Taxidermy doesnt preserve every part of your bodyIt is taxi dermy  the arrangement of skin which is okayI mean taxidermy wont bother to preserve all of your internal organs but your skin is your largest organYour skin comprises anywhere from 12 to 15 percent of your total body weight plus its anorgan that people see and recognize you byBut heres one of the problems When animals are taxidermiedtheir skin is removed and then mounted on a mannequinA shape that resembles the animal but is made of wood or wall and wire or foam Thats fine for museumsBut the use of a generic mannequin can lead to an animal that looks generic All of the tiny subtle but very importantfeatures of the animals cartilage fat muscles are more difficult to recreate after its dead and all you have is its skin Thats why many taxidermists hesitate to taxidermy a persons beloved pet Because in order to satisfy the clientan immense amount of specificity is required Even more so if you were trying to recreate a person So taxidermy may not be the best way topreserve yourself or your daddy or your mummyMummies What about themWell lets go back to the 19th century and Jeremy Bentham When he died thephilosopher requested that his body be mummified as best as technology would allowand his body dressed up in clothes and displayed at the University Collegeof London It periodically still is but the mummification didnt turnout perfectl so hes really just a skeleton dressed up in clothes and stuffed The head wound up looking a bit toowrinkled and the color was off and so a wax head was madeYou can check out a 3D photograph of Jeremy Bentham onlineAnd who could forget the dried out mummified middle finger of Galileo We still have it and its on display in Florence Its a great thing to visit if you wanta pivotal historical figure to flip you offBut were looking for a way to preserve ourselves realistically as we appear while living So lets take a look at embalmingNot all corpses are embalmed before theyreburied but embalming is a great technique for preserving a body slowing down decompositionso it can stay above ground and be displayed a little bit longerNow if a body is embalmed really really wellit can be preserved longer than you might thinkAbraham Lincoln was embalmed so well that even though his coffin has been moved 17 times since he was buried and the casket opened five times on each of those occasionsincluding the most recent in 1901 people said yeah still looks like Lincoln On an even more extreme scale are thebodies of people like Mao and Lenin which continue to be on display to this day The bodies require specialtreatments multiple times a week The exact techniques and embalming fluidsused to preserve Lenin are kept secret but theyve kept him preserved for more than 80 yearsWell embalmed bodies can be displayed before being buried in more positions than just lying down in a coffinFor instance leaned up against a wall or riding a motorcycle WowBut embalming doesnt last for everand if you try to make it last forever be prepared to spend a lot of money and time One method that could be used on humansand has become popular with pets is similar to instant coffeeFreezedrying The process involves freezing the animal so that all of its water solidifiesAnd then using a partial vacuum with the pressure so low that the solid water instantly turns into vapor and escapes away leaving a much much lighter freezedried pet Unfortunately when it comes to preserving a human body as realistically as possible after death these methods  freezedrying mummification taxidermy longterm embalming are either unsatisfactory or impractical With the exception possibly of a slightly newer method  plastinationIts the method used to prepare bodies for exhibits like Body WorldsEssentially plastination involves a specimen soaked in a volatile solvent and then placed in a polymer solutionIn a lowpressure environment the volatile solvent leaves the specimen and the empty space is filled with the polymer solution The specimen is flexible and can be put into a pose and then the polymer hardened by using special gases Human bodies that have been plastinatedlast a very long time even at room temperatureBut heres the crazy thing Its freeYou can quite easily donate your body to the Institute for PlastinationIt counts as donating your body to science But heres the thing you wont necessarily have control over whats done with your body because at the end of the day corpses are legally not propertyNo one owns a corpseBecause a corpse is not legally a piece of propertyno one can just do whatever they want with itYour options are severely limited and even if you you specifically have requested say that your body be taxidermied andall of your surviving can agree and want it to happen its very unlikely that a mortuary wouldallow that to happen and historically the law sides with the mortuaryFor example in 1994 David Eugene Russellrequested that when he died his body be skinnedhis skin tanned in the leather and that leather used to bind a book of his writings He wanted this to happen as did his surviving widow But the mortuary refused to do it andthe court sided with the mortuary So even if you have a really cool idea forhow your body could be embalmed forever and displayed in a funny weird or bizarre way youre not going to get permission to do so Plastination winds up being one ofyour only options but you wont have a lot of control over what happens to you once plastinated But hold on a secondIn 1998 AnthonyNoel Kelly was arrested forstealing anatomical specimens from the Royal College of SurgeonsNow he claimed that he was not guilty of theft because a corpse is not a piece of propertyHe was merely guilty of the mistreatment of a corpseBut the judge ruled that because these anatomical specimenshad been especially prepared by licensed and skilled workers at the college they had become propertySo heres something really strange If you found a way to get your body taxidermied for the benefit of medical science in doing so you may actually become a piece of ownable propertySo in a way bean taxidermied may be the best way to allow your survivors your loved ones to legally and literally have you forever And as always thanks for watching,128.78923766816143,occasionsincluding,0.0,1.0,L6S5amkCoyc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6S5amkCoyc
Is The 5-Second Rule True?,2012-11-30T18:54:13Z,10.533333333333333,15950911,300528,Hey Vsauce Michael here And bananas are fantastic Theyre actually one of the most radioactive foods we regularly eat Sometimestheyre difficult to peel from the top One of my favorite ways to avoid that is to simplyhold the banana and snap it in half Boom now it peels itself Its a wonderful littletrick except when you drop it on the ground This is unfortunate but if it picked itup quickly would it be safe enough to eat I mean how quickly do the bacteria on thefloor move onto the food Some people call it the 5Second Rule Others the 10SecondRule And still others the 2Second Rule But is there any truth to it or is it justsomething we say to allow us to eat food off the floor In 2003 Jillian Clarke famously investigatedthis question She found that 50 of men use the 5Second Rule to eat food off the groundBut 70 of women do More importantly she found that even brief contact with a contaminatedfloor will contaminate food wet or dry The Myth Busters found similar resultsAnd a paper published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology got even more technicalThe researchers contaminated various floor surfaces with salmonella and they found that 5 secondsis way too long to wait Bacteria adhere to dropped food almost immediately but timedoes matter After 5 seconds they found that the food had acquired anywhere from 150 to 8000 bacteria But if left for a full minute the number they found was 10 times greater Now considering it only takes about 10 bacteriaof certain strains of salmonella to infect you you should probably think twice before eating off the ground Oh and dont complacently think that youresafe because the floor looks clean or the food that fell on it does Floors make greathomes for bacteria Also floors come in contact with the bottoms of our shoesand the University of Arizona has found that 93 of our shoes are contaminated with fecal bacteria Ive linked all of these studies down in thedescription Theyre great reads very thorough But is it true that food dropped on a dirtyfloor becomes contaminated immediately I mean sure practically speaking that makesa lot of sense But instantly Is there a limit to how quickly bacteria can move fromone object to another Is there an amount of time short enough that were I to pickthe food up within it there would be no way for what it touched to contaminate it Well were going to need to define touchIve talked about this before on Vsauce and on Thinker and MinutePhysics has a greatquantum perspective but when we say touch we tend to think of two objects contactingeach other with no space in between Unfortunately thats not really what happens At a subatomiclevel atoms resist smashing together because their electrons repel Electrons can be modeledas waves waves that overlap and interact but they never touch Theres always spacebetween them When I touch something or someone Im really just feeling their electrons reactto mine at a distance A subatomically small one but a real one So if thats the case how come glue canstick things together How come lipstick sticks to lips And how can bacteria on a dirty floorstick to food thats been dropped on it The positive charge from the protons in anatom or molecule isnt always balanced perfectly in space by the negative charge from electronsSometimes a molecule is asymmetrical and this imbalance is permanent which gives the moleculea constant dipole so its like a tiny little magnet But even in symmetrical molecules electronsare mobile At any one point in time they might happen to find themselves more towardsone end of the molecule than the other creating rapidly fluctuating dipolescausing the molecule to act like a magnet If molecules have a lot of energy they willsimply whiz by one another and their dipoles and those of their neighbors wont matter muchBut if you cool them down slow them down the dipoles will have more of an effectwhich is why molecules tend to stick together as they cool  going from a gas to a liquid to a solid Thats a lot of information about moleculesbut its incredibly important Its the reason things can get wet In fact when you getout of the shower you on average weigh about one more pound more than you did beforeyou got wet Its also the reason Capillary Action happens If you dip a napkin in a glassof water you can watch the water climb up the napkin against gravity Thats because the moleculesof water have very strong dipoles and theyre attracted to each other  cohesion  and theyreattracted to molecules of the paper  adhesion  more strongly than gravity pulls them down If you want to learn more about intermolecularforces Ive put a bunch of links down in the description But heres my question howquickly do those forces act Can two surfaces come into contact briefly enough that theirmolecules dont have time to be influenced by intermolecular forces Well for this were going to need Molecular Dynamics Molecular Dynamics is the computer simulationof the physical movements of atoms or molecules For instance this is a simulation of a singlecopper atom depositing on a copper surface Notice that the timer up there is countingoff hundredths of a picosecond These simulations need to have a narrow enough timestep toaccount for the fastest molecular vibrations of the materialincluding everything from wagging to scissoring Typically time as brief as a quadrillionthof a second is taken into account So the 5second rule may be true If we rename itthe 1 Femtosecond Rule Spend less time on the floor than that and its unlikelythat room temperature molecules would have time to be influenced by intermolecular forcesExcept oops I think weve been thinking too small Intermolecular forces are funbut objects can become entangled with each other on a macroscopic level Glue and makeup and other sticky stuff oftentake advantage of the tiny imperfections  ridges and nooks and crannies  on an objectssurface Sticky things can seep inside and hold on Even surfaces that seem smooth tous when you really get down to it arent smooth at all Two sheets of paper from a phonebook may slideacross each other quite easily but multiply that friction by the number of pages in twophonebooks by interweaving the pages and youve got yourself a monstercapable of lifting an entire car I was recently lucky enough to see this happenin real life You can check out my adventure over on Fast Furious  Funny Its a newchannel Stay tuned because we lifted cars with more than just phonebooks The adhesion between two objects caused bythe shapes of their surfaces contributes to friction and is known as mechanical adhesionIt plays a pretty big role in getting floor germs to sick to dropped food In fact if two surfaces can mechanicallyadhere but arent close enough to do so we wouldnt say they were touching And soif by definition touching means that you can mechanically adhere to other objects surfacewell then maybe the 5Second Rule shouldnt be known as the 1 Femtosecond Rulebecause if theyre touching its already too late and instead the rule should be known asthe Dont Touch Food Thats Fallen on the Floor Rule But come to think of it maybe we shouldntbe eating food thats touched anything because bacteria are everywhere including on youright now There are more bacteria on your body right now than there are people living in America There are 40 million bacteria in one gramof soil and 5 nonillion bacteria on Earth Its been found that one out of every 10 bankcards and one out of every 7 bills has fecal bacteria on it Heres something fun Go down to the commentsection and type the letter V If you used a mobile phone to do that congratulationsyou just touched 6281 bacteria If youre using a desktop keyboard youre a littlesafer You probably only touched about 180 Cellphones are actually one of the most bacteriariddenthings we frequently encounter If you want to estimate about how many bacteriaare specifically on your phone based on how clean you are The Oatmeal has a really greatquiz You can find that in the description But honestly what amazes me the most isnthow dirty our world is or how much bacteria there is instead its the fact that despitethose numbers we dont get sick more often Our immune system is amazing but it relieson the same principles of adhesion that bacteria do The forces that cause food dropped on thefloor to pick up germs are the same forces that we need to fight them Theyre same forcesthat bring us closer together whether we like it or not So keep adhering And as always thanks for watching,138.70253164556962,intermolecularforces,0.0,1.0,rYXdsOEWBj0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYXdsOEWBj0
Will We Ever Run Out of New Music?,2012-11-20T21:06:53Z,11.8,15931831,307903,Hey Vsauce Michael here And the iTunes store contains 28 million different songs Lastfm carries 45 million songs and theGracenote database of artists titles and labels contains 130 million different songsThats a lot If you were to listen to all of the songs in the Gracenote database oneafter the other in a giant playlist it would take you more than 1200 years to complete But since there are a finite number of tonesour ears can distinguish and because it only takes a few notes in common for two musicalideas to sound similar will we ever run out of new music Will there ever be a day where every possiblebrief little melody has been written and recorded and we are left with nothing new to make A good rule of thumb might be to say thatif modern recording technology cant distinguish the difference between two songs well neithercould we So lets begin there with digital downloads MP3s CDs and a calculationmade by Covered in Bees Digital music is made out of bitsLots and lots of bits But each individual bit exists in one of two states a 0 or a 1 Now what this means in that for any givensay 5minutelong audio file the number of possibilities mathematically speakingis enormous but mindblowingly finite A compact disk which samples music at 441kHz is going to need about 211 million bits to store one 5minute song And because abit can exist in two states either a 0 or a 1 the number of possible differentways to arrange those 211000000 bits is 2 to the 211th million power That value represents every single possibledifferent 5minutelong audio file But how big is that numberWell lets put this in perspective A single drop of water contains 6 sextillionatoms 6 sextillion is 22 digits long Thats a long number But the total number of atomsthat make up the entire earth is a number that is about 50 digits long And estimationsof the total number of hydrogen atoms in our universe is a number that is 80 digits long But 2 to the 211 millionth power the numberof possible different 5minute audio files is a number that is 63 million digits long It is a numberlarger than we can even pretend to understand It contains every possible CD quality 5minuteaudio file Inside that amount is everything from Beethovens 5th to Becks Loser it even contains a 5 minute conversation you had with your parents when you were 3 years oldIn fact every one of them It even contains every possible conversation you didnt havewith your parents when you were 3 years old But it is finite not infinite Its coolto think about but it doesnt come very close to answering the question of this video whichis how many possible different songs can we create and hear the difference between So for that were going to need to narrowdown our hunt On Everything2 Ferrouslepidoptera made acalculation that involved some assumptions that I think helped narrow the field downin a really nice way She took a look at the total number of possibledifferent melodies you could create within one octave containing any or all of the intervalswe divide octaves into Of course sound frequencies can be divided much more granularly than thatbut giving ourselves more notes might mean we could make more technically different melodiesbut they wouldnt necessarily sound any different to our ears Now given a single measure containing anycombination of whole half quarter eighth sixteenth or thirtysecond notes she calculatedthat there would be this many possible unique measures which is a smaller number than wehad before but to put it in perspective this is how many seconds old the universe is Yerricdes calculation is even more specificHe stayed within one octave but instead of looking at a complete measure he only consideredthe number of unique combinations of 8 notes He also assumed that typical melodies aswe know them today only contain about three different types of note length For instance quarter eighth and sixteenth or whole half and quarter To be sure that will most likely not alwaysbe true Musical tastes hundreds thousands of years from now will most assuredly be differentbut given melodies as we know them today across 8 notes over 12 intervals there areabout 79 billion possible combinations Were getting relatively small here I meanunder this definition of melody 100 songwriters creating a brand new 8note melody every secondwould exhaust every possible melody within only 248 years But its still a huge number way bigger thanthe total number of songs that have been written that we know about So you can quite safelysay that no we will never run out of new music But heres the rub If thats the casewhy are there so many commonalities between songs Even across hundreds of years howcome so many songs kind of sound the same I mean if we have more possibilities thanwe could ever exhaust why is Twinkle Twinkle Little Star the Alphabet Song and BaaBaa Black Sheep all the same melody My Country Tis of Thee and God Save theQueen interestingly enough are the same song Love Me Tender is exactly the same as theold American Civil War song Aura Lea And a seemingly uncountable number of songsmerely sound like other songs The Spongebob Squarepants theme has a very similar cadenceto Blow the Man Down Soundsjustlikecom is a great resource forexploring this further Itll show you two songs and how they sort of sound alike And when it comes to musical chordsits almost as if theres no variety at all as was famously shown by The Axis of Awesomes4 Chords Ive linked it in the description its worth a watch if you havent seen italready These guys sing more than 40 different songs using the same four chords Even though the number of possible differentmelodies is gigantic us humans tend to gravitate towards certain patterns that we like morethan others and we are influenced by what came before us Kirby Ferguson has a fantasticseries looking into this called Everything is a Remix Ive also linked that down inthe description The commonalities he shows are pretty crazy Well even when it comes to lyrics to writingeven though mathematically there are more possibilities than we could ever exhaustwe have gravitated towards a few In fact theres a form of poetic meter that is socommon its called Common Meter Ive composed a verse using it to explain what it is Line one contains eight syllables The nextcontains just six For emphasis iambic stress Thats it no other tricks Here is a list of songs that are written in commonmeter also known as Balad Meter The commonness of common meter is the reason you can singthe Pokemon theme song to the tune of Gilligans Island Or House of the Rising Sun Or AmazingGrace You could also use almost any of Emily Dickinsons poetry Sure theyre differentmelodies but their lyrics are written in the same meter Theres a great video on YouTube that Ivelinked below in the description that uses captions to let you see just how these allfit together Oh and dont forget one of the greatest compositionstaking advantage of common meters commonness Stairway to Gilligans Island And you know what Our brains may also bekeeping us from enjoying the entire mathematical space of available songs For instanceresearch has shown that the way a song compresses using software can help us predict how enjoyableit will be Too simple too easy to compress like say a rising scale and the song doesntchallenge us  its boring But too complicated say white noise and the file wont compressvery much at all and likewise we dont seem to enjoy it Theres a magic zone wherea file is compressible by a computer and also happens to be enjoyable by us So interestingly even though mathematicallyspeaking there are so many possible unique melodies that we can safely say there willalways be room for new music we dont seem to be wired to care We enjoy certain patternsand melodies and calculating how many there could be is a lot less interesting than howconnected and similar all the ones that we enjoy are Its as if we have more space thanwe need more space than we could ever hope to see all of or visit all of or know allof but no matter what new place we go in a general sense new popular music will alwaysremind us a bit of home And as always thanks for watching Fantastic youre still here If you wantto hear music from people like you from

How Many Photos Have Been Taken?,2012-11-10T12:42:36Z,6.45,4791067,77131,Hey Vsauce Michael hereIn 1826 this became the very first photograph ever takenAnd in 1992 this became the very first image ever uploaded to the webBut how many photographs have we all taken altogether throughout all of historyWell 1000memories investigated this very questionThey took a look at the number of digital cameras currently in use typical usage of a digitalcamera as well as the amount of analog film and filmdeveloping supplies used by the industryever since the 19th century Tabulated altogether they estimated thatwe have taken 35 trillion photographs 4 billion of which were taken this year aloneWe are snapping more photographs than ever before because of the proliferation of easytouseaffordable digital cameras In fact we take 4 times more pictures per daythan we did 10 years ago Or think of it this wayToday every 2 minutes humanity takes more pictures than we took altogether in the entire 1800s Of course the 1800s were a long time agoBut if we take every year from the invention of photography until today 10 of all ofthose images a tenth of every still image recorded of our world was taken in the last 12 months Thats a lotBut even crazier is the fact that a fifth of these images 20 of them all wind upin the same place  Facebook Facebook is hugeBut to put it in perspective you Vsaucers are hugeIf all of us got together in one place and claimed independence we would become the152nd largest country on Earth Right between GuineaBissau and Trinidad and Tobago But Facebook with is 1 billion users wouldbe the 3rd largest country on Earth To take a quick dark detour of those 1 billionpeople on Facebook its estimated that 30 million of them are now deadAnd in 100 years its estimated that half a billion of the people on Facebook will be deceased Facebook stories offers a really neat toolwhere you click on a country and then see what other countries most of their Facebookfriends live in Its fun to see what countries are most connectedto which others but this whole thing brings up the question of degrees of separationIf you were to take 2 random people on Earth how many friend of a friend of a friend ofa friends would you need to connect those 2 peopleWell in the real world its a little difficult to figure out because we dont know whosfriends with who and there are a lot of people But luckily mathematics has come to our rescue Watts and Strogatz showed that you could calculatethe average path between any 2 random people quite easilyIn this equation the N stands for the total number of people in the populationAnd K stands for the number of friends each person hasIf we assume that each person has say 30 friends and we assume that 10 of our populationis too young to have actual friends it turns out that you can connect any two people onEarth with only 66 connections TheoreticallyOf course in the real world we dont all have the same number of friends we dontall have 30 friends and isolated groups make the average much much higherOf course there are nonreal world places where these connections are easier to followFor instance Facebook Last year Facebooks data team released twopapers showing that amongst all Facebook users at the time the average distance betweenany two random users was only 474 friends Twitter is even tighterIts been shown that any two random users of Twitter are connected by only 467 friendsthough some studies have shown it to be as low as 35Numbers like that can make impersonal crowd seem quite intimateBut one of my favorite things about crowds is how smart they areWisdom of the Crowds is a fascinating phenomenon where the collective knowledge or guessesor estimations of a big group of people when averaged are better than one individual personworking alone A good example of this is trying to guesshow many jellybeans are in a jar Some people will overestimate while otherswill underestimate but collectively each member cancels out the errors of the otherand the group average estimation winds up being smarter than the sum of its partsThe BBCs demonstration of this is fantastic Ive linked it down in the description its worth watching They had 160 people guess the number of jellybeans  in a jar The guesses ranged from a few hundred to tensof thousands but the average of all 160 guesses was 4515 only 5 beans away from the exact answer Its amazing to think that in a large enoughgroup the errors and shortcomings of everyone else no matter how annoying they are individuallyactually can balance and correct our own shortcomings It feels good though a little bit strangeto think that in a group its possible for nobody to be correct but for everybody to be right And as always thanks for watching,125.73643410852713,individuallyactually,0.0,1.0,4e_kz79tjb8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e_kz79tjb8
Why Do We Have Two Nostrils?,2012-11-02T00:24:46Z,9.383333333333333,9990354,234486,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd our faces have a lot of holesWe have two ears and two eyes It makes sense because the difference intime it takes for a sound to reach one ear and the other allows us to localize where the sound is coming from And having two eyes gives us twoslightly different perspectives that we can put together in order to perceive depthBut why do we have two nostrilsI mean our sense of smell isnt good enough to localize one nostril over the otherwhy not just have a big hole in our nose like we have a mouthWell Stanford Universitys olfactory research project investigated this and they found thatthroughout the day one nostril inhales air better and faster than the other Now which one is dominantchanges throughout the day but having a good air sucking nostril and a not so good air sucking nostril is importantWe need both because you see odorants and moleculesare absorbed by our skin and snot at different ratesSome things are absorbed so quickly they need to be rushed on the olfactoryreceptors before theyre absorbed earlier on in the noseOther molecules other odorants are slowly absorbed and they need to be given time to get tothe receptors and not just rushed right to the lungs And so having two nostrils allows us to smell more thingsAlright so lets smell some weird stuff like outer spaceWhat would space smell like Okay right its a tough questionit actually doesnt make much sense because space is a mere vacuumIf you went into space and took your helmet off to smell it well all of the air in your lungsand throat nose would be violently sucked right out In fact even if youreally tried to get some sort of olfactory sensation about all youwould feel is the quick evaporation of water coming out of your mucous membranes and you might smellfor the few seconds that you were conscious nasal fluid and bloodThat doesnt sound fun at all But heres the thingObjects that have been taken out into space andthen returned to a habitable atmosphere like inside a space station smell differently than they did before they went into spaceAstronauts report that their suits after being in space have a strange metallic burn meat arc welder fumes smell Its believed that the odor is caused byhigh energy particles that cling to the suit and then once brought inside react with the air creating a burning smellOne particular type of high energy molecule found all over interstellar space are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsThese guys are the result of combustion And in 2004the University of Toledo Ohio found evidence that those very molecules may exist in old nebula The result of convection currents cooling carbon and hydrogen allowing them to bond into giant shapes Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also formed when cooking meat at high temperatures So in order to train astronauts evenmore realistically here on earth NASA actually reached out to StevenPearce of Omega Ingredients to replicate the smell of things thathave been to space as a perfumeIf we know the chemical makeup of something even something light years away from uswe can assemble those ingredients here on earth and get an idea of what it would smell likeRecently researchers have discovered Ethyl Formate in the dust cloud Sagittarius B2Now again if you were to go there and lift up your space suits visor and take a whiff you would die You wouldnt be able to takea whiff all of the air in your nose and lungs and throat would be immediately expelledBut if you were able to take a bucket of Sagittarius B2 home with you to earth and then give it a smellbecause of the ethyl formate Sagittarius B2s stuff would smell like raspberries and rum Pretty neat rightBut lets get closer to home What does the inside of your nose smell like Well its kind of hard to knowbecause we are smelling it all the time and our bodies become desensitized to constant stimuli to keep us frombeing overloaded and to keep us prepared to sense any outof the ordinary smells that we might need to know aboutThis happens to us all the time When you first step into a restaurantyou can smell all the food but halfway through the meal youreno longer aware of the smell Its called neural adaptationI guess the point Im trying to make is that in order to figure out what theinside of a nose smells like youll need to smell a novel one like for instance smell the inside of your friends nose It might seem weird at firstbut it could be a great way to form new memories Our sense of smell may notbe as acute as our other senses but it seems to be tied to memories very very closely A single whiff of an odor can instantlyremind you of where you used to smell that smell and maybe even who you were withThis may be because of the olfactories connection tothe limbic system in the brainOlfactory information is sent through the limbic systemwhich is known to be involved with emotions and memoriesNo other traditional sense is connected to the limbic system in this wayWeve also found that patients who have memory losscaused by brain damage tend to also have an impaired ability to smellSo treasure your sense of smell because it not only keeps us safe from gross odors or rotten food it can also keep us safe from incestIndividuals who are raised together in the same home for thefirst few years of their life whether they are genetically related or not will tend to be less physicallyattracted to each other later in life than they are to strangersThis is known as the Westermarck effect and one of themain mechanisms it works via is the olfactory systemUs humans have an interesting ability to distinguish the smell of a stranger from someone that we are genetically related to or grew up in very close proximity withThis entire phenomenon may be a natural way for us to avoid inbreeding But what about someone who cant smell What do we call themSomeone who cant see is blind someone who cant hear is deaf andsomeone who cant speak is mute but what do you call someone who cant smell Well theres a word for the inability to smell  anosmia Now even though the adjective form is very very rare it existsA person who cant smell is anosmic Theres another word we should haveinvestigated a long time ago OlfactoryWhat does is it come from Well the ol part comes from odor and from smell but factoryWell factories make things but the nose doesnt makes smells it smells smells RightWell heres the thing We smell objects because molecules from those objects react in certain ways with our olfactory receptorsAnd molecules have specific shapes and vibrations and ways of behaving but the smell is not actually intrinsic to the moleculeThe smell is merely a consequence of how that molecule reacts with usNo us no smellSo olfactory is a fantastic wordEvery sight and feeling and sound and smell we getfrom our universe is actually just the universe reacting with usEverything we know about the universe we know because it has already been processedand changed and analyzed and filtered inside the factory of our sense And as always thanks for

What Can You Do Without a Brain?,2012-10-25T00:41:39Z,7.933333333333334,16194012,406976,Hey Vsauce Michael here And subscribing to Vsauce is a nobrainer or is it I mean you would need your brain to understand thewords that I was speaking and you would need your brain to decide whether or not you likedwhat you were hearing You would also need your brain to move your muscles in just theright way to click the subscribe button In fact you need your brain to do a lot of stuff and without a brain well you cant do much of anything at all So literally speakingis there really such a thing as a nobrainer Lets begin with noheadersdecapitationIts a macabre subject I know but whats the matter Are you chicken Ok goodBecause Mike certainly was In 1945 farmer Lloyd Olsen went out to grab a chicken for supperHe cut the chickens head off and it didnt die Mike The Headless Chicken lived for another18 months He toured the country and surprised onlookers He could walk and perch and wasfed by putting little drops of water or pieces of grain down his throat But heres the thingMike The Headless Chickens actions werent a nobrainer because even thoughhe didnt have much of what we would call a head lefthe did have a bit of his brain stem If we want a clearer nobrainer were goingto have to look at an even more simple creature the cockroach These guys dont even breaththrough their heads so without one theyre fine Instead they breath through holes allover their bodies And instead of being controlled by a big massive brain they have littlebundles of nerves ganglia throughout their body and so even without any head partseven when completely decapitated a cockroach can live for weeks It can walk around respondto movement Really its only problem is that without its head it will eventually starve to death Us humans are not nearly as fortunate Withouta head and brain we die within seconds if not instantly But before you get jealouskeep in mind that with our heads intact we are capable of some actions that dont necessarilyrequire the brain reflexes When you snap your finger your finger moves at about 20mph And a really big sneeze can expel air at nearly 3040 mph But nerve impulses theyrereally quick They can clock in at 250 mph but sometimes thats not even fast enoughFor instance if you accidentally put your hand on a hot stove cells are dying quicklyAnd 250 mph doesnt cut it you need to take an action fast Its not worth it to tellyour brain whats happening right away And so instead your immediate reaction to pullaway is mediated by other parts of your nervous system The same can be said for involuntaryand unconscious processes So in a way these unconscious involuntaryor reflexive behaviors could be considered nobrainers But Im not quite satisfiedyet because they still require that your brain be there keeping you alive So what if youwerent alive Well in your dead brainless body your muscle cells still contain a littlebit of energy in the form of ATP Backyard Brains right here on YouTube demonstratesthis with insect parts This leg is no longer connected to a brain or a body but energyremains in the cells And so researchers can detect electrical signals when the legis touched or even simply breathed on Whoa that popping sound youre hearing isthe spontaneous discharge rate of the living neurons in the stillliving leg The muscle cells of a human limb would respondin just the same way But you dont need wires to observe behavior like this Salt can alsodo the trick The introduction of sodium ions can cause a process similar to an actionpotentialin a living animal Salt added to these fresh frog legs makes them dance though not forvery long The cells will eventually run out of energy or simply decay But to be surethere are many other brief candidates for nobrainers at the moment of death For instancemuscles relaxing causing a person to soil themselves Technically a nobrainer Butits a misconception that a corpse continues to grow fingernails and hair Instead itsactually the skin itself shrinking as it dries making hair and nails appear longer But lets take a closer look at these skin cellsbecause we might be on to a quite satisfactory nobrainer Your skin cells live on the peripheryof your body and they dont require a constant stream of new nutrients from your bloodAnd so even though you are dead and your brain is no longer calling the shots your skincells can continue to live gathering nutrients through osmosis and dividing for daysIn fact you can harvest skin cells from a corpse after 24 hours On a related note  digestionSure a lot of the digestive process is completed by you being alive and having a nervous system thatworks But part of the work is done by bacteria that just happens to live inside your gutAnd when youre dead or your brain is gone theyll continue digestingSo in a way making poop at least part of that process is a nobrainer But heres the thing These bacteria thatlive inside you are foreign bacteria Are they you For that matter what about theskin cells that can continue to live after youre dead Are they you or are they merely cellsthat you have made a good home for Were getting pretty philosophical here becausewere basically asking if you are merely your brain and everything else that goes on whenyou no longer have one is just other stuff that you arent doing You could argue that without a brain your bodyno longer has your intentions It no longer does things because you have decided to do themIn other words a nobrainer may be impossible for you to dobecause it requires not using you If you are merely what your brain does andnot what your cells do off on their own when the brain is gone then in a way being youbeing alive is a yesbrainer Another great yesbrainer is

Why Are Things Cute?,2012-10-15T00:37:50Z,5.833333333333333,7666164,163551,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd The Pet Collective offers 24hour coverage of puppies and kittensIts really cute But what is cute scientificallyI mean why do we like soft cuddly things and why do cute things have a unique effect on us Well the word cute is a shortening of acutewhich originally meant keen shrewd perceptive About 180 years ago the word cute began tobe used as slang for a girl who was pretty And after that it accrued a new meaning andwas used to describe cuddly delicate quaint precious youthful traitsKonrad Lorenz studies cuteness in living things and put together a great specific list ofwhat we consider cute Small body size with a disproportionatelylarge head large eyes and round and soft body featuresBut why exactly did these characteristics elicit an ooooohhh response from us humansWell Lorenz pointed that you could find all of those characteristics in the human babywhich makes sense If merely looking at our offspring makes usinstinctively feel protective and nurturing well thats great for all of usA fun consequence of this is that our experience of cuteness can be triggered by things thatarent human babies For instance shells bunnies owls and even a hammer A hammer how can that beTake a look at this interactive tool from the ExploratoriumA hammer is boring But if we apply Lorenzs traits and make itreally round and really squat it goes from a utilitarian tool to a cute little tiny hammerOh hes just a little hammer dont hurt him It is a hammer that has become cute because we gave it qualities that we see in our own offspring As Daniel Dennett puts it if human babieslooked like this instead of that we would find this cuteAnd whenever we saw something that looked like it we would wanna cuddle and snuggle with it Alright so we have a pretty good idea aboutthe how and what of cute But where is cuteWell researchers have shown cute baby pictures to subjects while using functional MRI totrack activity in the brain And sure enough the cuter the baby in thepicture the more activation found right here  the nucleus accumbensA pleasure centre When activated the nucleus accumbens releases dopamine Its all part of our internal reward systemIts the same part of the brain targeted by cocaine and methCuteness is such a powerful force on the brain in fact that it can affect our behaviours what we like what we buy And so its no coincidence that the creatorsof cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse or Pikachu have drawn them moreand more cute over time The Japanese concept of Kawaii is a greatexample of this and its one thats fun to quantify If youre an adult how many of your own heads stacked on top of each other do you thinkit would take to equal your height The answer for most of us is around 75But illustrations of people that are meant to make them look heroic or noble tend tomake the person around 8 to 85 heads high Cute goes the other wayManga characters tend to only be about 55 to 65 heads tall Back to babies There are many other psychological factorsat work that cause us to want to instinctively take care of our youngAnd to be sure some of them are decidedly not cuteFor instance poopy diapers Researchers have found that mothers whenexposed to soiled diapers tend to consider the smell coming from their own childs diaperto be the least terrible despite not knowing which diaper belonged to which kidWhen something retains juvenile traits all the way through adulthood it is called neotenyAnd we love it especially in animals that we keep as petsOf course us humans have selectively bred all kinds of animals to make each generationmore and more useful to us But the dog may be the animal thatve spentthe most time designing making each generation better at hunting or better at staying cuter for longer Dogs like this have been designed by us tolook grow and behave in ways that we want Not that dissimilar from how we would designsay a DVD player and its features So whether its staying cute forever or justbeing a really great hunting companion the modern dog more than any other animal couldbe considered not so much a consequence of nature as much as it is a piece of human technologyAs Science Friday puts it the dog is mans best friend because it may be mans best inventionSo go pet a cute dog today And as always thanks for watching,129.25714285714287,disproportionatelylarge,0.0,1.0,Z0zConOPZ8Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0zConOPZ8Y
How Much Does a Shadow Weigh?,2012-10-08T00:02:25Z,7.65,11998869,240709,Hey Vsauce Michael here And Im sure thatwe all love to have fun with hand shadows but how much does a shadow weigh It might sound like a silly question becauseit is I mean a shadow cannot be put on a scale and weighed But the material thatit falls on top of can be weighed And we know that light has energy In fact whenlight encounters an object it pushes that object just a little bit On the surface ofEarth when sunlight is hitting it every square inch is being pushed with a force ofabout onebillionth of a pound which is basically nothing But over a large enough surfacearea the results can be pretty fun On a sunny day the city of Chicago weighs300 pounds more simply because sunlight is falling on it pushing it In outer space where solar wind isnt filteredby Earths atmosphere or magnetic field the results are even bigger A space craft travelingfrom Earth to Mars would be pushed by light 1000 km off course So these things haveto be factored into journeys to Mars Weve actually already created things that can sailwith light giant reflective solar sails that are pushed by the Suns light So in a way that is calculable though difficultto measure an area covered in shadow technicaly weighs less than surrounding areas being pushedby light But enough about the Sun There are 3 astronomicalbodies that can cast shadows on the surface of Earth bright enough for us humans to seeOne is obviously the Sun and the other is the MoonBut whats the third Venus Pete Lawrence investigated this over a digitalsky Now to make sure that the shadow he saw was caused by Venus he used a tube thatcould be pointed at specific regions in the sky Inside the tube he put a cutout shapedlike the astronomical symbol for Venus Now here is light coming through the tubewhen pointed just adjacent to Venus at a point in the sky relatively dark and empty tothe human eye But here is what came out of the tube when pointed at Venus  a  Venusian shadow We all know that light travels quickly  299792458 metres per seconds  c But this light right here in fact the lightcoming off your screen into your eyeballs right now is moving slightly slower thanc because c is the speed of light in a vacuum but all of this light if having to travelthrough a medium in this case air The speed of light in air is everso slightlyslower than c 298925574 ms This is interesting because light travels more slowlythrough different materials but c remains the universal speed limit and as long asan object doesnt go that fast it can still outpace light in a material A charged particle for instance an electroncan travel through water faster than light does but never faster than c When thishappens we get something analogous to a sonic boom We get a Photonic Boom In a sonic boom the sound information propagatingoff of the object is in the form of compression waves and as the object gets closer and closerto the speed of sound the speed that those waves are moving away from it at each newwave has less time to get out of the way of the next until eventually the waves collapseall into each other and the denisty and pressure is enormous causing a sonic boom Normally when a charged particle moves througha material whose molecules can be polarized the molecules give off photons But each photonhas room to fly away and the waves all destructively interfere with each otherso no radiation is given off But the faster the particle goes the lessroom the photons have away from each other and their waves begin to constructively interferegiving off a photonic boom  Cherenkov Radiation Astronauts especially those who have gonealltheway to the Moon have reported seeing flashes of light Many people attribute thisto highspeed particles moving through the liquid inside their eye faster than lightnormally would causing photonic booms right inside their body Speaking of the speed of light heres a greatquestion a few of you have sent me It involves a possible way of going faster than cHeres how it goes Lets say I want to push a button that isa lightyear away from me which means that it would take light the fastest possiblething in the universe a year just to get from me to the button Ok well what if I built a board one lightyearlong alltheway from me to the button and then I pushed one end of the boardWould the other end immediately push the button And if so did I just break the speed oflight Did I just send information faster than light Well were not talking aboutthe speed of light anymore are we We are talking about the speed of push When you push a rigid object what you arereally doing is putting a series of compression waves through the object which move at thespeed of sound in the objects material The information about whoa weve been pushedyou should move is sent via that compression wave and it only travels at the speed of soundSo when pushing a normal daytoday size type object it feels almost instantaneousBut when pushing a lightyearlong board it would take a lot longer A cool way to see this in action is to lookat an object in which compression waves travel more slowly For instance what Veritasiumhas done blowing minds by showing Slinkys being dropped The information telling theSlinky that hey uh were moving travels through the Slinky slow enough that a slowmocamera can see it happen If you havent watched all of VeritasiumsSlinky videos youve missed out In fact you should watch all of their stuff it is superbBut to wrap things up heres the point The speed of push is not instant andits certainly not the speed of light But light can push you In fact technicallyyou weigh more when the lights are on than you do when the lights are off Ive put links in the description to all kindsof cool things you should definitely check out for fun and for science And as always thanks for

How Hot Can It Get?,2012-09-29T18:23:50Z,10.05,21780764,440328,Hey Vsauce Michael here And my tea is quite hotbut its not the hottest thing in the universe So what isI mean we know that there is an absolute zero but is there an absolute hotA point at which something is so hot it cant get any hotterWell to find out lets begin with the human bodyYour internal temperature is not constant37 degrees 986 Sure But those are averagesYour bodys internal temperature fluctuates by about one degree Fahrenheit  half a degree Celsius  throughout the day in a cycle Assuming you sleep at night at 430 in the morning your body reaches its coolest naturalhealthy temperature And at 7 pm it reaches its highest But a dangerous fever is not good 108 degrees Fahrenheit is almost always lethalThe highest recorded air temperature across all of Earth has happened four times in Death Valley where it has reached 129 degrees Fahrenheit180 degrees Fahrenheit is the recommended temperature for water when brewing coffeeAnd at 210 degrees Fahrenheit a cake is done 2000 degrees Fahrenheit is thetemperature of lava fresh outta the groundBut come on Make your own lava like Green Science Pro This guy usesFresnel lenses to focus the suns energy onto whatever he wantsThis is a small piece of obsidian volcanic glass which he can melt into actual lava right in his backyardKeep in mind that the Sun is having that effect even though it is 93 million miles away from EarthRight up on the surface of the Sun is a different story The surface clocks in at 10000 degrees Fahrenheit but the centre where fusion occurs is ridiculous Temperatures there reach 28 million degrees Fahrenheit which is also known as 15 million KelvinThe Kelvin scale has units that are the same size as a Celsius degree but its an absolute scale where 0 is absolute zero When matter reachestemperatures as high as those found in the centre of the Sun an enormous amount of energy is radiated awayIf you were to heat only the head of a pin to the temperature of the centre of the Sun it would kill any person within 1000 miles of it Speaking of which the energy emitted by an object often tells us a lot about the temperature of that objectAny object over absolute zero emits some form of electromagnetic radiation You and me we dont glow visibly but we do emit infrared lightWe cant see it but infrared cameras canWBT has great videos and here he is hiding inside an opaque black trash bagNow we cant see him but his body is infraredly glowing through itIf you want something to be the right temperature to glow in the visible spectrum youll have to reach the Draper point about 798 KalvinAt this point almost any object will begin to glow a dead red We can calculate the expected wavelength of radiation coming off of an object because of itstemperature and that wavelength gets smaller and smaller the hotter andhotter the object gets It goes from radio waves to microwavesup through infrared divisible all the way to xrays and gammarayswhich are created in the middle of our SunAt temperatures as hot as the Sun matter exists in a fourth stateNot solid not liquid not gas but instead a state where the electronswander away from the nuclei plasma If youve watched my temperaturelean back you know that you could make plasma by microwaving fire But dont do it Besides our Sun isnteven close to being the hottest thing in the universe I mean sure 15 million Kelvin is pretty incredible but the peak temperature reached duringa thermonuclear explosion is 350 million Kelvin which hardly countsbecause the temperature is achieved so brieflyBut inside the core of a star 8 times larger than our Sun on the last day of its lifeas it collapses in on itself you would reach a temperature of 3 billion KelvinOr if you wanna be cool 3 GigaKelvinBut lets get hotter At 1 TeraKelvin things get weird Remember that plasma we were talkingabout that the Sun is made of Well at 1 TeraKelvin the electronsarent the only thing that wander away The hedrons themselves the protons andneutrons in the nucleus melt into quirks and gluons a sort of soupBut how hot is a TeraKelvinFrighteningly hot Theres a star named WR 104 about 8000 light years away from us Its mass is the equivalent of 25 of our Suns and when it dies when it collapses its internaltemperature will be so great that the energy emittedthe gamma radiation it flings out into space will be stronger than the entire amountof energy our Sun will ever create in its entire lifetime Gamma ray bursts are quite narrow so Earth is most likely safebut what if it wasnt Well when WR 104 collapses even though Earth is 4702 trillion miles away the energy it releases would still be bad newsExposure for 10 seconds would mean losing a quarter of Earths ozone layer resulting in mass extinction food chain depletion and starvation from 8000 light years awayCloser to home right here on earth in Switzerlandscientists have been able to smash protons into nuclei resulting in temperatures much larger than 1 TeraKelvinTheyve been able to reach the 2 to 13 ExaKelvin range But we are okay because those temperatures last for an incredibly brief moment and onlyinvolve a small number of particles Remember how we couldcalculate the wavelength of the radiation emitted by an object based on its temperature Well if an object were to reach a temperature of 141 times 10 to the 32 Kelvin the radiation it would admit wouldhave a wavelength of 1616 times 10 to the 26th nano meters which is tiny Like so tiny it actually has a special name It is the Planck distancewhich according to quantum mechanics is the shortest distance possible in our universe Okay well what if we added even more energyWouldnt the wavelength get smaller Its supposed to but yet it cantThis is where weve got a problem Above 141 times 10 to 32 Kelvin the Planck temperatureour theories dont work The object would become hotter than temperatureIt would be so hot that what it is would not be considered a temperature Theoretically there is nolimit to the amount of energy we could keep adding into the systemWe just dont know what would happen if it got hotter than the Planck temperatureClassically you could argue that that much energy inone place would instantly cause a black hole to form And a black hole formed from energyhas a special name  a KugelblitzSo basically what Im trying to say is when you want to tell someone youlike that you think they are hot so hot that not even science canunderstand it just call them a KugelblitzFinally here is something funThe Sun is about 47 billion years oldabout halfway through its life cycle and so far it has burned 100 Earths worth of fuel which sounds like a lot but the Sun is the size of 300000 Earths Because of that discrepancy you canhave a lot of mathematical fun comparing your energy output to the SunsThe Sun is way hotter than us and it puts out way more energy than usBad Astronomy had a lot of fun with this one and although it doesnt really meananything it is technically true because of the Suns enormous size that one cubic centimeter of human puts out more energy than an average cubic centimetre of the SunWhich should make you feel quite warm inside И как всегда спасибо за смотрящийI kak vsegda  spasibo za smotryashchiyAnd as always thanks for

Why Did The Chicken Cross The Road?,2012-09-17T00:36:32Z,8.283333333333333,10936118,240490,Hey Vsauce Michael here Ive got a question for youWhy did the chicken cross the road Brilliant question Lets find out why Historically the chicken crossed the roadto get to the other side Has anybody ever laughed at that joke Why has it become sofamous And for that matter who cares Why would you want to investigate why things arefunny As EB White said analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog  few people areinterested and the frog dies But I want to dive into the guts of this chickenjoke because today it is so famous it is practically shorthand for comedy And peoplefrequently consider it either the worst joke of all time or the oldest jokeBut neither of those is true But first things first The chicken jokeisnt technically even a joke Its an antijoke Its a joke about jokes You see we expecta joke to surprise us to flip things around or use word play But to get to the otherside is just obvious its mundane which by itself can be pretty funny To make thismore clear lets take a look at antijoke chicken Whats blue and smells like redpaint Blue paint You see you expect a typical jokey punch line but instead whatyou get is hilariously serious AntiJoke Cat is another good one Knock knock Whosthere Lettuce Thats impossible Yo mommas so fat we are all extremely concernedfor her health Antijokes can also be used for psychological experiments right at homeYou may have heard of this one already the no soap radio joke Heres how it worksGet a couple of your friends together and tell them to all laugh when youre done tellingthe joke no matter what Then go find a target whos not in on it and tell them someversion of a joke like this Two polar bears were sitting in a bathtub The first one sayspass the soap The second one says no soap radio At this point you and your friendsshould start laughing uproariously meaning the target has one of two choices eitherbe afraid of looking dumb and laugh along anyway or say theyre confused at whichpoint you should tell them what you dont get it and keep laughing You wait untilthe target gives into peer pressure and succumbs to mob mentality and joins despite the factthat no soap radio is actually nonsense As for being the oldest joke in the bookwhy did the chicken cross the road is far from it Tts only about 160 some oddyearsold It first appeared in print in The Knickerbocker as a conundrum that really isnt one  an antijokeIf you want to look for the oldest joke ever to appear in print were going to have togo back 4000 years to read some ancient Sumerian proverbs The joke is essentially a cautionary taleto never expect anything to be perfect It goes like this Something which has neveroccurred since time immemorial a young woman did not fart in her husbands embrace Soyeahthe earliest known joke is a joke about a woman farting in a guys lap Socool All Im sure of is that our proverbial chickendid not have Agyrophobia Thats the fear of crossing streets But maybe the chicken should haveI mean crossing the road could be quite dangerous for a little bird which leads us to a quitedarker interpretation of the joke Maybe this chicken knew of the danger of crossing theroad Maybe he knew what could happen Maybe he was sad or lonely or knew what his fatewas And so he decided to take control and end it himself and crossed the road to get to the other side If you want to continue being morbid checkout DeathClockcom Answer a few questions and the site will generate a countdown ofthe number of seconds you likely have left to live You can just sit there and watchthem tick away But lets get back to the joke Perhaps a better question than why did thechicken cross the road is why wouldnt chickens be crossing the road I mean to be surethe Earth is a big place and less than 1 percent of it is even paved but there arequite a few chickens on Earth To put this in perspective there are about500 million cats and as far as we go there are 7 billion humans But chickensThere are 24 billion chickens Were outnumbered more than 31 But if we cooked up everysingle chicken alive on Earth right now we could fill enough KFC 16piece buckets toform a stack of them going to the Moon and back three times Unbelievable rightI mean they all fit so nicely here on Earths surface walking around with their characteristicallylean meat which because fat contributes so much more flavor to a piece of meat than themuscle does may explain why chicken is such a great generic meat flavor and why so manyother exotic meats we try later tend to taste like chicken But lets get back to the question in thisvideos title Why did the chicken cross the road Well to get to the other side surebut there are many different motivations a chicken could have for going to the otherside Maybe it was looking for food maybe it was being chased by a predator What mattersthough is that we can never know because there is no chicken Its purely hypothetical asopposed to the equally famous Mary Had a Little Lamb in which the lamband Mary were real people Mary Sawyer was an actual student at The RedstoneSchool in Massachusetts and one day her brother encouraged her to bring her lamb to schoolHer fellow students were amused as was visiting student John Roulstonewho wrote Mary Had a Little Lamb We have actual documentation of those realpeople and events but this chicken never even really existed So asking why the chickencrossed the road is just like asking why did the original writer decide that it shouldbe a chicken crossing a road Which means that the chicken crossed the road because somecomedian in the 19th century decided that you would probably think about it too muchmaking the mundane to get to the other side answer quite surprising To explain this lets look at a computationalneural explanation of humor In order to effectively manage resources our brains stay a few stepsahead of what were hearing estimating what kind of outcomes are possible But when wediscover that were actually being told a joke and none of our paths were the correctversion of what was being told all of that neural network energy needs to dissipateand according to some theorists that energy moves into motor cortexcausing convulsions  laughter Unfortunately our poor chicken friend doesntillicit that response from us anymore because weve all heard the joke We know what toexpect when the joke begins But we should be proud of our chicken friend and the unknownauthor who thought him up because even though the joke is so famous its no longer funnyeven at a neurological level it still stands as a testament to just how complicated andclever our comedy can be Keep laughing And as always thanks for

This Is Not Yellow,2012-09-02T23:10:49Z,7.15,22948307,320925,Using GPS these trails represent pizza deliveryin Manhattan on a typical Friday night And is this a frog or a orse Its episode 52 of IMG This lemon looks yellow to me and it probablylooks yellow to you as well but not in the same way You see here in this roomthis lemon is Subtractively Yellow It absorbs all visible wavelengths of light except foryellow light which it reflects onto my retina But the screen that you are using to watchthis video doesnt produce yellow light at all In fact it can only produce red blueor green light The really cool but kind of disturbing thing about this is that herein the room I am actually seeing real yellow light But you are seeing fake yellow Absolutelyno yellow is coming off your screen and falling onto your retina But it still looks yellowbecause its quite easy to lie to the brain Our retinas contain three different typesof cone cells that are receptive to color and each one is best suited to detect a certaincolor One is great for blue the other is great for green and the third is great forred Notice that there is no individual cell looking for yellow So the way we actuallysee yellow happens like this The wavelength of yellow light falls between the wavelengthsof red and green And so when an object reflects yellow light onto your retina boththe green and the red cones are slightly activated which your brain notices and says well thatswhat happens when somethings yellow so it must be yellow All a computer monitor or a mobile phone screenhas to do to make you think youre seeing yellow is send a little bit of red and a littlebit of green light at you As long as the pixels and the little subpixels on them aresmall enough that you cant distinguish them individually your brain will just say wellIm recieving some red and some green thats what yellow things dohmmit must be yellowEven though it actually is not Lemons can also produce electricity A littlebit of zinc a little bit of copper and boom youre moving electrons around But not thatmany I mean the current voltage are quite lowYou could run an LCD but even a potato could do that If you wanted to run a flashlight bulb thatwould take 3000 lemons And if you wanted to run a halogen bulb well that would take37000 lemons But artist Caleb Charland doesnt care He spent 11 hours hammering nails into 300living apples hanging on trees By connecting them to a household lamp he was able to makeit glow just dimly enough to capture this image with a 4 hour exposure Less alive and more frightening are

lightbulbs heatand drips into a special container into all kinds of weird new shapes but whenever youwant you can just flip it so that the new cooled wax is at the top But my favorite is the Fukusada

Hoong blew my mind this weekWeve got clear days and smoke boats and crocs whales and hearts Piebike brainsand boxing gloves day and night but dont be scared you can always paint yourself somelight Or

beingalive when certain things happened For instance he calculated using data from the US CensusBureau that 2012 this very year is the first year in American history since in whichfewer than half of living Americans remember being alive in the 1970s By 2041 most of us wont remember a timewhen Pluto was actually called a planet By 2043 most of us alive wont remember livingduring George W Bushs

Guns in Space,2012-08-26T21:46:04Z,5.483333333333333,20268567,234432,Hey Vsauce Michael here And what do yousay we get outta hereto space and into an orbit That way we could just float aroundand be free from the influence of gravity Except not really Astronauts orbiting around the Earth experiencepretty much the same gravitational pull that you and I are feeling right now The majordifference is that those astronauts are falling constantly towards Earth but their angularvelocity is so large that theyre falling just as fast as Earth curves away from them Nowof course this is nothing Newtons Cannon hasnt already taught us Gravity makes stuff fall and in particularNewton realized that it makes objects accelerate towards the Earth the same amount independentlyof how fast theyre moving horizontally Thats called relativity And of course orbitingis just falling but falling where you move horizontally fast enough that the earth fallsaway faster In order to successfully fall and miss the Earth unless you dug a tunnelyou need to be travelling at over 17000 mph or 8 km every second So youd probablyincinerate from friction with the air well before you had a chance to enjoy the trip Of course Newtons thought experiment involvedthe Earth but on something smaller like the Moon the cannon wouldnt have to throwits projectile nearly as fast for it to complete an orbit In fact if you had a powerful enoughgun on the Moon and you fired that gun at the horizon and then waited a little bityou could get hit in the back of the head by the same bullet Henry calculated that the bullet would haveto travel about 1600 ms which is exactly how fast the Paris gun fires Now thats a powerful gun its no squirtgun But if you had a squirt gun out there in space and you fired a stream of waterat the Sun how much water would it take to put out the Sun I mean in general puttingwater on something hot would cause that something hot to lose some heat especially since thewater will be frozen because its out there in space But heres the issue The Sun isnot a big ball of hydrogen on fire Instead the Sun is powered by fusion Fusion of Hydrogen nuclei which is kind oflike the chemical bonds between the Hydrogen and Oxygen that make up water except on amuch smaller and much more powerful scale Now before I get tackled by nuclear physicistsfrom one side and chemists from the other let me explain A bond of any sort whether between planetsmolecules atoms nuclei or quarks is just a happenstance where two or more particlestogether have a lower total energy than when they were apart Like if you get marriedand your taxes go down So when you form a bond that extra energy that the two solitaryparticles had is released and because of a little relation we called Emc² thisactually means that the mass of the pair goes down a little bit too For example every fusion reactions turnsa little bit of Hydrogenous mass into light Sunlight for example amounts to a loss of100 quadrillion kg each year Thats the equivalent of a medium sized asteroid But stars havea lot of mass and the more massive a star is the hotter it burns And adding a bunchof water to the Sun would only cause it to be more massive so it would burn brighternot go out Of course it would also burn faster which means that its life would be shorter For instance if you were to add 20 solarmasses of water to the Sun you would decrease its life expectancy from the current 5 billionyears to only a few hundred million more years But theres a faster way to put out the SunTake that water or whatever material you want and shoot it into the Sun in a way thatcauses everything to get spread out and scattered so that theres no longer the critical densityneeded for fusion to occur Now no matter which avenue of putting out the Sun you pickboth would be a disaster Literally disaster From Dis meaning against and astermeaning star you would have literally turned our own star against us If you were somehow able to avoid that disasterby magically appearing in intergalactic space heres a fun experiment to try Take out yourgun and fire a bullet That bullet will be forever alone Thats because the universe is expandingand if you were a few megaparsecs away from the nearest galactic cluster on average thosegalaxies would be 200 km father away from you every passing second In space terms200 km per second is pretty slow Its barely as fast as the solar system orbits the centerof the Milky Way And stars closer to the center of the galaxy can orbit 10 times fasterBut a measly bullet travels only a few km every second and would have no chance of reachingthe receding galaxies ever It makes you realize how tiny we are comparedto the scale of the universe But it also makes you realize how close together we allare here on Earth Of course to get from one side of the Earth to the other you haveto fly over half the sphere So what if instead there was a tunnel throughthe Earth Lets jump over to my channel Minute Physics to see what happensClick here and Ill see you on the other side Oh and as always thanks for

What If Everyone JUMPED At Once?,2012-08-19T03:28:52Z,7.216666666666667,39974441,765027,Hey Vsauce Michael here And what if everysingle person on Earth jumped at the exact same time Could it cause an earthquake orwould we not even be able to tell Well first things firstlets talk about the Earths rotation The Earth spins thats why we have nightand day and it spins quickly At the equator the Earth is spinning at more than 1000 MPH Now a spinning ice skater can speed up bymoving mass closer to the center and the Earth is no different In fact if you getdown on the ground right now and move your mass closer to Earths center technicallyyou will speed up Earths rotation making this day shorter Now the change that you would make to theEarths rotation is way smaller than we could even measure but it is calculable and theimpact can be quite impressive when you talk about redistributing more mass than just one person For instance last year the earthquake inJapan redistributed so much of Earths mass towards the center that every day since thenhas been 18 microseconds shorter But that was a giant geological event Whatcan us humans do to the Earth all on our own I mean there are more than 7 billion of usnow What if we all got together in one place and jumped Well what would that even look like Interestingly if you took the entire humanpopulation of Earth and had them all live in one place with the same density that peoplelive in in New York City you could fit everyone  all of us  into the state of Texas But thats living not standing around ina crowd which is how we would probably want to do the jump If every single person alive right now onEarth stood shoulder to shoulder you could fit all of us into the city of Los AngelesIt would be an incredible sight to behold  a mere 500 square miles containingevery single person on Earth Ok so then we jump What happens Unfortunately not much I mean were allawesome people here on Earth but our collective mass compared to the mass of the entire EarthIts like nothing In fact Dot Physics calculated that if allof us were to get together in one location and all jump 30 cm into the air at the exactsame time we would push Earth away from us a tiny amount Earth would only move away from us about 1100thof the width of a single Hydrogen Atom And heres another thing Because were all jumpingand then going back to where we started Earth is just going to move back to where it started So our big jump wont be able to change Earthsposition in space but cmon 7 billion people all jumping together Thats gotta be ableto cause some sort of seismic activity right So lets say you have a lot of people alltogether in one place and you have them all jump on 123 Did you feel that Well the BBC did thiswith 50000 people and discovered that a kilometer and a half away it only registereda 6 on the Richter scale You would need 7 million times more people than even liveon Earth right now to jump at once to recreate the earthquake that recently happened in Japan So even though were all awesome comparedto the size of the Earth were not much But dont get too discouraged Our collectivejump would contain a lot of energy The Straight Dope calculated that even if only the peoplewho lived in China got together and jumped their jump would be the equivalent of 500tons of TNT Of course 500 tons of TNT doesnt do much to an Earth that weighs6 sextillion 588 quintillion tons To make yourself feel more powerful picka card Ive got 10 of them here lets say hmmm you choose this one Boom congratulationswe have just decimated this deck of cards Why Well because technically decimate doesnot mean obliterate completely Deci10 It means to take away 110th of somethingSo the next time you take a quiz and dont do so well on it you only get 10 Well surethats an F but by getting 10 of them right you DECIMATED that quiz And since weve been talking about crowdslets talk about YouTube crowds YouTube audiences that view count that you see at the bottomof every video and get some perspective on it Well being with Dunbars Number Its an estimation of the maximum number ofpeople we can have stable social relationships with at a given momentand its based on the size of our neocortex These arent just acquaintances these arepeople you have social contact with  a network where you know how everyone relates to everyoneelse And the number is usually given to be somewhere between 100230 which means that whena YouTube video receives more than 230 views from different people more people have seenthat video than you could ever realistically hope to know well at a given moment If a video has more than 100000 views fromdifferent people more people have seen that video than you will ever meet in your lifeAnd by meet I mean shakes hands with learn their name talk with them for a bit I mean think of it this way You and mewere only statistically expected to live around 28470 days So even if you were to meetsomeone 23 people every day of your life including when you were a baby you stillwouldnt meet as many people as have seen that YouTube video with 100000 views But keep this in mind Even though you oreven a large group of us cant do much to change Earths location or rotation we canaffect it a little bit Newtons Third Law guarantees this If you weigh 150 poundsthe Earth is pulling you down with a force of 150 pounds But you are also pulling upon the Earth with a force of 150 pounds If you fall 3 meters the Earth has pulledyou down 3 meters But you have also exerted a equal and opposite force on the EarthOf course its a lot bigger So if you fall 3 meters you pull the Earth up about a billionthof the width of a proton which aint bad So the next time you move your body the nexttime you jump Felicia think about this You just affected the Earth as much as itaffected you Youve got that kind of power Speaking of power you all should go checkout Geek  Sundry Felicias new channel Its one of my new favorite things And as

What Color Is A Mirror?,2012-08-03T23:16:51Z,5.033333333333333,17652974,278988,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd today we are going to talk about color Green Green Green GreenGold on let me just Pink this up Yellow Michael Orange you going to come to theconcert this evening I Red about that there are going to bea lot of Purple there I didnt Teal you about this earlier Well look I have to go Brown town firstbut Ill be White Black Colors Did you know that the human eye can differentiate10 million different colors But what color is a mirror You might say silver because mirrors areoften illustrated that way and to be sure they are made out of silver or silvery thingslike aluminium But a mirror in reality is whatever color you point it at In this Green Room the mirror is green Andif you look inside a mirror it becomes youcolored An object is whatever color it doesnt absorbThese sticky notes are orange because when hit with typical white light they absorbevery other wavelength of visible light except for orange which they diffuse into your eye balls But a perfect mirror reflects all colors equallySo in a way you could say that a mirror is white except a mirror doesnt reflectcolors in the same way that pigment does A mirror reflects incoming light in a singleoutgoing direction  specular reflection not diffuse This kind of reflection creates animage of the very thing in front of the mirror So as Bad Astronomy jokesa mirror is more of a smart white But wait a second that is a perfect mirrorand we live in the real world where there are no perfect mirrors Every mirror absorbsa little bit of light not enough that it matters I mean it looks pretty clear tome but when you take a look at the spectrum of light reflected by a typical mirror youwill find that it best reflects light within the 510 nanometer range which we perceiveas green light So technically a mirror is a tiny tiny tiny bit green You may have noticed this yourselfwhen investigating a Mirror Tunnel This happens when two mirrors face each otherreflecting the same scene back and forth and back and forth and back and forth Witheach new reflection a little bit more visual light is lost but green least of all Thatswhy the reflection way down the tunnel is dimmer and greener So maybe real world mirrors arent smartwhite theyre actually kind of green but we should talk about white En español white es blanco En français white est dit blanc And in English we have a word that comesfrom the same route Black which is the opposite of white How did that happen Well it turns out that all of those wordscome from the same ancient ProtoIndoEuropean root word Bhleg which meant shine burnflash Some languages took it to mean the brightness of the flash white While otherstook it to mean whats left behind the burned black darkness If you have blue eyes your eyes arent actuallyblue in the sense that the molecules inside them are absorbing all other wavelengths ofvisible light and diffusing the blue No no no instead your eyes are blue for thesame reason that the sky is blue interference In our sky light from the Sun encountersmolecules of air and because of the size of those molecules light of longer wavelengthscan slip on by but shorter wavelengths crash into the particles like blue light and scatterwhich is why we see blue when we look at the sky away from the Sun Without the air molecules that space wouldjust be black And when direct sunlight has to travel through a lot of air almost allof the colors get scattered out except for the longest wavelengths the red which iswhat gives a sunrise and a sunset their color The iris of your eyeball contains a hazy layerwhere light can be scattered just like the sky Through a similar but slightly differentprocess shorter wavelengths are scattered more making your eyes look blue unlessof course you have some melonen in that iris in which case your eyes are going to begreen hazel or brown Enjoy those colors And as always thanks for watching,137.4834437086093,encountersmolecules,0.0,1.0,-yrZpTHBEss,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrZpTHBEss

SCIENCE! What is the Rarest Precious Metal?,2012-07-03T19:06:48Z,7.183333333333334,12455275,224398,Hey VsauceMichael here And Im in Anaheim at VidConI hope to see some of you here because I like you guysBut I cant marry all of you But if I did put a ring on it what is themost precious thing you could make that ring out ofSilver gold platinum Those are all fine but I wanna know whatis the rarest most scarce thing on Earth thats stable and safe to wear I could makethat ring out of And I want it to be pureIm talking elemental Well luckily I recently went to the Universityof Nottingham home of Periodic Videos and experimented with some elementsFirst things first zinc dissolved in mercury This stuff is awesome its dense its heavyits liquid metal Its cool but even cooler is human urineThank you Neil Of course I am just kiddingThis is an aqueous solution of the metal vanadium And when we mix vanadium in with the mercuryand the zinc the mercury helps the zinc give electrons to the vanadiumAnd is it gains more and more electrons it changes colourWere looking for purple I love shaking this its crazy its likethrowing me off balance Its so heavyLook at that Thank you electrons Those colours were beautiful but vanadium is not that rareI wanna get something more precious And how about precious personally like my dad Hes a chemical engineer who specificallyworks with and has a patent concerning one elementSulphur Of course a fun thing to do with sulphur isto make it bark like a dog Heres what were gonna doWere gonna take a glass tube and fill it with laughing gas nitrous oxideWere gonna pour a little bit of water into the tube to cushion and protect the tube andthen were gonna pour in some liquid carbon disulphideIts very volatile and will evaporate giving us a mixture of gases inside this tubeFinally I will light the top of the tube causing the carbon disulphide to burnAnd as it burns the temperature and pressure in the tube will increase causing the reactionto go faster and faster Itll accelerate and bark Wow And look at all the sulphur on the sides of the tube That reaction was fun and cool and colourfulbut were way off track here Even though sulphur is precious and dear tomy heart its not that rare at all So lets get crazy and talk about astatineAstatine is so rare here on Earth that we dont even know what it looks likeIf you were to try to get enough astatine atoms together that you could see it withyour own eyes it would instantly vaporise itself because of its radioactive heatThe fact that its so radioactive means it wouldnt be great as a ring so lets moveon to something a little bit more standard and see where it takes usGold Gold of course is famous for its unreactivitywhich is why its a great way to store your wealthIf you have a lot of gold laying around the likelihood that it will combine with otherelements and dissolve or rust or corrode is basically zerowith the exception of some special solutions In particular one discovered in 1300s withthe fancy name aqua regia Its made out of hydrochloric acid and nitricacid and were about to make some right now thanks to Neil from Periodic VideosOf course were using this fume cover because the fumes that come off the nitric acid arequite dangerous Its the gas NO2 and if you inhale it nitricacid forms in your lungs So instead of doing that lets put some goldin aqua regia Were just gonna use this ancient pricelessEgyptian relic Lets go ahead and try this outAs the gold dissolves what we wind up with in the evaporating dish is chloroauric acidAuric coming from aurum the Latin word for gold which is why golds symbol on the periodictable is Au Its really sad to watch that gold dissolve away I wish there was a way for us to just makeother things into gold Now I know what youre thinkingMichael thats alchemy But alchemy is quite realIn todays particle accelerators we can smash particles together creating elementsAt the accelerator collider at GSI they can create gold by smashing particles togetherat a rate of 2 million gold atoms every second Thats pretty cool rightWell as you know atoms are incredibly small Theyre so small that even though GSI canmake 2 million new gold atoms every single second were they to leave the machine onat that rate for 50 million years they would only produce 1 gram of goldGold is rare and precious and expensive But gold is 40 more common than iridiumAnd iridium is incredibly resilient It doesnt dissolve in aqua regia and itsnot even attacked by molten metals or silicates at high temperature which is nice and  butnot as pretty as cerium which reacts at high temperature to form beautiful little sparklesAs we continue our journey to discover the rarest thing to make a ring out of wevegot to discuss osmium This stuff is so rare theres fewer than onepart per billion in our Earths crust But were not done yetIridium and osmium are both in the platinum familyAnd if you take a look at platinum its much more common than both iridium and osmiumbut theres something neat that I think we should considerStable isotopes And its one of the isotopes of platinum thatwill finish our story Platinum190Its a stable isotope with halflife of over billion years thats nonreactiveIts fits all our criteria A ring made of the scarcest naturallyoccurring stable nonreactive thing So hey it would be an awesome ringNow youre probably wondering Michael why did you experiment with vanadium sulphurgold and cerium Well heres whats interestingTake a look at the periodic table and theres symbolsTada Vsauce And as always thanks for

How High Can We Build?,2012-06-03T18:04:34Z,10.116666666666667,28725486,416170,Hey Vsauce Michael here And when the pyramidsof Giza were built the tallest was 147 meters tall making them the tallest things humanshad ever built And they remained that way for nearly 4000 years It wasnt even untilthe 1300s that we finally got around to making something taller a cathedral in EnglandSo does that mean that the Great Pyramids of Giza are the Best tallest structures of all time Well to find out more all aboard the BOAT So what is a building Well technicallya building is a structure in which at least 50 of its height comes from floor plateswhere people can live work chill out it has to be habitable Any less than that andits not a building its a tower After the Lincoln Cathedral finally surpassed the heightof the pyramids a number of churches continued to be built that kept breaking and settingnew records The next longterm record holder was the Eiffel TowerIt was the tallest thing ever in history that we had built for about 40 years in arow It was finally surpassed by the Chrysler Building in New York a personal favoritewhich was then quickly bested by the Empire State Building Now the Empire State Buildingis interesting in that it was the first structure ever built by man that was so tall were youto jump off the top of it you would actually reach terminal velocity before you hit thebottom It was the first structure wed ever built that was so tall rather than just continuingto accelerate as you fell you would actually stop accelerating because you would reachthe fastest possible speed your limp body can fall at In the mid 1950s somethingweird started to happen Humans started to build radio and TV towers These things couldbe way taller than the buildings that wed made previously that had to be habitableAnd so ever since the Empire State Building had its record broken by a TV tower all theseother famously tall buildings the Petronas Towers Tapei 101 the World Trade Centerthe Willis Tower  formerly Sears Tower  none of them have ever within their existenceactually held the title for being the tallest thing weve ever built There was alwaysa radio or TV tower somewhere that was taller Up until quite recently and for quite a whilethe record for the tallest thing ever built by humans went to the Warsaw radio mast inPoland Its visually incredibly striking because there arent any other sky scrapersaround it Its all alone being very tall Well that was until 1991 where some workersexchanging guywires made a mistake and the whole thing started to bend and then snappedin the middle Theres no video of the event happening but it would have been similarto this collapse though much much taller After the Warsaw radio mast collapsed theKVLYTV mast in North Dakota became the tallest still standing structure built by man Butrecently buildings have made a comeback And to check that out were going to haveto travel to the Middle East This is the first time Ive ever touched the Nile Tadaaa Ok so that was me dipping my waterproof camera into the Nile If you were to take the entire length of the Nile River and standit up on its edge perpendicular to the Earth it would reach into outer space about thisfar which is pretty impressive But where does the space shuttle orbit And where doesthe International Space Station orbit This far away This far away Maybe this far awayActually if this pink inflatable Horrible Bosses ball was the Earth the space shuttlewould orbit about right there Its incredible but its possible because the shuttle andthe International Space Station travel so quickly They travel so quickly around theEarth that instead of seeing one sunrise and sunset every 24 hours they see 16But dont be jealous You can easily see more than one sunrise andor sunset in a day bytaking advantage of tall structures So lets take a look at the tallest structure thecurrent record holder for the tallest thing humans have ever built the Burj Khalifa inDubai The height of this building blows my mind You can literally watch the sunset fromthe base of the building and then take a superfast elevator alltheway up to thetop and watch the same sun set again In fact the differencein timing between sunset at the base and the top is so significant the Dubai Islamic Affairsdepartment actually had to make a ruling about when you can start and break your fast duringRamadan inside the building People above floor 80 or higher have to actually wait tostart eating 23 minutes after the people at the base because the sun hasnt yet setfor those at the top But before you head to Dubai to watch the sun rise or set twicein a day keep in mind that the only height you actually need to see two sunrises or sunsetsis the height of your own body Try this the next time youre at a beachWatch the sun rise or set over the water Water is important because it wonthave the terrain and hill issues that land does Now lets say youre watching a sunsetBegin by laying on your stomach Watch the sun set and as soon as the very last little bitof the sun goes below the horizon quickly pop up into a standing position and voiláyoull see the suns back  part of its back  and it will set another time If you take a stopwatch and record the timebetween the first setting and the second setting that you witness and measure the heightof your eyes when youre laying down and when youre standing you can use those numbersto calculate the radius of the Earth XKCD took this a little bit further by proposingthe Double Sunset Date Take your date out to the beach in a cherry picker and sureenough it was calculated given the speed of a cherry picker all you have to do is moveabout 6 feet up and you can watch a beautiful sunset all over again To put things in perspective the Burj Khalifais nowhere near as tall as Mount Everest But the tallest structure that we could potentiallybuild wouldnt be as tall as Mount Everest it would be way way taller Like into spacetaller Of course the problem with building things that are really tall is that they getheavier and heavier and have to support their own weight But only up to a point If a structure was so tall that it wound upat the altitude of a geostationary orbit it would start to feel a new force not justa gravitational force downward but all of the sudden this new centrifugal force up and outward And so a building that tall could be stablethrough tension And more than 35000 km highThis kind if structure is known as a Space Elevator Unfortunately there arent any materialsknown to science today that are strong enough to make building something that large feasableWith the exception maybe of Carbon Nanotubes or BoronNitrate Nanotubes Of course ifwe went to a smaller celestial body like the Moon we could build one today out ofstuff like Kevlar There are a lot of different things that wehave to be wary of when we build a space elevator For instance how do we dodge space debrisOne solution is to attach the Earth side of the cable to a boat in the ocean that canmaneuver around and move the elevator away from dangerous obstacles Another interesting point is that the tallerthe cable the faster the far end of it will be traveling In fact if the cable is morethan 50000 km long its far end will be travelling near escape velocity and simply walking outsidecould take you to the Moon But why build a space elevator Well because it would beawesome But also for better reasons too For instance right now in order to senda pound of material into orbit it costs about 11000 dollars But with a space elevatorwe could send the same amount of material into orbit for only about 100 bucks Thatdifference is so significant that Philip Ragan has said that the first country to deploya space elevator will have a 95 cost advantage and will possibly be able to control all spacerelated activities Alright so here you see in the mirror Alexplaying guitar while she holds a camera in her mouth and

Why Is Yawning Contagious?,2012-05-12T19:10:36Z,5.75,4692990,74078,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd today were going to talk about yawning Why do we yawn and why is yawning contagious How come when I see someone yawn or eventhink about it it makes me kinda of want to yawnFirst things first definitions When you yawn you inhale air and stretch your ear drumsThats why your ears pop when you yawn Now if you yawn and at the same timestretch your whole body that is called pandiculationA common misconception about yawning is that people yawnwhen they need more air more oxygenBut studies have shown that no matter how much oxygen is in the air around a personthey wont yawn more or less frequently And when people exerciseand their bodies do in fact need more oxygen they dont yawn more often Instead research has shown that ourfirst answer most likely lies in being coolWhen you are exhausted tired deep brain temperatures increase but your brain islike a computer  it operates best at a very specific temperatureAnd so yawning bringing all this outside air in throughyour ears and your mouth cools your facial blood and actuallyhelps cool down your brainThis phenomenon is particularly easy to observe when parakeets yawn Researchers havefound that parakeets only yawn within a very specific range of temperatures Too cold outside and yawning will coolthe brain too much Too hot and yawning will actually warmit up Parakeets are perfect test subjects for this effect because they yawn just like you and meexcept they dont exhibit contagious yawnIf you show a person a video of other people yawning its likely that the personwatching will yawn his or herself unless you put an ice pack on their forehead keeping their brain cooler Seriously The University of Albany hasfound that people contagiously yawn less frequently when they haveice packs on their head which means that yawning to cool your brain isnt just for the birdsStudies have shown that yawning also increases blood pressure stretches facial muscles and increases focus When you panticulate you stretch all of your muscles making them betterready to be used at any momentSo when it comes to a herd of prey animals contagious yawning make sensebecause a herd that yawns together stays alert together Under this theory yawning is advantageously contagious because that firstanimal to yawn acts as a sort of reminder to the restof the herd to keep themselves ready and alert But of course when we say that yawning is contagious we dont mean like a diseaseInstead its a bit more closely related to empathy Sympathy is when you areconcerned for others where you wish someone was better offEmpathy is the ability to recognize and share the emotions that other people feel Emotional contagion is when the emotions of people around youinfluence the way you feel without you even having to separateyourselves from them like when being around happy people lifts your spirits or how anger and fear can lead to mob mentalityNow children with autism who exhibitimpaired social interaction and communication yawn less frequently than other children when viewing videos of people yawningSo is yawning an emotional contagion or is it about empathyWell last year the University of Pisa found that yawn contagiousness is greatest with family and then friends and then acquaintances and lastly strangers And a study at Leeds University broughtin participants to take a test that measured how empathetic they wereBut before the test began amongst them was one personwho worked for the researchers and this person yawnedevery minute for 10 minutes Interestingly the people who wound upscoring the highest on the empathy test were also the oneswho contagiously yawned along the mostLets talk more about animal yawning What fascinates me so much is thatanimals across many species all yawn but they do so for different reasons Animals like guinea pigs and some monkeys yawn to intimidate and show their sharp scary teeth Some penguins yawn to attract mates and when snakes yawn it seems to be about realigning theirjaws and opening their tracheas to breathe better after a big bodydisfiguring mealFish yawn more frequently when water oxygen levels are low or water heat levels are high So when you yawn youreparticipating in the behavior shared across all kinds of animals but most likely youre yawning forpurposes unique to your species  us humans Whats really cool is that yawning is most likely an ancient signaltelling the rest of us humans lets do this lets survive And as always thanks for watching,128.8695652173913,separateyourselves,0.0,1.0,jGIbUK4nw00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGIbUK4nw00

Why Are We Ticklish? Why do We Laugh?,2012-04-22T10:13:52Z,3.9166666666666665,3810405,73168,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd today were going to talk about humor comedyWhat makes something funny and when somethings funny why do we laugh Whats the purpose of laughing and whydo we laugh when were tickled Well people study thisTheyre called gelotologists and we dont have all the answers yetbut what we do know is that you are thirty times more likely to laugh if there are other people around We also know that babies laugh beforethey learn a language and that babies born blind and deaf will laugh There are thousands of languageshundreds of thousands of dialects but yet we all laugh in much the same wayOur brains are constantly looking for patterns  ways of understanding the world andpredicting whats next Its to our evolutionary advantage And so whensomething begins in a way that we expect and then all of a sudden changes andsurprises or delights us we often react with laughterbecause we have just learned somethingWeve learned a new logical orderThis theory posits that things are funny because theres an incongruitybetween what we expected and what happenedWhether its a dog dressed like a human or a clever use of word play In other words comedy is about learning But once youve learned the new logicalorder of the joke well it ceases to be funnywhich is why jokes are funny the first time but not every other time after thatTake a look at this percentage signAlright so you know what a percent sign is But besides the percent theres also a permil and permyriad symbolBut thats not funny because even though it might benew information to you it still falls right in line with the logic of thepercent symbol But what Demetri Martin shows us with just one more lineyou can make it look like a man cheering after taking a dump well that surprises us But we dont only laugh when somethings funny What about tickling How does that make any sense Most of us dont like being tickled but when tickled we cant help but smile and laughWell a possible explanation is that tickling helps teach children at a young ageproper defensive behaviors Is it a coincidence that themost ticklish areas are also the most vulnerableand the ones that we instinctively cover when startled Also because being tickledmakes the person laugh it may encourage others to tickle themteaching them these defensive skillsTickling may even play a role before you are bornIn order to avoid being tickled a baby gets into a better position to be delivered Now physically laughing involves the epiglottis  a little flap thing thatprotects the trachea whenever we swallow so that food and waterdoesnt go down into our lungs I know it doesnt look very funny but this is where the laugh happensThe epiglottis constricts the larynx and we get the LOLInterestingly the epiglottis actually has taste budson it which means that anatomically speaking comedy truly is a matter of taste Get out of my house And as always thanks for watching,127.40425531914894,incongruitybetween,0.0,1.0,ddV6jyDeCKA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddV6jyDeCKA
8 Surprising Facts,2012-04-17T15:58:01Z,3.2666666666666666,5143988,62595,Hey Vsauce Michael hereComing to you from the Barbican in London Its beautiful its like living inside theRegenstein Library Thats a concrete jokeBut Ive put together a leanback of videos all around YouTube that I really likethat I host as a playlist You can start it by clicking the link at thetop of this videos description Its best if youre on a computer or a laptopsomething like that But to make it worth your time in this videoIm going to share some facts I learned this week that were quite surprising and coolFor instance being attractive might actually mean that you are better if you play American football When females were asked to rank the hotnessof male American football players there was a quite surprising correlationThe players that the females ranked as being hotter also tended to be the players withthe highest passing ratings PassingNot like passing in a car with a with a footballBut passing in a car brings up the question of gas pricesWhen gas prices go up fewer people drive and when fewer people are driving there are fewer accidents Its actually quite mathematicalIt has been shown that for every 10 increase in the cost of gasthe number of car accidents goes down by 23 Fewer accidents means fewer deathsAnd heres a fact about death More people have died inside the Halo gamesthan have ever died in real life on Earth throughout the entire history of humans being around Killing somebody in real life makes you a murderer But the definitions of terms like that are very specific For instance if you kill four or more peopleat one time youre technically considered by the FBI a mass murdererAnd if you kill two or more people sometimes three or more people with a time gap in betweenthose events  a cooling down period you are technically a serial killer Based on the number of unsolved murders criminologists estimate that in the United States at anygiven time there are about 100 serial killers who have yet to be caught walking amongst us So keep your eyes peeled or blink if you want to I mean the average person blinks 15 times a minuteBut when you watch television or YouTube videos you blink even less frequently  only about75 times a minute So why blink more often than you have toGo ahead and click the link at the top of the description to play the Vsauce LeanbackIts sure to keep your eyes open because its full of videos around the topic of surpriseIll see you over there be sure to subscribe to Vsauce for more videos And as always thanks for watching,135.3061224489796,laptopsomething,0.0,-1.0,I9LbG3Y0_9M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9LbG3Y0_9M

How Much Is A Bird in The Hand Worth?,2012-03-28T22:54:31Z,5.933333333333334,2509115,49746,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd as they say a bird in the hand is worth two in the bushWhat it means is that its better to have a certain advantage than to have nothing except the possibility of a greater oneBut two birds in the bush Who calculated thatWhat really is the value of a bird in the handWell according to Julian Baggini a bird in the hand is technically worth 248 birds in the bush He calculated that number by looking at observations from studies of what psychologists call loss aversion Loss aversion is a namegiven to the tendency we humans have to more strongly prefer to avoid losingsomething we have than to gain something that we dont In general its been shown that if someone loses a hundred dollars they lose more satisfaction than someone who receives a hundred dollars acquires Researchers have been able to get moregranular with loss aversion In one study they gave half of theparticipants something nice like a fancy mug and the other half they gave nothingThen they asked the peoplewith mugs to come up with a value for the mug were they to sell it andnever have it again They also asked the people who never gota mug how much they would be willing to pay to have a mugNow the people who would never had one estimated that the value of the muhwould only be about 287 But those who did have the mug and knew thatthey would never have it again if they sold it estimated its value to be abouttwoandahalf times larger around 7 dollarsSo according to the evidence in a general sense having is actually slightly more than twice as good as not havingBut why just cover that aphorism Lets talk about some other literaryterms because our language can do some pretty funny things and those things it does have specificnames Lets begin with the blind date murdererA meme people create that starts off all scaryand frightening but then turns out to actually be niceand cuddling For instance Im going to rip off your facebookstatus you are so funny Im gonna cut you out some coupons forthat pizza place you like If you struggle itll only make it worseaccording to this fascinating article Im sending you about quicksand Many other memes use a similar structureand the reason its funny is that its an example of what is knownas paraprosdokian A paraprosdokian is a sentence orphrase you can use that begins one wayleading people to think a certain thing but then in the second half completelyreverses or in some way changes that initial opinionI will eat your baby carrots if you dont want themSyntactic ambiguity is when you cant figure out exactlywhat a sentence means because the order of the words doesnthelp It frequently occurs in newspaper headlinesFor instance Police Help Dog Bite VictimWell did the police help a person whod been bit by a dog or did thepolice help a dog bite a victimFree Hat Are you giving away hats for free or are you trying to get a guy named Hat out of jail Lexical ambiguity in my opinionis often more fun This happens when a word has multiplemeanings and figuring out which one is being used in a sentence is a challenge The word buffalo can meana number of different things Its the name of an animal the name of acity and it can also be a verb which means to bully or confuse or baffle as in Hm this video buffalos meI tweeted about this a few months ago Because buffalo has those three meanings it is possible to make it completely sensical and correct legitimate sentence using only the word buffaloBuffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo You have to think about it for a long timefor it to make sense but what its really saying is that bisonfrom the City of Buffalo that bison from the City of Buffalo bully also happened to bully other bison fromthe City of Buffalo Tongue twistersAll I have to say here is that the she inside she sells seashells by theseashore is an actual she not just some random girlShe most likely refers to Marry Anning a British paleontologist whocollected fossils from beaches nearby where she lived her entire life and discovered the very first Ichthyosaurs skeleton when she was only 12 years oldNow its time for my favorite literary term tmesis This word is great because youget to spell it with the T and then an M and no vowel in betweenTmesis is a figure of speech when you stick a word inside anotherword For instance why say absolutelywhen you could say absofreakinlutely And why sayyoure welcomewhen you could say youre weldiddlyelcome And of course legend wait for it daryFinally a spoonerism is a specific type of verbal mistake where you switch the first two lettersof two words Many of us do this occasionally but itsnamed after William Archibald Spooner a reverend who did this a lotFor instance instead of saying that the Lord is aloving Shepherd he would tell everybody that the Lord is a shoving leopardHe would get his merds wixed up One of my favorite howevercomes from Sarah Palin When you spoonarise her nameshe becomes Parah Salin And as always wanks for thatching,148.31460674157302,completelyreverses,0.0,1.0,hup_8uDXJx8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hup_8uDXJx8
Water Is Amazing -- World Water Day!,2012-03-23T00:18:58Z,5.916666666666667,2183101,33071,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd today were going to talk about water Because today is World Water DayA day about raising awareness of the fact that even though here on Earth there isenough clean safe drinking water for everybody to have enough they dontIn fact a billion of them dont But it doesnt have to be that wayNow first I wanna cover how water is not just vital and amazing but to this day continuesto surprise us For instance the Mpemba effectThe effect has been observed many many many times but has never been explainedIn fact it is so famously anticommon sense whenever people throughout history have observedit theyve tended to think that they just did something wrongWhich is why even though Aristotle himself wrote about it it wasnt until the 20th centurythat it got its name Simply put the Mpemba effect is the observationthat under the right circumstances a glass of boiling hot water inside a freezer canturn to ice more quickly than a glass of cold waterIt doesnt make a lot of sense but it can happenA few possible causes have been thrown out For instance if you heat up or boil wateryou remove some of the dissolved gas And having less stuff dissolved in it maybe what makes hot water easier to freeze Its the opposite of why we throw down saltduring wintery weather The salt dissolves into the water puttingmore stuff in it making it more difficult to freezeBut does that account for the entire effect Well some other possible explanations involveconvection currents A glass of warm water will contain more cyclingconvection currents meaning that the top of that glass of water is warmerAnd a glass of warm water will tend to freeze from the sides in whereas the glass of coldwater will tend to freeze all across the top downBut once that top layer is frozen it acts as an insulator so all the water below itfreezes more slowly The point is that we still do not have a completeexplanation of the effect Part of the problem is how difficult it isto control every single variable Should we be using equal masses of water orequal volumes Should they be in the same freezer or in separatefreezers And what about evaporationThe warm water will be evaporating faster and evaporations into thermosis its losingheat more quickly than the cold water Its toughBut heres what we do know Earth has a lot of water70 of Earths surface is covered in it And interestingly enough excluding fatthe human body is about 70 water But when you were born you were a big oldsack of water Thats rightA new baby is 78 water Now that number drops to 65 by the timethat baby is 1 year old And itll drop even further to about 60 whenyoure an adult man Adult women are only about 55 waterThis is because womens physiology on average contains more fat which doesnt hold as muchwater as lean tissue In fact fat people regardless of gendercontain less water than thin people Earth has a lot of water but its almost all salty 965 of the water on Earth is in the oceansAnother 34 of Earths water can be found in other large bodies of water or frozen insideglaciers or ice caps But you me all the other animals we seeother manufactured products They all contain waterAbout 00003 of Earths total water And all of the storms and clouds and rainand thunderstorms happening contain only about 00001 of all the water Earth hasThats a lot of water but despite that fact almost a billion people on Earth dont haveaccess to potable water Potable comes from the Latin for to drinkwhich means clean safe water free from disease and contaminationThe number of people on Earth who do not have sustainable access to potable water is equivalentto the number of people living inside the United StatesExcept multiplied by three And every year 35 million people die becauseof nonpotable waterrelated diseases Thats equivalent to the entire populationof Los Angeles So every year Earth our planet looses anentire city of Los Angeles because people dont have access to clean waterSo today on World Water Day its worth talking about organisations that are making a differencebecause things dont have to be the way that they areOrganisations like Waterorg help local communities build sustainable clean water solutions thatthe community itself will own Now they gave me a chance to go out to Indiato see this in action along with WheezyWaiter and Strawburry17 Unfortunately I wasnt able to go but those other two people were and theyve got videosover on their channels about their experiences So go check those out and if you wanna learnmore got waterorgvsauce to see how you can help And as always thanks for watching,134.19718309859155,completeexplanation,0.0,1.0,9m3dQC6IfwY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m3dQC6IfwY

Travel INSIDE a Black Hole,2012-03-07T04:54:38Z,10.75,32916795,577435,Hey Vsauce Michael here And today we aregoing to go inside a black hole Its not going to be comfortable but it will be prettyfun Now first things first mathematically speaking anything could become a black holeif you were to compress it into a small enough space Thats right you me this camera everything in the unvierse has what is known as a Schwarzschild radius A tiny tiny amountof space that were you to collapse the entire mass of the object into its density wouldbe so great that its gravitational pull would be so great that not even light could escapefrom it You would have a black hole If you were to compress Mount Everest intosomething smaller than a nanometer you would have a black hole And if you were to compressthe entire Earth down to the size of a peanut you would have a black hole But fortunately for us there is no knownway to compress Everest or Earth in that fashion But a star many many many times largerthan our own Sun has a much larger Schwartzchild radius and when it runs out of fuel and canno longer keep itself hot enough it collapses to a single infinitesimallysmall point knownas a singularity Its density will be infinite and so itsgravitational pull will be so strong that nothing can escape not even light But enough about ways black holes form letsjump into one First question what would it look like from the outside Well we knowthat gravitational fields bend space and time Stars behind our Sun will actually appearto be in slightly different locations from Earth because the Suns gravitational fieldbends the light coming from those stars When it comes to the gravitational fieldsof larger objects like entire galaxies or for that matter a black hole the effectis even nuttier Light coming from objects behind them is significantly distortedproducing smears and smudges As seen from Earth the blue galaxy behindthis red galaxy is completely distorted like a fun house mirror So rather than appearingas it really should it looks to us like a ring  a smudge all the way around the red galaxy This is known as gravitational lensingNow take a look at this simulation of a black hole with a galaxy millions of lightyearsbehind it The galaxys really not in danger of the black holes suck but the lightcoming off of that galaxy certainly is Watch as the galaxy passes behind the black holeand its light is contorted twisted and distorted Now heres a really fun demonstration What if the Earth were to orbit around a blackhole Looking from the outside the Earth would look normal at first but as soon asit passed behind the black hole the black holes gravitational field would warp thelight reflecting off the Earth producing this For the sake of simplicity lets jump intoa simple black hole one that doesnt have a charge and isnt moving And also isntalready sucking up a bunch of matter So its just there on its own As we approach the distortion of the skygrows greater and greater A larger and larger portion of our field of view looking forwardinto the black hole will be filled with darkness At this point where half of our field ofview has been swallowed up in darkness we have reached the Photon Sphere At this point light is not going to necessarilyget sucked into the black hole but it doesnt necessarily leave it either Instead at thismagical point in space light photons can actually orbit the black hole If you were to stop here for a moment andlook to the side you could theoretically see the back of your own head because lightreflecting off the back of your head would travel all the way around the sphere of theblack hole right back to your face A gravitational field not only warps spaceit also warps time Now for most intensive purposes here on Earth we never have to worryabout that But near a black hole gravity would be so strong that an observer standingwatching you jump into the hole would see something quite strange They wouldnt seeyou get sucked quickly into the hole Instead they would see your approach become slowerand slower and slower until you reached a point known as the eventhorizon This is a point in space where once crossedtheres no going back It is at that point that light can no longer escape And soto a person watching you fall into the hole that would be where your journey ended Youwould seem almost frozen in space the light coming off your body becoming increasinglyredshifted until you simply faded into nothingness They would never see you cross the eventhorizon But for you of course everything would seemfine and dandy You would continue pass that horizon to your now inevitable deathAs you continue to approach the black holes singularity your view of the entire universewould get compressed into a smaller and smaller point in space behind you If the black hole were jumping into was largeenough things actually might be quite comfortable at that event horizon Well know that werenever going to escape and that our lives are pretty much over but it might take us hoursto actually reach a point where things started to hurt Why would they hurt Well the closer you getto the singularity the more significant the difference in gravitational pull is acrossspace And so parts of me that are closer to the singularity would be pulled more stronglythan parts that were facing away and my entire body would be stretched toward the singularityThe effect would be so incredible scientists dont usually call it stretching they callit Spaghettification Once you reach this point you would be deadYour molecules would be violently ripped and stretched apart and when they got to thesingularity well we dont really know what would happen Perhaps they would completelydisappear in violation of all the laws of physics or maybe they would reappear elsewherein the universe It is believed that a moving or spinning black hole might actually createwhat is known as a wormhole a way of transitioning across space faster than light Not in anyway that violates the laws of science but in a way that takes advantage of the universesdimensions For instance if I wanted to get from thispoint to this point Id have to travel the distance But theoretically a wormhole woulddo something really crazy For instance this Now the two points are right next to eachother and I can travel between them almost instantaneously But again this is all theoretical Luckilywe do have a possible way of analyzing black holes right here on Earth Enter the Dumbhole Just as a black hole does not permit lightto escape a Dumbhole is an acoustic black hole It wont allow sound to escape It doesnthave to be nearly as powerful and scientists have been able to create Dumbholes in laboratoriesusing special fluids traveling at the speed of sound A lot of progress still needs to be made inthe world of acoustic black holes but we may be able to learn an amazing amount ofinformation about how black holes work by looking at how sound is treated in a Dumbhole Now heres another good question What wouldit look like to travel at the speed of light say toward the Sun Well surprisingly youwouldnt just see the Sun immediately rush up toward you No no no In fact initiallyit would look almost as if the Sun were receding away from you Why Because your field ofview would vastly increase in size You would be able to see stuff almost behind you And heres why As you sit there not moving yet lookingat the Sun theres light coming from stuff behind you But if you travel the speed oflight you will actually reach that light coming from things behind you As you reachedlight speed your field of view would expand like this concentrating the stuff in themiddle But where are you in the universe Or heresa better question Where is the center of the universe Well this might sound crazybut its everywhere This is known as the Cosmological Principle No matter whereyou are in the universe everything else will seem to be moving away from you expandingat the same rate The universe is expanding but not like aballoon getting bigger with all the people inside it Instead its as if we are thesurface of a balloon If you were to put a bunch of dots on a balloon and then blow itup all the dots would move away from each other at the same rate And on the surfaceof the balloon there is no center Take a look at these two layers They areexactly similar except the top layer represents a 5 expansion of the bottom layer Lets say that you live on one of these dotsand you want to measure where everything is moving away from Well watch what happenswhen I line up a dot in the past and the present Boom It looks like the center of the expansionI can do this with any dot As soon as I choose a dot to be the frame of reference it immediatelybecomes the center of the expansion So while dying in a black hole would be lonelyand scary and morbid when you look up into the sky think instead about this No matterwhere you are or who you are or what your friends or your parents you reallyscientifically are the center of the universe Finally what if our universe was a googolplexmeters across It is nowhere near that large But if it was it would be so voluminousthat statistically it would be nearly impossible for there not to be an exact copy of you somewhereelse out there in the universe To see why I highly suggest that you

EPIC LEAPS.,2012-02-29T05:24:10Z,8.133333333333333,2736452,52603,Hey Vsauce Michael here and today in honor of Leap Day I would like totalk about leaps Whats the largest leap a livingthing could possibly take And how does the fact that life can leap possibly give us evidence that you me and all of us are actually aliens Well in 1903 the Wright Brothers became the first humans to fly in an airplane and then a mere 66 years later we were already landing on the moon Neil Armstrongs giant leap for mankind may have been a small step for him but lets put these two events in perspective The Wright Brothers original flight was so brief and low it couldve completely occurred inside the external tank of the space shuttle What Im getting at here is that going from the very first airplane to us landing on the moon only took 66 years But to get from the invention of the motorcycle to the very first successful backflip on a motorcycle didnt take 66 years No it took nearly 120 The first successful backflip done on a full sized motorcycle didnt happen until the year 2000 and it was accomplished by Kerry Hart Now since then double backflips and eventriple backflips have been done on motorcycles But according to calculations done byextreme sport physics no matter how much better riders get with the current power motorcycles have you will never be able to do any more thanfour back flips in one jump Extreme sports in general are excellentfor demonstrating physics— for instance your center of mass Your center of mass is a point in space where your mass is concentrated Its where your weight as caused by gravity acts from Now humans have a surprisingly highcenter of gravity which makes it possible formagicians to do tricks like this one The concept of a center of mass also explains why a skateboarder canincrease his or her speed on an incline just by changing howtall theyre standing Its also the reason you can pump your legs to swing higher in a swing What you accomplish by pumping your legs on a swing is an elevation of your center of mass above where your body actually is Now because gravity acts at that point youre going to swing back down as if you were higher up than you actually were So you gain more and more acceleration each time Geometrically speaking the center of the lower 48 states is near Lebanon Kansas But this is where things get heartwarming If you were to cut out the lower 48 states and then take that shape and figure out how to balance it perfectly you would find that the center of mass for the United States is a town in Nebraska called Friend Back to leaps heres a question you may have asked yourself while watching certain movies could a snow boarder escape an oncoming avalanche Well in 2007 Popular Science Magazine said no But technically you could Extreme sports physics points out thatGalileo showed that when friction and drag are low gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate So while its possible it wouldntnecessarily be safe But when are extreme sports ever safe If you want to get really unsafelets go back to Joseph Kittinger Ive covered this guy in lean backs in the past Hes the guy who back in 1960 as partof a government experiment jumped off of a weather balloon102000 feet above earth so high up that you can see the back of space But within the next few years Red Bull may have something hidden up their sleeve Its rumored that Kittinger himselfmay be advising an upcoming project with Felix Bongardner where Felix will dive not from 102000 feet up but 120000 feet up The difference here is that Felix will be jumping to earth actually from what we consider space and during his fall he will literally break the sound barrier His body will travel faster than sound He will become the first humanto break the sound barrier with their body Earths gravity loves to pull things down towards it But the gravity we experience here on thesurface is just one gravity one g—its what causes us to weight what we weigh But when we accelerate we experience more than 1g When the world record for the mostair achieved on a snow board occurred the snowboarder himselfexperienced four to five gs at the base of the ramp Meaning that momentarily his legs eachhad to support 700 pounds To put this in perspective astronauts aboard the space shuttle experience a peak of only 3gs More than 5gs experienced for an extended period of time can easily be lethal Enter the euthanasia coaster Its a roller coaster designedto kill the people who ride it The first drop accelerates you to more than200 miles an hour And these loops are built to provide a constant10 g experience for one full minute Its estimated that no human being could even survive past the firsttwo loops Why Because 10 gs exerted that way would pull blood away from your brainstarving it of oxygen resulting in brain death And thats just 10 gs If you were to ride on a bullet you would experience a peak g force of 190000 That means that your body would weigh190000 times more than it does stationary on earth But heres where things get muddy Japanese researchers have found bacteria that not only survive but thrive in an ultra centerfuge exerting not 190000 gs but more than 400000 The implications here are mind blowing We already know that some single celled lifeforms can survive in extreme conditions Just this morning I was readingone of Bill Brysons books about how we have actually found dormantbut viable bacteria trapped inside cameras left for years on the moon If simple life forms can also surviveincredible gforces that means that the entire earth was blownup by an asteroid life as we know it might not be over There may be simple life forms that could survive dormant traveling through space only to land on other planetsbillions of years in the future In fact whos to say that a similar process isnt what brought life here to earth It sounds crazy but the entire concept has a name Panspermia Lets keep things grounded and stick to earth Specifically extreme sports I had all these leap thoughts lately becauseIve been working with really cool extreme sport channels— new ones—here on YouTube including Ride with Tony Hawk Ally Sports and Network A If you like extreme sports you should definitely check these out theyve even got special messagesjust for you So have fun cherish the leap day and as always thanks for watching,137.7049180327869,wouldntnecessarily,0.0,1.0,69HCbzffHAc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69HCbzffHAc

What is Cool?,2012-02-17T21:38:01Z,5.5,4167199,77753,Hey Vsauce Michael here and a couple of weeks ago Vices new channel Noisey blind folded me the Gregory Brothers about 200 other people and then bused us to a hidden skrillex show It was cool but what is cool I mean what does it mean to be cool Cool is a judgement of taste People who are cool are with it They exhibit a style people want to emulatetheyre fashionable But being cool isnt just about confidence or being above the situation In fact what is considered cool changesall the time Heres a fantastic illustration charting by time and location what was generally considered cool To truly get the origin of what we today mean by cool were going to have to go back to West Africain the 15th Century The Yoruba language has a great word itutu It means physical beauty but also being calm and detached from your circumstances almost unnaturally so in a superhuman kind of way And a similar more specific term comes from the Italian concept of sprezzatura This was a way of behaving favored by the wealthy upper class in 15th Century Italy And to exhibit this behavior you wanted to act nonchalant evenif doing so would take a lot of work You would hide your desires and emotions behind ironic detachment But where can you see sprezzatura Well how about here—the Mona Lisa She doesnt laughShes exercising restraint It almost feels like shes looking down on you smugly Now to make this more clear lets take a look at a recent discovery a painting that used to be thought of as a copy of the Mona Lisa made years and years later Except recent restoration has shown that the very same mistakes and corrections that DaVinci made on the originalwere also done on this painting leading restorers to believe that this painting was made side by side with the actual Mona Lisa Look at her expression Its even more clear that shes looking at you likeHuh really You think youre cool  Okay Related is the Italian concept of omerta This is keeping your cool and nottelling the authorities anything about anybody Its the type of attitude you see in movies likeGoodfellas or The Godfather But our modern definition of cool may most directly come from slaves and prisoners People in those positions are subjected to authority in a very direct way and any kind of rebellion against authority or fighting against it is most certainly going to be answered with nothing but punishment and very little chance of success And so instead an attitude ofironic detachment is taken on which allows you to distance yourself from that authority to be away from it against it without actively confronting it and getting in trouble Now later on in the 1940s the actual word cool began to stick to this attitude it came out of the smoke filled nightclubs where jazz beatnik and bohemian culture thrived The only way to freshen up that smoke filled air was to open windows and let the cool night air in Saxophonist Lester Young is credited with making this connection and popularizing the use of the word cool even cooler is the fact that Lester also popularized the use of the word bread to mean money Well look at that the sun has come out Thats cool It also means that its agood time to talk about the brain Laurence Steinberg points out that there are systems in the brain that mature as we get older The first is the socioemotional network and this deal is social and emotional inputs Second is the cognitive control network This deals with regulating behaviorand making ultimate decisions But these two networks do not mature at the same rate In fact theres an awkward periodin puberty and adolescence where the social emotional network in our brain is more active and so whether or not people think you are cool matters more to you than is reasonable So in a way you could say that the less worried you are with being cool the more developed your brain is Instead focus on vocabulary The only thing that doesnt change the onlycoolness that doesnt fade is cool—the word Over the years we have used allkinds of other words to mean cool but the one that has never changedthe one that has always been cool to use is cool And thats cool  Go check out that skrillex concert footage Noisey is the channel that uploaded that new MIA video as well as MIAs responses to YouTube comments And according to this guy fat peopleshouldnt be making music All I know is as always thanks for watching,142.36363636363637,likeGoodfellas,0.0,1.0,Af3ZG47oT7I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af3ZG47oT7I

YOU LIVE IN THE PAST,2012-02-06T03:25:12Z,7.183333333333334,7785589,158109,Hey Vsauce Michael here and todaywe are going to be talking about the past But not like history—in fact—we willbe talking about what we call now This very newest moment in timeand the fact that we can never really be aware of or livein what we call now because it takes time for our brain to process the information aboutwhats happening now and it takes time for that informationto get from the rest of our body to our brain In fact the taller you are the further back from now the furtherback from the past you live But more importantly why do we call emotional relationshipbased movies targeted at femaleschick flicks Well for the answers to these questions were going to start with theflash lag effect David Eagleman has done some amazingresearch on this effect Its what occurs when a participant looksat a ring moving around in a circle A light is flashing exactly in the middleof the ring This is exactly what the photons landingon their retinas represent But when asked what they saw participantsresponded they saw this Now for the longest time it washypothesized that people said this because our brains guess ahead Our brain assumed that the ringwould continue doing what it had been doing and figured it would be safer to go aheadand say that the ring was already a bit ahead of the light But Eagleman wanted to know whatwould happen if when that flash of light occurred inthe middle of the ring the ring all of a sudden reversed direction and spun around the other way If our brains really are guessing ahead participants should still say that they saw this because the brain figured that the ringwould be there and were surprised when it went the other direction But instead participantssaid that they saw this Now how could they have seen thisif they had no way of knowing that the ring was going to reverse directionWere their brains clairvoyant Can our brains see into the future As it turns out no Whats really happening here is thatour eyeballs are receiving an image— an image of a flash of lightinside a ring But then our brains wait a little bit to make sure that we have the full story And as the ring begins to reverse direction that new information is incorporatedinto what we actually sense and we become aware of the wrongversion of now By doing more studies withrings traveling at different speeds Eagleman was able to determine that what we are aware of as now what our brain tells us is happening actually happened 80 millisecondsin the past Now 80 milliseconds is not a lot of time but its a little scary to think thatour brain has no physical way of knowing being aware ofor even living anywhere but slightly in the past Nerve impulses travel through our body at a top speed of around 250 miles per hour But now look at Bill Warneron a motorcycle Hes going really fast In fact hes going 278 miles per hour which means that this guy on a motorcycle is traveling faster than my braincan even figure out what now is Keep in mind that 250 miles per houris the top speed for neural impulses within our body If I tap my nose and tap my toes at the exact same time it feels instantaneous even though there is no physical waythat the brain could actually be receiving that because when I tap my nosethe message goes right into my brain But when I tap my toes the messagehas to travel across the entire length of my body The brain waits momentarily to make sure that theres nothing else going on or coming in and then corroborates all that information and we become aware that the taps wereindeed instantaneous But we dont become aware of that tapuntil the brain is sure which means that the taller you are the longer the brain has to waitfor that physical message to come from your toes the further behind you technically arein actually feeling the touch— the further back in the past youre living When theres a delay like that betweensensory information or brain processing we become used to that delay and beginto just see them as instantaneous events which leads to some weird behavior If participants are pushing a button that causes a light to flash with a delaybetween the two actions of about 80 milliseconds they will learn that its instantaneous But if the researchers shorten that distance so that now when the button is pushed the lightflashes in only—lets say— 40 milliseconds the participants even though they are actually causing the light to come onwill deny it and theyll say No way That came on before I pushed the buttonI didnt do it That was also a flash of light But light bulbs dont receive a continuous direct stream of electricity through the wire Instead they receive alternating currentin most businesses and households So the filament is actually being excited and left alone about 50 to 60 times a second But our eyeballs dont notice any flicker for a few reasons One its happening really fast butmainly because that filament continues to be super hot duringthat little gap in time The only way to really see this flicker is to use a high frame rate camera when a light bulb is being turnedon or off so its cooler Theres the flicker You know what else flickers A film projector Its easy to think that a film projector worksmerely because a roll of film is dragged across a light source but if that were the case a movie screen would be a blur of fast moving images Instead a shudder is used The shudder opens and closes to let an image hit the screen and then when shut the next image comes into place and itopens and puts that on the screen Now early films were shot at only about 16 frames per second So sitting in the theater you would see a bright image flashed 16 times on the screen which was not fast enough to not be noticeable So movies flickered which is why they were called flicks which is where we get the word chick flick All right Im gonna go now And of course by now I mean I will leave 80 milliseconds before youbecome aware that Ive left I put three links to previousVsauce videos in the description that are related to this one if youhavent seen them yet One is about why time feelslike its going faster as we get older Another is about the frame rateof the eyeball and the other is about the stoppedclock illusion Have fun and as alwaysthanks for

FART SCIENCE,2012-01-20T00:55:44Z,7.4,3088034,48988,Hey Vsauce Michael here andtoday we are going to talk about farts What are they how do they define usand how much weight do we lose every time we fart Now its easy to think that talking about farts is immature but they are incredibly complicated and by analyzing them because theyre funnyyou could accidentally learn a lot of science Plus we are in great company Mozart wrote songs and poems about flatulence and even Benjamin Franklin once wrotean essay titled Fart Proudly So first things first where do farts come from A lot of the gas that makes up a fart comes from the outside because you swallowed it Thats right you swallow a lot of air whenswallowing spit or food or beverage Now some of this will come back up as a burp but if it doesnt soon enough it will go deeper into your digestive system But its where the other portion of the gas that makes up a fart comes from that makes farts so unique No two peoples farts smell alike The pungent part of a fart is unique to you and it comes from things that are inside you and are not you Inside your intestines are completely separate organisms bacteria and microbes that digest food you havent or cant Now these little guys havea great collective name—gut flora And because they are so  much smaller than the average human cell their numbers are staggering Believe it or not your body contains about ten trillion cells but the number of bacteria and microorganisms inside your intestines is nearly 100 trillion As these microorganisms digest food that you havent or cant they produce helpful things like vitamin K but they also produce chemicals thatlead to the reason that farts smell And we all fart every day about a pint of fart every day And if you say that you dont fart you probably release that gas when youre in the bathroom or at night when youre asleep andyour muscles are more relaxed But if this amount of gas used to beinside you and now its not that must mean that every time you fart you lose mass You lose weight but how much weight Well luckily some researchers have already figured this out Assuming this average chemical makeup of a fart and what studies have shown is the typical volume of a fart it can be calculated that the average fart weighs about three hundredths of a gram and the part of it that actuallystinks only weighs 0008 grams Okay so a fart weighs three hundredths of a gram I mean what does that really meanWell heres a fun way to think about it As you move further away from the center of the earth the gravitational attraction betweenthe two of you decreases and your weight decreases In fact according to this fantasticbook about the scale of things your weight decreases by about 5 percent for every six miles you are above earth In fact the average fart causes you to lose an amount of weight equivalent to being about a third of an inch further from earth The way your gut flora process the food that you eat and influence how your farts smell is established within the firsttwo to three months of your life When youre first born your gastrointestinal tract is completely sterile There are no microorganisms living in it In fact unlike the rest of your life the very first poop that you take is almost completely sterile Its so significant it has a special name meconium Now I will spare you any pictures but if you ever want to call someone a poop headtry instead calling them a meconium head Its like a poop head but with no experience As soon as you leave your mother you begin collecting microorganisms inside your digestive system In fact within the first five to ten minutes of being born the gut flora that you have are almost exactly equivalent to the microorganisms living in your mothers birth canal Now later these microorganisms come from your environment especially from what you eat— milk or formula This early in your life microorganisms train your immune system to not attack them and so within the first two or three months of your life whatever microorganisms are there have largely established themselves as the exact colonial makeup of your gut flora for your entire life Thats all cool but how loud can a fart get Well the Guinness Book of World Records doesnt know In fact there are a lot of records it doesnt keep some of which it doesnt keep because theyre dangerous For instance speed drinking Its possible to open up your throat and literally pour liquid straight down your esophagus into your belly but it is really dangerous andshould never be done by anybody Now burping they do have records of The world record for the largest burp belongs to Paul Hunt from the United Kingdom whoseburp registered 1099 decibels about as loud as a car horn Oh and also many of these microorganisms that live inside your gut and digest food and make farts smell bad also create gases that are flammable Weve all seen this and it is very very true The Mythbusters even did an episode where they prove that farts can be lit on fire but the episode was deemed too gross and never aired Another thing you should know about farts is that when you hold them inmany of the gasses inside them will get reabsorbed back into your blood streamthrough the intestinal lumen Now the smelly stinky stuff doesnt travel this way but the nutrient stuff like oxygen will And the blood stream brings these gasses back to the lungs where you exhale them so if you hold in your farts a lot you in a way will have literal fart breath The Fitzroy River Turtle does one better It can do what I like to call a reverse fart Because it spends so much time under water its developed a way to breathe through its butt It actually can get up to 68 percent of theoxygen it needs by simply opening up that cavity and getting oxygen from the water Finally I want to leave you with the art of the fart The way your farts sound is determined by the speed and the shape of their exit But a select few cannot only make themselves create flatus on command but can also modulate the pitch and tone of their farts These people are known as flatulists And one of the most famous right now is Mr Methane Amazing right Well now that weve talked about fartslets move on to outer space On YouTubecomSpacelab go over there now and you can ask me any question about outer space that you want and every week I will answer three of them So

usually only ever doneon very very young patients because their brains are still plastic enough that the remaining halfwill take on the functions of the half that was removed And its usually donebecause a young child or a baby is having seizures and removingthe part where the seizures occur is the only solution But heres my question If you can live with half a brain what if I were to take two empty skulls and take one half of your brain and plop it into one bodyand the other half and put it in another body which person would be you I mean you are youYou are conscious You are aware of what is happening to you from the perspective of yourselfThink of it this way If you just stare at somethingand kind of feel what it feels like to be you it feels a little bit like youre a thing inside a body looking out through the eyeballs And nobody else on Earth will ever see the world from that position This awareness of your own experiences the awareness that you are having them the awareness that youare having your own thoughts makes up what we call consciousness But if I were to take your brainand split it into two and put it into two different people would both of them be new peoplewho were conscious Well one of the best places to start when defining consciousnessand understanding it is to begin with things that we agreeare not conscious For instance Cleverbot Cleverbotcom is an amazing website where a computer program will respondto your questions really cleverly but only because it is programmed to do so We wouldnt consider it conscious because it doesnt have a sense of itself It doesnt feel anythingIt doesnt have its own inner life Its just a program that respondsautomatically to my inputs Now I know that I am not like Cleverbot I know that I feel thingsand that I have a sense of myself I have intentions But how do I know that you do For that matter how do I knowthat everybody else that I meet is like me How do I know that theyre notjust little smart versions of Cleverbot who know exactly what to automatically say Now what Im asking is incredibly philosophical but it is a very famous and important question Im basically asking if its possiblefor something to exist as a philosophical zombie Thats right a thing that reacts and respondsand acts just like a normal human but yet doesnt actually feel anything It doesnt know that its having its own thoughts It just automatically responds like a robotin the appropriate way Now whats amazing and heavy about this question is that science doesnt have an answer and its not even clear that sciencewill ever have an answer let alone an approach to finding that answer About all we have is the psychologyof disorders of consciousness Lets begin with anosognosia A common example of anosognosiain psychology classes is a patient who has say lost the abilityto move their left hand When asked to raise their right hand theyll say Yeah no problem here you go But then when asked to raise their left hand theyll say Oh yeah sure no problem but not move itAnd when asked why they didnt move their left hand instead of reporting that they cant theyll confabulate some excuse For instance Oh I didnt feel like it AntonBabinski Syndromeis even more dramatic Patients with this syndromeare cortically blind They cannot see anything But they deny being blind If you ask them a question for instanceHow many fingers am I holding up they will make a guessbut if theyre wrong theyll explain their inaccuracywith an excuse For instance oh well I dont have my glasses People who exhibit anosognosia tend to be the victims of stroke and theres some disconnectbetween what theyre really experiencing and their conscious awareness of it They dont know that they cant see because the part of their brainthat monitors visual input isnt telling the brain anything Its not even telling the brainthat there is no visual input which means that the parts of their brain responsible for answering questionsor creating speech has to completely createa confabulated response Despite the fact that weve been able to study patients with anosognosiawe still have no idea how to solve our original problem In fact all weve managedto come up with are more impossible questionsabout identity questions that are so befuddlingthe best you can do with them is to answer them yourselfaccording to what you believe Heres another oneIts called the Swampman Imagine that Im walkingaround in a swamp and then all of a suddenI get struck by a bolt if lightening and my entire body is burned to a crispdissolved into smithereens But the very same momenta second bolt of lightening strikes nearby and it causes a bunch of atoms and molecules to all arrange themselvesinto the exact same configuration that my body used to havemaking a second Michael Is that me Would that be me Heres an even better oneImagine that a surgeon came in and he started removing cellsfrom me and from you replacing them exactly one at a time replacing my cells into your bodyand your cells into my body At what point would Iofficially have become you No one on Earth has the definitive answersto these questions but you know what we do haveA lean back Thats right Ive made a playlistof some of my favorite clips from all over YouTube of psychology experiments and illusions and all sorts of fun stuffthat deal with consciousness All you have to do is click the linkat the top of this videos description and then lean back and let the automatic playlistdo the work for you Ill see you over there and as alwaysthanks for watching Hey Kevin any new YouTube messages Actually yes I just got this messageover at Vsauce 2 from a user who doesnt create videos but he organizes them in his own playlists Yeah yeah thats excellentbecause theres so many videos on YouTube we need people to help organize themespecially by type Imagine a channel of playlists rangingfrom cool songs to listen to when it rains or best explosions ever Exactly If you make a playlistthat you think is really cool and full of stuff that we should know aboutsend it to MichaelVsaucecom and well feature the ones we really like because you have made YouTubea better more organized place And after all Vsauce is kind of like a carpool lane Were all going to getto the cool stuff faster because were traveling together Where did you get

Rainbow Science! ... AND Why Headphones Get So Tangled.,2011-12-27T04:08:55Z,6.166666666666667,4658335,90660,Hey Vsauce Michael here and Im celebrating the holidays in my moms basement But a few days ago MadmegzOfEpic tweetsauce this question Now at first I was like the end of a rainbow Of course you cant get there everybody knows that But then I said why I mean what would happen if I saw a rainbow and I fired a camera bullet at the rainbow What would the footage look like Well I found that in this impossible journey to a rainbow you can learn a lot For instance the rainbow that you see is unique to you Thats right anybody nearby will also see a rainbow but their rainbow will be slightly different Theres a different rainbow for everybody and thats because rainbows  are apparent phenomenon Where you are dictates wherethe rainbow will appear to you Rainbows happen because sunlight behind your body enters into raindrops in front of you that then reflect it back into your eyeballs and theres a rainbow becauseraindrops not only reflect light they also refract it Refraction occurs whenever any type of wave enters a new medium where its speed is changed In order to change speed thatwave must change direction So when white light from the sun enters a raindrop it is refracted It changes direction And different wavelengths of white which means different colors are refracted differently So they get separated into what we know as ROY G BIV The geometry of a spherical raindrop means that this spectrum of colors will only be visible to you from a very specific angle relative to where you are and that angle is about 40 to 42 degrees from the angle of your head to your heads shadow Here is a way to think about it The spectrum of a rainbow is firing out of raindrops between the angle of 40 and 42 degrees So if you move forward youll just see that rainbow coming from different drops except light that reflects morethan one time inside the raindrop Now in order for this light to get to your eyes it has to reflect at a very specific angle So its only visible about 50 to 53 degrees from your perspective and this myfriends is the double rainbow Now again because of spherical geometry these raindrops are not going to beable to reflect light to your eyeballs between 42 to 50 degrees which means the area between a primary and secondary rainbow is darker than the rest of the sky This area is known as Alexanders Dark Band Oh and theres way more thanwe could ever cover here For instance if the sun is already set but the moonis behind you producing enough light you can get a moon bow Also cool reflection rainbows If one of these occurs with a normal rainbow youll have two rainbows thatdont line up that arent parallel The reason is that one of these rainbows is not coming from sunlight behind the viewer but instead from sunlight reflected from the lake below Because you can only see a rainbow from a certain angle if you move your body you will continue to see that rainbow from the same angle which means the rainbow will move with you It will appear to be following you This is particularly apparent when youre flying in an airplane high above the ground moving quickly Now because youre so far off the ground the rainbow which is centered around your shadow is actually 100 percent completely visible which means none of it is hiding below the horizon which means you see a circular rainbow And as you can see as the plan flies through the clouds the rainbow continues to be inthe same apparent position So if I fired a bullet camera right at a rainbow the rainbow would not get closer instead it would appear to recede just as fast as the camera approached it Rainbow is a classic compound word a word that is made up of two or more wordsthat can stand on their own So lets unpack these a bit beginning  with bow A decorative knot Here are some brand new headphones Theyre perfectly together everythings fine and theyre perfectly straight But quickly after being in my pocket or in a backpack headphones inevitably tie themselves up into weird knots The same goes for Christmastree lights and electrical wires Why does that happen  I mean are there some kind of like weird evil elf sneaking around when were not looking tying wires into knots Maybe but probably not The answer lies in mathematics Mathematicians have jiggled strings around inside boxes to determine not only what types of knots will randomly occur but how often they will And of course what they found is that its much more likely for astring to fall into a knotted position that a relatively rare unknotted one Furthermore once a string is knotted it resists being untied which ispretty much the definition of a knot So it will remain knotted and twisted up until a person comes along and unties it But what about rain Well we know that rain is part of whats responsible for the visual experience of a rainbow but what about the ole factory sensation of rain— the smell of rain Theres actually a name for the way rain smells Its called petrichor Naturalists have given the smell of rain a name because they have found a specific cause for the smell of rain During dry times plants exude in oil and the point of this oil is to slow down seed germination and plant growth so they can wait until theres more water But once the rain comes this oil is washed into the air and we smell it creating petrichor—the smell of rain So the next time you smell rain think about this word Petrichorand where it comes from Youre not just smelling nature or certain plant oils you are smelling by definition the blood of stone the blood of the earth of the ground And as always thanks for watching,164.75675675675674,becauseraindrops,0.0,1.0,7k85eD_tQZo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k85eD_tQZo
What's Left?,2011-12-22T01:53:22Z,4.9,4708813,102018,Hey VsauceMichael here And today were going to talk about thisJust kidding Were going to talk about thisLeft Whats leftFirst of all 90 of humans regardless of culture or language are righthandedAnd we choose a dominant hand before weve even left our mothersThats right When a baby inside its mothers womb is seensucking its thumb it is sucking the right thumb 90 of the timeAnimals do it too In fact horses take longer strides with theirright legs which is the entire reason racetracks are run counterclockwiseLefthandedness is so rare that across most cultures there has been a historical stigmaagainst being lefthanded In fact the word for somehow whos good atusing both hands is ambidextrous and dexter comes from Latin for rightSo when you call somebody ambidextrous youre not saying that theyre good with using bothhands youre telling them that they have two right handsAnd if someone is unable to use either hand theyre called ambisinister because in Latinsinister means left But why do we have to have a dominant handin the first place Why cant we all just be awesome with bothhands Well the fault lies in the brainNow brain wants to be efficient so it divvies up tasks to specific regions and it tendsto avoid sending too much information between both hemispheres because doing so would requireusing the corpus callosum which would take more time and energyNow the way the brain works is kind of funny The left side of the brain controls the rightside of the body and the right side of the brain controls the left side of the bodySo it makes sense that the hand youre best doing precise stuff with would correlate tothe hemisphere of the brain that does the most precise processingIn 95 of righthanded people its the left hemisphere that deals with precise languagethinking like definitions But when youre lefthanded theres abouta 40 chance that youre using the right hemisphere or bothAnd this is where things get interesting Now being lefthanded or ambidextrous doesnot mean that your brain works in one way or the otherBut it may help explain why across averages ambidextrous people sometimes score loweron IQ tests or why a greater proportion of schizophrenics are lefthanded or ambidextrousthan the rest of the population Now that said there are giant benefits tohaving a brain like that By sending information back and forth morenovel connections are made more creative ideas are madeAlbert Einstein was lefthanded And 5 of the last 7 US presidents have beenlefthanded Theres something else lefthanded peoplehave an advantage with  keyboards On a QWERTY keyboard thousands and thousandsof English words can be typed using the left handBut on the right side of the keyboard you can only write maybe about a 100 or soOn the left side of a keyboard the left hand all on its own can type pretty long somewhatcommon words like stewardesses reverberated and desegregatedBut on the righthand side the longest common word you can type is lollipopOh look a spacebar When people go to space they have left EarthThe first person to leave Earth into space was Yuri Gagarin a Soviet cosmonautBut the one Im interested in was the fourth man into space Gherman TitovHe may have only been the fourth person into space but he was the first person to haveleft Earth and simultaneously left wakefulness Titov was the first person to sleep in spaceAnd heres whats really fun He was 25 years old when he did it whichmeans that to this day Titov is the youngest human who has ever been to spaceYou know what else leaves Earth HeliumThats right Helium gas that we use in balloons is lighterthan air and so molecules of helium rise all the way to the very tip top of our atmospherewhere they get picked off by solar wind meaning that they leave us foreverIn fact theres a little bit of a concern over how much helium we have left becausethe only way helium comes into existence on Earth is through radioactive decayAlpha particles are essentially helium nuclei and we find a lot of helium inside naturalgas But right now were using a lot of it andhelium is quite cheap so theres a realistic concern that within the next 30 or 40 yearswe may have no helium left Thanks for watching,145.51020408163265,counterclockwiseLefthandedness,0.0,1.0,DU3OdTLuHf0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU3OdTLuHf0
How Much Money is LOVE Worth?,2011-12-16T06:29:50Z,5.4,4065483,83174,Hey VsauceMichael here And Im in Los Angeles but today were goingto talk about love You cant buy love but what if you couldI mean what if I had a machine that could make you fall in love with someone for therest of your life What should I charge for the use of that machineWell we should first of all be clear about what we mean when we say loveIm not talking about the love you have for your BFFs or your love for your family oryour love of learning Im also not talking about lust an immediateattraction we have towards other people mediated by hormones like testosterone and oestrogenIm talking about what happens later when you begin to associate an immediate rewardwith one other person  what we call passionate loveThis is what you see in new couples where they wanna be with each other and are almostobsessed with each other Well psychologists have a really great termfor that kind of love They call it limerenceThats right Whenever youre in this state and you do thingslike wake up super early to get a bagel with the person and even though youre gonna missclass just because you wanna see them that badly youre exhibiting limerent behaviourOkay that sounds great But if I wanna sell love Im gonna have tofind a way to measure it and it turns out to be quite a difficult taskWe do have a tool called the passionate love surveyIt was developed by psychologists and its been found to be quite reliable when it comesto analysing other behaviours we associate with passionate loveFor instance we found using the survey that men and women both experience the sameamounts of passionate love when theyre in a relationshipWeve also found that men tend to fall in the love faster and sooner than women whoappear to be more cautious But were here to talk about moneyInterestingly a UK study once looked at people who heard that someone else loved themThey heard the phrase I love you for the first time and they took the amount of happinessthose people felt and compared it to the amount of happiness gamblers feel when they win largesums of money Their conclusion that hearing that someoneloves you for the first time is the equivalent happiness level of receiving 267000 dollarsBut when you go beyond passionate love to committed longterm love theres all kindsof practical benefits marriage brings In fact its been estimated that tax breaksand health care costs all together mean that being married is the equivalent of receivingan extra 100000 dollars a year Now we have a lot of ways of visualizing theeffect having money has on a person For instance we know that in wealthier countriespeople report feeling respect more often They also report eating tastier foods forinstance But heres whats really awesomeTake a look at the graph of wealth against love It doesnt matter Love is democratic no matter who you areor how much money you have people all over the world are feeling itIt should be noted that having more money does not necessarily equate to being morehappy This is whats known as the hedonistic treadmillGetting more money helps with happiness but only up to a certain pointIn United States that point is about 75000 dollars a yearAt that point more money has diminishing returns on how happy it makes youAnother thing that correlates to having more money more wealth is living longer havinga larger life expectancy But you know what else correlates to livinglonger LoveBut not just passionate love the kind of love that follows it  committed longtermlove In fact people who form lifelong pair bondswith another person live on average 15 longerSo if you wanna be really nonhardsciency about it all other things being equal andassuming that youre not already super super rich finding a pair bond finding a relationshipthat lasts for life is the equivalent of making about an extra 30 to 40 thousand dollars ayear Now like I said thats not hard sciencebut you know what is Vasopressin and oxytocin the chemicals thatare exuded in peoples brains when they look at photos of people that they formedcommitted longterm relationships with These chemicals are incredibleWeve also seen elevated levels of them in dogs that have been pet for really long timeAnd we also know that couples who receive high levels of these chemicals resolve conflictsfaster And people who struggle to produce thesechemicals in their brain have a similar struggle when it comes to forming longterm relationshipsIn fact you can raise your levels of oxytocin or vasopressin inside your own brain by simplylooking into someone elses eyes Thats rightSo in a way looking into the eyes of somebody that you like is the administration of a psychoactivedrug thats addictive and the longterm consequences are living longer Thanks for watching,148.14814814814815,immediateattraction,0.0,1.0,Jf7Uo6nqaIg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7Uo6nqaIg

SOUNDS.,2011-12-03T21:53:33Z,6.183333333333334,3599062,63686,Hey VsauceMichael here And Im with Destin in AlabamaWhat hes about to do is capture on a Phantom camera at a 1080 frames a second a hawk  thatone  catching a target But today were going to talk about soundFirst things first The Raptor Center takes care of raptors thathave been injured or would otherwise not be able to survive in the wild on their ownFor instance this bald eagle named Spirit who was hit by a car that damaged his beak Okay so that is the bald eagle Very interesting sound that it makesBut what Im interested in today is the recording of soundIt hasnt really been that long in humans history that weve able to record soundsIn fact it wasnt until 1859 with the invention of the phonautograph in Paris that we firstrecorded sound It really blows your mind to listen to thisWhat youre about to hear is the very first recording ever of any kind of sound One thing I found fascinating was that these large birds have such high metabolisms thatin order to figure out if theyre hungry or not all you have to do is weigh themAnd if a bird weighs too much it means its not hungry and so they wont bring it outto fly cause it might not come back Its not hungry its not gonna obey commandsto get little bits of food But lets now time travel to 1860 and listento the very earliest recording of the human voiceWhat youre about to hear is the voice of the inventor of the phonautograph signinga French folk song Three years after that recording Abraham Lincolndelivered The Gettysburg Address and three hours before he gave the speech this photowas taken The only known photo of Lincoln at the historicevent It dedicated a cemetery in Pennsylvania tothe Battle of Gettysburg the deadliest battle of America Civil War where more than 23000 men died Now in attendance was a 9 year old boy namedWilliam V Rathvon And in 1938 as he neared the end of his lifeRathvon took a copy of the speech and recorded himself delivering it as he remembered Lincolnspeaking it We dont have any audio of Lincoln deliveringthe speech which makes this recording the only one done by an eyewitness of the eventPretty mindblowing But what about sounds we dont wanna hearFor instance fingernails scratching against a blackboardWell there are a lot of theories about why that sound affects us so viscerally and soimmediately Some of them argue that the sound of the scratchingmay mimic an early warning cry of early humans But more recent research suggests that itsactually certain frequencies inside that scratching sound specifically those between 2000 and4000 Hz A range similar to the human voiceOur ear canals actually amplify those frequencies so that we can hear them better but whenit comes to the scratching of things on a chalkboard or styrofoam against styrofoamthose frequencies become too loud making it painfulOkay now lets leave Earth and listen to sounds from outer spaceNow I know what youre thinking sound in outer space is impossibleSound waves need a medium to travel through and in space you practically have a vacuumI know But heres something really neatThe radio antenna on Voyager I was broadcasting the signal back to Earth as Voyager passedthrough the rings of Saturn What youre about to listen to is that broadcastand all the static and pings you hear are actual pieces of Saturns rings hitting theradio antenna But would outer space really be silent ifI were to walk right out of a space craft into itI mean I wouldnt survive very long because of a lack of air a lack of air pressurefreezing temperatures radiation it would be really terribleBut even though sound waves could not travel through space itself there is a medium thatthe sound can travel through My bodyThats right As my blood boiled and my body inflated itwould vibrate my bones it would vibrate my body and in turn vibrate my ear drum whichis something that we experience every day if you own a Justin Bieber singing toothbrushSpecial toothbrushes like these vibrate in a way that you can barely hear but as soonas you bite down on it the vibrations go through your jaw and jiggle your eardrum and you heara quite high fidelity version of Justin Biebers Baby or You Smile which is funBut what this really means is that in space no one can hear you screamBut you can hear yourself inflate Okay as you guys know Im in Alabama withDestin from SmarterEveryDay Now even though I grew up in Kansas Ivenever in my entire life fired a gun Well Destin is a ballistics expert hesone of the smartest guys Ive ever met And tonight hes gonna let me fire a gun forthe first time in my life This is a 9mm bullet quite commonThis is not gonna be the first thing I shoot in my lifeThis is A 50 caliber bullet Destin says its a goodidea and that Ill be okay because I have a beard And as always thanks for watching,137.14285714285714,toothbrushSpecial,0.0,-0.9,ghy-FMZSJR0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghy-FMZSJR0

‌‌,2011-11-16T01:21:07Z,6.5,16407370,705760,Hey Vsauce Michael here coming to you from my hotel room in London with a little camera that I taped to a bunch offurniture I stacked up Which is better than nothing and as youcan tell from the title of this video its also what were going to discuss Nothing Can there ever be nothingI mean were surrounded by matter all the time Even this glass is not empty I know you might think theres nothing in itbut its full of air And air is packed One cubic centimeter of air contains almost 30 quintillion molecules But if I remove the air from this glass I can create what is known as a vacuum an awesome word that uses a double u but not a w The challenge however is removingall of the air To this day the best scientists have been able to do is to create what they call an ultrahigh vacuum At this point one cubic centimeter of space contains not 30 quintillion molecules but a mere and amazing 100 To put that in perspective a vacuum cleaner like you use at home hardly changesthe thinness of the air at all In fact if you use a vacuum cleaner at sea level the vacuum created inside the operational part of the machine only has the thinness of air foundin Denver Colorado If you want thinner air if you want evenfewer particles per cubic centimeter youre going to have to leave earth But before we go too far lets talk abouthigh altitude flying When youre in an airplane 30000 feet high the outside air is very thin and dangerous So by law the airplane must keep the inside of that commercial aircraft pressurized so that it only feels like youre no more than 8000 feet high The reason its dangerous is thatwhen air gets that thin theres not enough oxygen for your brain This man is about to remove his masktemporarily and with supervision in the actual thinness of the air around him Within less than a minute  he suffers from hypoxia a lack of oxygen Even though he appears to be awake and alert when told to put his mask back on or else he will die he does nothing But a lack of oxygen a lack of air a lack of matter can get even more dangerous whenyou go above 60000 feet about 19000 meters above the surface of the earth This limit is known as Armstrongs Limit We all know that the boiling point of water decreases as your altitude increases and at Armstrongs limit the boiling point for your own blood drops all the way down to the temperature of your own body If you reach that altitude without wearing a special suit bubbles will form inside your blood and your body will inflate to twice its normal size But because your internal organs andyour skin are flexible you wont explode So lets talk about out gassing Out gassing is why its so difficultfor us to reach an ultra high vacuum If you remove so much air from this glass theres fewer than 100 particles per cubic centimeter The glass itself or whatever materialyour chamber is made out of will start to lose its own trapped gasses But materials dont need to be insidepartial vacuums to out gas It happens all the time and isespecially noticeable in confined spaces For instance a car All of the adhesives and chemicals used to make that car will out gas and collect inside creating what we know as the new car smell All right time to leave earth for good Lets go into the space between planets Now remember that in a laboratory the best vacuum weve been able to create is about 100 particles per cubic centimeter Well between the planets and our solar system there is space that only contains ten particles per cubic centimeter And if you leave our solar system in the innerstellar space youre only going to find about one particle per cubic centimeter The real winner though is intergalactic space Leave the Milky Way altogether and you can find regions where theres only one or two particlesper cubic meter Okay thats cool and all but would it be possible to find a region of space where there is absolutely and literally nothing no matter at all Well according to quantum mechanics no First of all youve got gravitational and electromagnetic fields that extend forever because the particles that cause those fields to happen have no mass whatsoever And this is whats really mind blowing theres a thing known as virtual particlesthats happening all the time even around us right now where theres no vacuum These virtual particles come intoexistence and then disappear And we believe they exist for a couple of reasons One big reason is the fact that our universe continues to expand even though thatshouldnt necessarily happen Where are we getting that extra force that pushes it that causes it to keep expanding Well these particles that pop intoexistence and disappear may be the answer Even crazier is an effect weve observedknown as the Casimir Force If you put two pieces of metal nanometersapart inside a vacuum they will be pushed together One of the most popular theories for why this happens is that these virtual particles poppinginto space and then disappearing are actually reflecting off of the metal But because the plates are so close together particles with wavelengths longer than that gap dont get reflected so theres more virtual particles pushing on the outside than the inside and the metal plates contact I know these concepts have gotten pretty crazy but rest assured that really all it means is that whenever you feel down and feel like nothing matters youre scientifically incorrect Nothing matters there cant be nothing Theres always matter theres always something And as always thanks for

ENGLISH.,2011-11-12T00:10:59Z,6.966666666666667,4366894,81788,Hey Vsauce Michael here and today weregoing to talk about this Whats happening right now—the English language A language spoken by more than a billionpeople with many many different accents And according to last years Harvard Google study a language with more than a million words growing at a rate of 8500 new wordsevery single year But were getting ahead of ourselvesWhere did English begin Well for that answer were going to have to goall the way back to the year 400 and even earlier to this little Germanic peninsula jutting off at an angle inhabited by people whoappropriately were called Angles Now these Angles began immigrating toan island named Britain In fact there were so many Angles there you may as well have called it Angle Land Angle Land England Before they had Latin characters they wrote their language not in lettersbut in what are known as roons And everything was fine and dandy until 1066 when the Normans invaded and won One of the neatest changes that still affects us today is the fact that this new Norman ruling class would refer to the meat they were served using their own words like beef or pork But the poor old Anglo Saxons whohad to tend to the animals still used their early old English words for instancecow and pig And to this day that is why English is one of the very few languages on Earth that has a different name for the meatof an animal than the name of the animal it came from English did this a lot borrow words from other languages and other people and just plop it right down into the English vocabulary So see English is really fun or should I say fun is really English Thats right unlike all of these borrowed words the word fun can be traced all the way back to the Angles and the protogermanic word phono which referred to a piece of cloth or  rag It eventually came to mean a piece of fabricsay a hoisted flag that flew in the breeze And then it just came to mean anythingthat was high flying or buoyant you know like fun stuff Singling out which words in English were borrowed and which ones were originally Germanic could be a pretty fun exercise for instance supervise is derived from Latin but overseethats straight up Germanic Well what would English sound likeif we just got rid of all these words that didnt originally come from the Angles Well what you would have is what is knownas Anglish Anglish is really fun to read because itsnot really a real language its just an exercise that we can do nowadays My favorite is this passage explaining atomic theory Of course you cant call it atomic theory because for instance the word atom is Greek meaning something that cannot be dividedany further so instead of using the word atom writers will use words like uncleft And instead of using a word like theory theyll use a word like beholding Theres a link in the description to read allof uncleft beholding But now lets talk about accents We dont all speak English the same way and as a confession Im going to sayIm terrible at impressions—accents dialects— I pretty much only ever talk like this Luckily I read the science and young children are the best at picking up new accents So I brought along my friend Todd Nicely doneThank youClassic Vsauce move Now Todd is from  and he is fantastic at accents Gratzi Michael gratzi Im impressed every day But heres achallenge for you are you ready ChallengeI want you to do an impression of exactly how you think George Washington spoke Let me just picture him Ive seen him on a quarter before I think he probably sounded like this Wassup players So yall gonna vote for me I aint gonna take two terms just give me one  one shot uh one and done baby you know what Im saying Naw seriously father I did notchop down that cherry tree I like that but you know whatTheres no way to be wrong Well I mean there are ways to be wrongbut we dont know the real answer because back at the time that Americafirst became a country the classic British accentdidnt even exist yet I quite like the Queens English yes Yeah that would be completely foreign to them But heres whats really mind blowing about what the British gave to America— southern drawl Thats right these people known as the cavaliers came over to America before it wasan actual independent country and they brought things like the word yall snickerdoodle varmit and they brought the word axed instead of ask and the word aint As well as emphasizing the first syllable of words like guitar July and police Man Ive taken a lot of heat from English people from being from Texas and all that and they started it didnt they But listen to this the bo language was a language spoken on an island off the coast of India and then last year this woman died She was the final speaker of the language All I can think about is that lady trying to connect to people like oh let us share in the cultural joke you know the famous cultural joke of the Bo people Yes yes it was probably quite lonely Todd Modern English as we know it didnt really begin that long ago Think of it this way theres a time capsule buried here in New York that is not going to be opened until the year 6939 By then English itself may be completely different or possibly extinct and so they actually included a drawing of the human mouth where they diagrammed out where you need to put your tongue to say the letters like we say them today And we only have to wait almost 5000 years What a bargain how convenient for everyone Yeah what are we gonna do in the meantime Well you could head over to mychannel for some comedy stuff We did an episode of Vsauce called Vsauce Unplugged Theres a lot of meat information over there about the brain and language some joking around and I got to talk to Dale Dale the mouse He does not play aroundNo Be sure to check out the cheese shorts over on Todds channel Its much more funny than Vsauce but when youre there and every time Im there Im just impressed by the characters and the accents and the language Weve got all sorts of stuff weve got behind the scenes awesome stuff we got stand up weve got me going to China weve got all sorts of comedy stuff Come over for a visit Ill give you a bowl of soup come on Yeah come on Ill see you thereand as always thanks for

What is Déjà vu?,2011-11-05T21:33:56Z,6.6,12073883,341062,Hey Vsauce Michael here And today weregoing to discuss déjà vu What is it and why does it occur You know those momentswhere the current situation feels like its happened before Youre certain it has butyou dont know when or how it became so familiar Its difficult to scientifically study déjà vu because theres no reliable way to cause it to happen in peoples heads in a laboratory But heres what we do know humans dont seemto experience déjà vu until theyre at least 8 or 9 years old Its most frequent in yourteens and twenties and then tapers off as you get older So it might have somethingto do with brain development In fact we should probably go get ourselves a brainThat was easy Now like a stomach ache déjà vu may be a symptom with many possible causesA lot of the popular theories about what causes it involve a disconnect that may be occurringbetween the deep structures of the brain that process our experiences unconsciously andthe parts of the brain that are conscious of what they experience process it andthen tell us what were seeing For the sake of simplicity lets begin withthe visual system Now the brain sits in your head like this and your eyeballs areover here seeing things sending that signal to the back of the brain the Occipital lobewhere visual cortex is Thats where the image is processed and we become aware of what wereseeing But visual cortex isnt the first stop that information makes Instead we knowthat it stops in lots of other places For instance the amygdala where it may be processedat an involuntary emotional level and this fun little part right here 31 the tectumIts involved in preliminary visual processing and helps control eye movements Now that fact is incredibly important becausewhat it means is that people with blindness caused by brain damage to the visual cortexcannot see anything They dont report seeing or recognizing anything however the otherpreliminary parts of the brain that get that message are still healthy and so despitebeing legally blind these people exhibit what is known as blindsight They can defy all odds and avoid an obstaclecourse on the ground They can also be presented faces showing joy or anxiety and fear andfeel without knowing why at all on Earth they feel that way a similar emotion So a lot is going on when we look at thingsand if those preliminary structures in the vision system allow certain blind people tobe oddly and unconsciously aware of what theyre looking at we may have the ingredients weneed for this disconnect Think of it this way If I experience eventA and then B and then C and the inner parts of my brain commit it to memory and generatean emotional response but then a fraction of a second later outofsync my visualcortex finally gets around to telling me the conscious aware part of my brain whatIm seeing It will say Ok guys were looking at A and then B and then and then thebrain says Whoa whoa whoa wait wait and then C right Thats already happenedI thought and that may be déjà vu But what could cause these processes dealingwith the same information to get temporarily outofsync like that Well its probablya neurological abnormality possibly an epileptic episode where neurons all fire in sync Wealso know that patients who experience chronic and persistent déjà vu tend to have braindamage in the temporal lobes of their brain  these lobes on either side Well that sounds kinda bad right I mean when Iexperience déjà vu should I run to the doctor right away Well not at all In fact minorepileptic events are quite common Youve probably experienced a similar phenomenonknown as a Hypnagogic Jerk Thats a fancy name for what occurs when youre about tofall asleep and then all of the sudden you feel like youre falling or that you trippedand your body jolts itself awake Whats going on there is that as you fallasleep your muscles relax and some part of your brain thats still awake notices thatand feels like youre no longer supported  you must be falling  and it sends out a hugesignal that causes all of your muscles to twitch waking you up Oh and déjà vu is not the only vu out thereTheres also something known as Presque vu or tip of the tongue and this is what happenswhen youre familiar with something you know you know it but for the life of you at thatmoment you cannot recall it Its like whats that actors name from that movie Ive seenit 18 times how can I not remember it Wow One explanation of how that happens is thatother words similar to the target word are being remembered and to help you out yourbrain is actively blocking other stuff around it including the word youre actually lookingfor Now this explanation is really nice cause it might actually explain why Presquevu has a shared or social aspect Even a bunch of people in a group all with separatebrains if theyre given the same blocking words that are related no one in the groupcan come up with the name until the subject is changed and those words are no longer blockedand then all the sudden someone goes Oh Gary Sinise thats who it was Yup thereyou go Ok finally Jamais vu This is when somethingthat you know something that youre familiar with all of a sudden seems brand new and bizarreSchizophrenic patients will sometimes see people they know and insist that its notthe person they know Instead its an imposter But all of us have probably experienced Jamaisvu to a certain extent for instance when you repeat a word over and over and overand over again the word starts to lose its meaning and you start to think What Howis this even a word Its so weird Well scientists believe that happens because continuingto excite the neurons responsible for that word causes them to become inhibited andfurther use is less intense It is just crazy to think that there is somuch out there in the world in the universe that we dont know that we dont understandthat we havent yet discovered But yet that very feeling of familiarity for whatwe do know cant always be trusted About the only constant seems to be As always thanks for

How Much Does The Internet Weigh?,2011-10-29T20:52:46Z,4.183333333333334,5361850,100175,Hey VsauceMichael here And this strawberry weights about 50 grams whichaccording to Russell Seitz also happens to be the weight of the entire InternetWhat does that mean I mean the Internet is a gigantic place andhow do you measure information Well lets start a little bit smaller witha Kindle Right now Im reading Gadsby which is agreat novel that makes complete sense except it was written without ever using the lettere which is awesome But when I put Gadsby on my Kindle did myKindle gain weight Well theoretically yes it didInformation is stored on flash drives like this and on my Kindle in binaryAnd that binary physically exists because electrons charge floating gate transistorsAnd the thing about electrons is that they have massIn fact a professor at Berkeley estimated that when a Kindle is completely full of booksits weight increases by about 10 to the negative 18th gramsThat number is mind blowingly miniscule In fact he says that when you fully chargea Kindles battery it gains 100 million times more mass than it does when you fill it withbooks But even then the number is impossible tomeasure The most specific scales weve ever createdonly measure to about 10 to the negative 9th gramsSo lets get bigger Russell Seitz came up with his measurementbecause the Internet is composed of networks of servers and theyre about 75 to 100 millionservers operating to make the Internet work Combined that many servers equal about 40billion Watts of electricity and we know that an Amp is about 10 to the 18th electrons persecond And since we know the weight of an electronwe can calculate that the entire Internet is really just about 50 grams of electronsin motion Now that number only includes serversAnd Seitz says that if you wanna include the chips in personal computers as well the numbersabout 3 times larger But theres a weight of the Internet thatimpresses me a little bit more Its a calculation not of the energy it takesto serve the Internet but the energy contained in the actual informationThe videos the pictures the emails How much do they all collectively weigh whenstored Well heres the thingIt takes about 8 billion electrons to store one email8 billion sounds like a lot but electrons are tiny and so one email only weighs abouttwo tenthousandths of a quadrillionth of an ounceBut the Internet contains lots of emails and it contains lots of video and images andcelebrity rumours so how much does it weigh altogetherWell the first question we have to ask is how big is the Internet and thats difficultto calculate but Eric Schmidt thenCEO of Google once estimated that the entire Internetcontains about 5 million Terabytes of information of which he said Google has only indexed0004 Okay so not counting the energy it takesto deliver the Internet the information itself on the Internet is about 5 million TerabytesNow we know how many electrons it takes to form a single byte and we know the mass ofan electron and so with a little bit of math you can figure out that the entire Interneteverything on it collectively only weighs 02 millionths of an ounceThink of it this way every single video on YouTube every single video across the entireweb every single image every single website every email youve sent every loveletter youve written every photo of your grandkids youve received is collectivelyheld within an amount of mass about the size of the smallest possible grain of sandIf you follow tweetsauce on Twitter you can learn even moreIm gonna share some more facts there that I didnt include in this video around electricity ingeneral Like us on Facebook to show that youre classy And as always thanks for watching,147.25099601593624,measurementbecause,0.0,1.0,WaUzu-iksi8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaUzu-iksi8

Why Do We Dream?,2011-10-18T23:11:14Z,6.533333333333333,10823128,275676,hey Vsauce Michael here and today we are going to talk about why we dream whats going on inside our brains the scientific study of dreaming is called Anaya ology and for most of history it didnt really exist because you cant hold a dream its difficult to measure a dream you cant taste it you cant see other peoples dreams and if you ask them to tell you what they dreamt the results are almost always unreliable in fact its estimated that we forget 95 of the dreams we have especially within the first 10 minutes of having them but then in 1952 something amazing happened researchers at the University of Chicago found this its a unique type of electrical activity that occurs during a certain stage of a persons sleeping when researchers awoke people during this stage they almost always reported that they had been dreaming also at the same time during this stage peoples eyeballs are going crazy rapidly darting all over the place underneath their eyelids you can actually see this happening if you watch people sleep like I usually do during REM sleep some pretty bizarre stuff happens if you look at the electrical activity of a brain that is in REM sleep that almost exactly mimics the way the brain acts when its awake the biggest difference being that the production of chemicals inside the brain like norepinephrine serotonin and histamine is almost completely blocked and that causes the muscles to stop moving which is why you can dream about flying or running around or fighting ninjas but your body doesnt move people who have a disorder achieving complete REM a topia move around in their sleep and act out their dreams they can even get out of bed and sleepwalk oh before you move forward I should say two things one is that its possible to wake up and not be able to move your body because youre still in rem a topia youre completely conscious and you know that youre awake but your body is not ready to move on the flipside you can also be inside a dream and know that youre dreaming this phenomenon is known as lucid dreaming and its particularly attractive because while Im in a lucid dream I can conscious decisions about what I do I can go fly to wherever I want or I can have a tea party with Abraham Lincoln Im in control but achieving a lucid dream is quite elusive Howcast has a great video which Ive put in the description that gives some tips and tricks on how to achieve one researchers were able to deprive mice of REM sleep by using this inverted inside a tub of water way up to the tippy top meaning that the mouse was only able to sit right on top of this little tiny surface when that happens the mouse can still fall into non REM sleep but as soon as they reach REM sleep and their muscles relaxed they fall off the platform into the water waking up what they found was that when mice are not allowed to achieve REM sleep they have an incredible amount of trouble remembering things this happens in humans too if you have people remember word pairs and then you dont allow them to sleep the next day their memory for that stuff is incredibly terrible but memory and REM does not stop there if a person learns a difficult new task during the day say a new instrument or a new type of difficult puzzle you can measure the electrical activity in their brain while they do that and then while they sleep that night whether they know it or not their brain replays those electronic impulses many popular theories about why we dream are variations on the idea that while we sleep the unconscious part of our brain is busy organizing memories and strengthening connections from the day before that we need in the future while getting rid of the junk that would otherwise clog the brain now so the theory goes these electrical impulses are detected by our conscious brain and our cortex freaks out and doesnt know what it means and so it tries its best to create a cohesive story creating a dream this would explain why dreams are often so fantastic and seemingly random theyre not supposed to make sense theyre not an actual message from our brain its just the results of our cortex is trying to synthesize the noise coming from all the work being done back in the unconscious under this way of thinking dreams are an epiphenomena theyre not a primary process that has a purpose instead theyre the accidental result of a more important process is going on behind the conscious brain but some researchers dont believe that they believe the dreams serve a primary purpose and that purpose is to prepare us for threats they think this because the most prevalent emotions felt during dreams are negative abandonment anger and the most common of all anxiety the theory goes like this back when we were early humans especially we had no idea what kind of threats we might encounter during the day and so to prepare us our brain would simulate anxieties while we slept to make us better prepared for that feeling in the real world so people who had terrifying dreams were better at dealing with anxiety in the real world and had stronger genes all right so the theories we discussed today are quite popular but they dont really enjoy a consensus not everyone agrees on them and they barely scratched the surface of scientific thought about dreams but thats kind of the cool thing about dreams think of it like this here is the Eagle Nebula a giant structure in outer space 6500 light years away but despite its distance we pretty much know what its made out of we know that its a hundred trillion kilometres tall we know what caused it and we know where its gonna be in 750 million years but last night I had dreams and no one really knows why or for what reason and thats pretty cool and thats why thanks for watching if you want to learn more about the world I highly recommend smarter every day its a show here on YouTube by a guy named Destin who Ive

How Old Can We Get?,2011-10-15T18:39:33Z,4.566666666666666,12663812,312159,Hey Vsauce Michael here And today we are going to talk about time specifically how much time we have Whats the oldest a personcan ever be Well the world record for the worlds longest living person belongs to JeanneCalment a French woman who lived to be 122 Right now at this very moment there areonly 37 people alive who were born in the 1800s Those 37 people have lived in threedifferent centuries But as medical knowledge expands and our understanding of biology improvespeople are living longer and longer In fact scientists believe that based on statisticsthe first person who will ever live to be 150 has already been born It could be oneof you But according to the math its probably someone who was born last year Heres the thing As humans get older thelikelihood of them dying increases but there are some types of animals that have what iscalled Negligible Senescence also known as biological immortality and these types ofanimals have never been observed to actually age Animals like the Hydra can only diebecause of accidents disease or predators The worlds oldest living individual treehas clocked in at more than 4600 years old Its called the Methuselah Tree and it existssomewhere in this forest Government officials wont actually release its exact locationto protect it from vandalism but its out there The lifespan of an organism can be even longerthan that if you include clonal colonies For instance these Quaking Pines all looklike individual trees but theyre actually all clones of one genetic code They all sharea root system and the root system continues to make more trees meaning that these treesare all part of the same organism and experts have calculated based on the roots systemthat this one male Quaking Pine has been around for at least 80000 years But lets get back to humans and ratherthan talking about how time is lets talk about how time feels Intense moments of your lifeare remembered as lasting much longer than times that were relatively dull Psychologistssay that the reason for this is that our brains take deeper and richer memories of eventsthat are novel or events that are intense than ones that arent When your experiences are intense and novelyoure not remembering more things about it but you are making more copies Rather thanjust making normal memories during stress the amygdala gets involved and also remembersthings and many people believe that is why intense moments are remembered as lasting longer This phenomenon becomes quite mindblowingon a macroscale Think of it this way when you are a oneyearold baby one year represents100 percent of your life but when your turn two years old that second year was only halfyour life and the next year you live through is only a third of your life and by the timeyou turn 80 one year only represents an 80th of your life Those percentages are importantbecause they may explain why your childhood feels like it took so long but as you getolder the years seem to fly by You have more novel experiences when youreyoung You first learn a language you first see your mother you first learn to walkyou have your first kiss These are all deeply and richly remembered by your brain and solater on it feels as if they took longer to happen Now heres whats really mindblowing Letslook at a graphical representation of the percentage of your life that each successiveyear is The first year is 100 percent the second year is only half the third year isa third and soon will go alltheway out to 80 Now using this representation underthis model when you turn 80 years old and look back at your life the point that feelslike the middle isnt your 40s its your early 20s The good news here is that the more novel thingsyou do and things you see and places you visit and people you meet the slower timefeels and the more rich it feels So go out there and do something cool do somethingweird do something new Subscribe to Vsauce if you havent already And as always thanks for watching,150.2189781021898,Psychologistssay,0.0,1.0,6LyCC6jjcx8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LyCC6jjcx8

WATER.,2011-09-12T15:54:41Z,4.35,6965304,129722,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd Im in London right outside Buckingham Palace Oh Im actually running a little bit latefor tea with the Queen Yeah shes really into teabut do you know what teas mainly made out of Water and so todaywere going to talk about water Now we all know that wateris vital for life on Earth to existand that water covers more than 70of Earths surface but before we talkabout liquid water I want to talkabout a culinary treat that occurs when you put a piece of breadon the ground and then at the exact same timeon the other side of the Earth the exact geographical opposite pointyou have someone else put another piece of bread—Earth sandwich Thats right—its a challengethat was popularized by Ze Frank and it turns outthat making an Earth sandwich is incredibly difficultWhy Because of waterThats right If you take a globeand you look at it so that France is right therein the middle youre only looking at onehalfof the Earth but from that perspectiveyou are looking at almost 90of Earths dry land Its all right there on that one side Its known as the land hemisphereand the other side the exact other half of the Earthis called the water hemisphere Now you might be saying to yourselfOkay great So Earth sandwichesare almost always soggy Why should I careI dont know But heres somethingthat you should care about— the Three Gorges Damin China one of the largest hydroelectric damsever constructed Completed in 2006and upon completion it fundamentally changedsomething about Earth You know how a figure skaterspinning in place can slow down their speedby moving their arms out by moving some of their body massaway from the middle of their body Well the same thing can happen to Earth The Three Gorges Damdid exactly what a figure skater does when they move their armsaway from their center It transferred 39 trillion kilograms of water 175 meters above sea level NASA calculated thatthat massive amount of water moved caused Earths rotation to slow down so that every day of your lifesince that dam was finished has been longerby 06 microseconds Its not something thatfor all intents and purposes you have to worry about If you are worriedyou might be hydrophobic but youre in good company—there are a lot of good hydrophobic materials and they behavein some pretty cool ways Hydrophobic materials are resistantto getting wet Thats right—theyre usually madeout of hydrocarbons that dont form good hydrogen bondswith water molecules and because it takes more energyfor the water to spread out on those surfacesthe water just sticks together It coheres to itselfand forms nice little spheres Now in certain casessuperhydrophobia occurs and it looks awesome The leaves of the lotus plant do thisand when water falls on them the water just floats aroundlike some big old blob of liquid mercury or something Its a very bizarre trickand I have you guys to thank for bringing it to my attention In fact it was that messagethat inspired me to do an episode about water in the first placeso thanks One final note on hydrophobia—it can happen in humans And I dont mean being afraid of swimming or not liking the ocean—I mean an actual psychological aversion to the sight of water Rabies is a virus thatif left untreated can leadto severe neurological damage In the late stages of rabiesthe victim salivates constantly but their throat and jawbecome paralyzed which means that the body cannot controlthe fluid in its own mouth and is in a constant fearof drowning This man has contracted rabiesand is in the late stages of the disease As he attempts to take a drink of fluid his body recoils instinctivelyas if the water might burn him But thanks to vaccination effortsthe threat of rabies all over the worldhas been significantly reduced Now we could say a lot of other stuffabout water but I might save thatfor another episode In the meantime And as always thanks for watching,151.95402298850576,casessuperhydrophobia,0.0,1.0,YMTLkDrcr28,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMTLkDrcr28

You Can't Touch Anything,2011-09-03T22:37:29Z,5.483333333333333,7256454,161375,Hey Vsauce Michael here And todaywere going to get close like really close In fact I want to answer the questionwhats the closest we can get to other objects and other people Now it might sound like kind of a simple easy question but when we get down to the atoms of it its quite complex and might leaveyou feeling a little bit alone When I go like this my fingers for allintents and purposes are touching But at an atomic level theyre not Thats right in fact if youre sitting in a chair right now your body is technically not touching the chair at all Instead you are hovering above the chair by some tiny tiny atomically sized gap something too small for us to even see but its there And its caused by the fact that your butt and the chair are made out of atoms Now as we all know the matter that we deal with every day is made out of atoms And an atom is a nucleus surrounded by an outer shell of orbiting electrons Now when two atoms get close to each otherthat arent going to bond or chemically react they have trouble touching each other Why Because electrons repel one another because they have the same charge And because of a fancy thingcalled the Pauli exclusion principle we also know that all of an atoms electrons cannot all be pushed down to the same energy levelall together on the same shell So what this means is that if I touch somethingIm technically not really touching it The atoms are getting quite close together but the electromagnetic repulsion between electrons is saying no no no no closer Now of course the nerves in my skin can feel that repulsive force and thats what I call the texture or the feeling of the object If I push hard enough of course I can break or poke into or cut something but Im not touching any of its matter Im just pushing it out of the way using the electronelectron repulsion forces Even though you can cut things really easily like this the scissors never touched the card This is where it gets depressing What all of this means is that when you kissedyour girlfriend or pet your dog or hug your grandmother youre not actuallymaking contact with their matter Youre not technically touching them youre just feeling the repulsive force of their electrons But maybe theres hope Lets just avoid electrons altogether and ask ourselves what can we do to affect the nucleus ofsomeone elses atoms Maybe we can do that Youre going to have to be a little bitradioactive if youre going to want to do this and luckily people are a little bit radioactive In fact if you sleep in a bed with another personfor an entire year your body is actually exposed to one millirem more radiation than someone who sleeps alone Now we are talking about tiny tiny amounts that really dont affect your body at all but still they are thereHow did they get there Well carbon 14 is in the air and potassium 40 is in bananas thats right Bananas have a really high potassium content In fact any food that has a lot of potassium in it like Brazil nuts is going to act the same way All of that potassium is fine and dandy but about one out of every 8000 or so potassium atoms is a radioactive isotope of potassium In fact if you were to eat 600 bananas it would be the equivalent of getting a chest xray Okay cool so I am a little bit radioactive Does that mean that if I hug someone really close that some sort of radioactive ray might come out of my body and go into someone elses body and get absorbed into a nucleus of one of their atoms and then we could really finally say that we touched on a fundamental level Maybe The radiation that comes out of us is very unlikely to hit someone elses atoms and because people dont containa lot of radioactive material in the bodies that energy is just going to get absorbed and youre not going to really know that it happens and the chance like I said is super unlikely So maybe we should go backa little bit and talk about chemical reactions Back when I mentionedthat atoms have trouble touching they are a little more friendly if theyget together and you know share electrons Now this kind of stuff is happening all the time When I eat food my body is chemically reacting with that food to take out the nutrients get rid of the stuff I dont want butshort of being a cannibal and eating someones arm or being a zombie how can I get chemicallyreactionally close to a person Well luckily there is a thing called birth When youre growing inside your mother your father and mothers DNAare all working together in chemical ways to create you Because theyre sharing electronsit seems at least more like a touch I guess what Im trying to say is that in a wayyour parents and your children are the only people you can know forcertain youve come the closest to actually touching And thats touching And as always thanks for watching,162.49240121580547,chemicallyreactionally,0.0,1.0,yE8rkG9Dw4s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE8rkG9Dw4s

WHY IS THERE A MOON? .... and more!,2011-08-17T21:22:01Z,5.833333333333333,3822557,56874,Hey Vsauce Michael hereAnd Im Regents Park in London joined by Tom from Tom Awesome channel check it outThis camera belongs to Tom and Hazel is operating it right nowYeah thats her giving a thumbs up which Im sure just look like a blurbut the point is were gonna do information today Right now Tom Im in LondonWhich is in England And its also in the United KingdomWhich is in Europe Okay and weve also got another term  Great BritainWell lets unpack all these terms and today learn about geographyI may have failed geography Can I find someone else Now if were going to talk aboutgeography I think we should go all the way back to a time when there was no geography Thats rightWay before YouTube existed our solar system was nothing but amist of dust and gases what is known as a solar nebulaBut then about 46 billion years ago something majestic happenedWe dont know exactly what caused it but some scientists believe that theshockwave of a nearby supernova hit our nebula causing it to start spinning and contracting Now as things collectedtogether their overall gravity got stronger and they pulled more stuff in itAnd boom weve got a SunA half billion years later and the disk of junk circling aroundthe Sun starts coming together in its own way into what we now call the planetsOne of these planets Ive actually visited and its called EarthBut before we get ahead of ourselves what the heck is the Moon doing thereI mean heres the problem When you look at all the terrestrial planetsall the planets near us near the Sun they all have very similar structure andtheyll have the same big metal core and they all have very similar densitiesBut the Moon is very not denseAnd it doesnt have a similar structure it doesnt have a hugedense metal core In fact when we visited them and broughtback dust and rocks to analyze what the Moon was made out of we found that the Moon was made out ofthe same stuff that you find in Earths crust and mantle but not Earths core This discovery gave rise to apretty awesome idea that the moon is actually made out ofwhat used to be on EarthAbout 452 billion years ago there used to beanother planet called Theia It was a little bit smallerthan Mars but it had an unfortunate orbit It was fine for millions of yearsbut eventually and what did happen to it was that itcollided with Earth Now its believed thatthe collision happened quite slowly and the centers the cores of both Theia and Earth fused into one And material from themantle and crust of Earth wasnt just scatteredbut it was forcefully ejected literally launched into outer spaceIt circled around Earth and scientists believe that it tookonly about a week for all that Earth material out in spaceto coalesce into what we now call the MoonOh and by the way if thats how the Moon formedit was such a strong collision the actual axis that the Earth spun on was tilted 235 degrees which to this day is why we have seasonswell Wow Alright so four billion years ago thecontinents as we know them began to emerge You know these pieces ofthe Earths crust that have cooled down and are floating around on Earths moltenliquid insides Now they move and theyve been inconstant motion since they began but they move very very slowlyEvery 300 to 500 million years the continents all converge into whats called one big supercontinentAll the land in the entire Earth altogether and the rest of it covered inocean The most recent supercontinent is kind of a famous its called Pangaea But scientists believe that theremay have been four five six or even more supercontinents that existed before PangaeaWhats really mindblowing is the fact that eventually theresgoing to be another Pangaea another supercontinent And based on calculationsthe Earth at that time will look like this But like I saidthese land masses are moving very very slowly and so for that reason it is worthlearning their names as they are nowWhich brings us back to the question of England United Kingdom Great Britain British Isles and what all these terms meanLets begin zoomed outThe British Isles and Ireland are a collection of 6 thousand islands off the coast of EuropeThe term Great Britain refers to the largestof these islands Now Great Britain contains threeseparate countries England Wales and ScotlandIf we add Northern Ireland into the mix were now looking at what is known asthe United Kingdom or the UK The Republic of Ireland is aseparate country that is not part of the United Kingdom And by the wayEngland is where London is which is where Summer in the City wasWhich brings us back to Regents Park And as always thanks for watching Could you guys stand still for a second To learn more about Great Britain Ireland overseas territories and even Canada you really must check out CGPGreys explanation video if you havent seen it alreadyThis guys incredible You can also check out the channels

What Is Video ??,2011-08-02T20:10:52Z,6.033333333333333,3618881,75963,Hey Vsauce Michael hereand I just got back from VidCon The entire convention wasincredible but the whole time I was there I thought a lot about videoWe all watch video and many of us work with videobut what is it I mean what really is video Well guess what todaywere gonna take a look To begin I think we should start allthe way down at the bottom with languageWhat does the word record mean The story behind the word record isactually quite cool and makes me a little sentimental The word record comes from the Latinwhere re means again and cor means the heart or the soul So when you record something you areliterally bringing it back into your heart bringing it back into yoursoul remembering it Now that sounds really nice and prettybut it actually had more to do with the fact that ancient people thought that the heartwas we were stored memories not the brain The reason a sequence of still imagescan appear to be moving is an effect known as beta movementIf images move fast enough our brain cant comprehend them asseparate images and the illusion of motion is createdNow for a very long time we recorded moving images on photographic filmbut later on a new way of capturing moving imagescame about and it was called videoVideo comes from the Latin for I see and rather than preserving a movingimage chemically on celluloid photographic film stockvideo is an electronic representation of the moving imageNow in the real world stuff just happens The things just continuouslyhappen But in the world of a camera whether its film or video camera its almost always inthe form of frame rates Pictures of the world taken at acertain speed that are then quickly gone through producing through beta movementthe illusion of movement When a camera records at a lower framerate playback often looks jittery and skips like this More framesper second means that more information is taken every second leading to more fluidityBut that leads to a whole can of worms which is a great transition to aconversation I had with Dylan from HouseholdHacker at VidCon Roll the tape Hey Vsauce Michael here and I am in the bathroom at VidCon and Ive got a special guest Right outside its Dylan from HouseholdHackerHey whats going on everyone You know I got a good question for youbased on frame rates and what not What would you say the human eye sees as a frame rate Very good question What frame rate do we see the world in with our eyeballsI mean how fast does information travelfrom our eye to our brain It obviously cant be too lowbecause fast objects dont look like theyre skipping they look pretty fluid Well its a little bit of atrick question because our eyes are not camerasInstead they track onto objects and receive a continuous flow of photonsonto the retina sending information via a chemical reaction to the brain Now heres what we do nowThe visual cortex in our brain usually holds that informationfrom our retina for about a fifteenth of a second So if an animation movesfifteen frames a second or faster its gonna look nice and fluidBut if its lower than fifteen frames a secondour brains not fooled by the beta movement and itll look like its skipping So basicallythe faster the frame rate the better everythings gonna look in the end Heres the thingIf frame rates get higher and higher you wind up with an image that canactually cause headaches when people watch it on the screen Uhm Here Ill explain whyHold this camera for a second Oh yeah no problemSo back to the point about our eyes tracking onto objectsIf I do this  move my hand in front of my face andtrack it with my eyes  I can see my hand it makes sense But ata certain point my hand will move so fast that its just a blur and the reasonits a blur is because my eye can only track so fast And when objects movefaster than our eyeballs can track your brain adds in motion blur That way we get a sense ofmovement happening but we dont see something like a hand randomly appearing all over the placeBut this becomes a problem with new highdefinition programs on big televisions because some of thoseprograms are brought to your TV at frame rates as high as a 1000 frames a second And objects like a tennis ballthat normally travels so fast our eyes cant track them and they look blurrydont look blurry because the camera is able to see themclearly And when you watch that program on TV you can actually get a headache or getdizzy so theyre having to find ways to add blur back into HD picturesPretty neat right Thats great information How did youlearn this Thats what Im here for man Thank you See youSee you You know the bathroom You knowI heard you coming out Did you wash your hands Uhm yeah So there you go Some cool facts aboutvideo that I learned while I was flying to and from VidCon from New York to LAIt was a long flight but I learned a lot and I wanna end with some numbers aboutYouTube specifically YouTube host videos from all over the worldMassive massive amountsIn fact every minute of the day people are uploading video to YouTubeAnd if you were to take all the video uploaded to YouTube at any given minuteall together it would equal 48 hours Thats rightTwo full days of video are uploaded to YouTube every singleminute You guys are part of something gigantic All right now later this weekIll have a new episode of IMG And soon enough well have episodes ofDONG LÜt its gonna be super cool so be sure youre subscribed so you dont miss anything And as always thanks for watching Theyre not

BIGGEST EXPLOSIONS,2011-07-22T21:37:31Z,6.083333333333333,8142033,174600,Hey Vsauce Michael hereand today Im in my apartment But when I was in Kansas with familymy dad lit off what is known as a quarter stick But dont worry absolutely no children were around Okay look the point is that today were going to talk about explosives Lets begin way down the scale with black powder or smokeless powder which many modern rounds use Now usually smokeless powder doesnt even detonate Instead it deflagrates Technically an explosion is only a detonation when the material or the gases expelled travel faster than the speed of sound If the explosion is subsonicyoure only dealing with a deflagration Now we want a bullets propellantto deflagrate not detonate because we want it to have enough powerto move the bullet quickly but not release its energy so fastas to damage the gun or ourselves Take a look at some smokeless powderlit in the open and slow motion It burns very strongly and quickly but at all times the gasses it expelsnever exceed the speed of sound and no shock wave is produced Were looking at deflegration here not detonation To compare this is nitroglycerin Its so fragile you hit it with a hammer and it detonates Even at a slower speed we can see that all the material immediately explodes Consumer fireworks use black powder gun powder and as such they dont have enough power to really ever be set to detonate The same goes for that quarter stickyou saw my dad light off Those and M80s and cherry bombs are louder and often illegal but they burn flash powder not a high explosive light dynamite But that doesnt mean fireworks cant be amazing Currently some of the largestshells in use are 48 inches across When exploded in the air a 48 inch shell looks like this Or like this Oh yeah when they fail to launch and burst on the ground instead it looks like this But lets move on to detonations—no matter what material releases the energy— whether its a conventional explosive or a nuclear bomb or an asteroid impact or an earthquake they are all commonly measured by saying how much TNT you would have to detonate to get an equivalently strong explosion To give you a sense of scalehere is the detonation of approximately 100 tons of TNT by a defense contractor disposing of explosives Unlike deflegrations detonations produce a shockwave which is just that a wave made of areas of high pressure and low pressure This explosion was so powerfulthe area of low pressure had such low pressure that water vapor in the air around it condensed momentarily which formed this cloud And heres a video of an explosion where the shock wave is particularly visible as it approaches and hits the camera man You can also see shock condensationclouds around these explosions set off by the United States in Hawaii in 1965 The US wanted to know nuclear attackswould affect naval ships so they detonated an equivalent amount of TNT on an island with US ships anchored nearby This pile contains 500 tons of TNT waiting to explode When it does it looks like this Earlier the US tested actual nuclear weaponsto see how underwater detonations might affect our ships This underwater nuclear explosion is much larger the equivalent of not 100 tons of TNT not 500 tons but 8000 tons For comparison the atomic bombdropped on Hiroshima in 1945 exploded with the energy of 15000 tons of TNT The single most physically powerful deviceever used by humanity was the Tsar Bomb The Soviet Union tested it in 1961 far up north away from civilization It was detonated two and a half milesabove the surface of the earth to minimize its destruction whichwas unprecedented by man The Tsar Bomb exploded with the power equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT The mushroom cloud from the Tsar Bomb extended beyond our normal atmosphereinto the mesosphere and dwarfed the largest clouds from US detonations It was so large that comparatively the bombs dropped on Japan welltheyre on the graph way down there But at the end of the daynothing can beat supernovas the explosion of an entire star While 50 million tons may sound like a lotone supernova is estimated to give off the energy equivalentof ten octillion million tons of TNT I leave you with a cannon developed bythe US to shoot a normal little cannon ball except that it carried a nuclear warhead Im pretty sure you can pick these up atBass Pro Shop but regardless be sure youre subscribed to Vsauce so you dont miss anything coming up And as always thanks for watching,127.72602739726028,condensationclouds,0.0,-1.0,rdHRX7iIAQs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdHRX7iIAQs

"Nerd Wars WTF 2: Snarf, Ewoks, Dr Doom, Flash, Sonic and more",2010-11-05T19:15:16Z,5.866666666666666,74282,751,hi welcome to wackygamer hey hi hi hi hi i have a beard again yeah weird its like we filmed those videos a month ago so today on wacky game were gonna be talking about uh some of your uh suggestions for nerd wars indeed you guys like the format of the wtf edition uh so were gonna stick with that and were just gonna go through a bunch of them and see what comes out of our mouse yay what kind of dirty ew drink the flash versus sonic the hedgehog flash fastest man alive he actually transcends time yeah uh sonic collects rings i i say sonic what dudes got all that gold i mean hell buy some weaponry to kill the flash yeah um actually no its going to be the flash thank you yeah all right the flash can just rewind time until he goes back before sonic bought the weapons and then caps them sonic is beaten by a wall the flash can vibrate his body so much that he can go through solid matter yeah so were gonna have to go with uh snarf on that one next up snarf versus the ewoks now snarf being the annoying guy from the thundercats versus an ewok being the annoying guys from return of the jedi yeah um uh would anybody watch that how are we defining who wins are we fighting who would win in a fight or who would annoy people the most you know i dont i dont even think that we should we should do it who wins i i want to know about the circumstances of the its a fight to the death and they both have to die i think thats the thing im going to have to give it to the ebox because they have spears ive never seen snarf carry a weapon snarf doesnt carry a weapon so yeah i guess youd have to give it to the e1 cause the ewoks the only one with the pointy thing but but youd hope that somehow theyd screw up enough to impale both of themselves maybe the ewok would be dumb enough to like stick the spear in the ground and then theyd just both jump on it yeah that would be that would be nice the victory nice for both of them snarf ungawa you know well that was a good song next up shredder versus doctor doom really yeah dr doom is kind of an idiot are we are we talking otto von doom or my my physician no were talking about auto bondu okay because my doctor is kind of stupid you have a doctor named doctor doom yeah thats why i went to its spelled with an e at the end isnt it its its doeme its but its german so its still not doom well yeah okay heres the thing i know dr doom and the shredder look a little similar uh the shorts are wearing metal yeah they got the metal players now again for those who dont know shredder from teenage mutant ninja turtles yeah von doom from comic books right okay uh shredder couldnt beat some pubescent teenage turtles and how is he going to be in there doom he gets so upset about this i i would actually make an argument for shredder how are you gonna do it bebop and rocksteady are gonna come along and just distract von doom our doctor doom so much doctor dooms gonna get pissed off and kill himself okay all right i guess uh suicide based on you know annoying how how badly the the tv series ruined the comic book the tv series was awesome the comic book was great it is true even though it was black and white it was really it was really good but it was black and white who cares i couldnt get past that initially its like i need color i cant imagine anything if its just shades of grey lets move on okay the last one rorschach watchman rorschach hes the guy with the white mask and the black patterns that move all over it versus the punisher this is a comic really good fight this is actually a really good one maybe well do a full one maybe not but maybe well do i could talk about this forever uh i who who do you think jeff who do you think see i know more rorschach than punisher so i would have to side with war shock only because i go with what i know yeah um but rorschach i think is in my mind a little crazier a little more unstable and more likely to pull something out of his ass that that punisher punisher just seems to work on rage where rorschach is a little bit of like well yeah the thing is you know rorschach just uses whats in his environment whereas the punisher uses the weapons he brings to a fight and the environment so i think really the thing is like where are they fighting yeah and you know if i were to jungle if they were fighting in the woods id give it to the punisher yeah i probably would too if they were fighting in this building or an office building yeah id probably give it to rorschach uh that being said id want to see rorschach win that being said i would just like to see somebody film that fight i would i would love if somebody can make that happen out there you know that would be one of those epic like cinematic moments why dont they have just a rorschach comic book lets go write it we should yeah lets get out of here lets go check us out back again weve got stuff against the comment videos in the comments thumbs up oh my god rorschach its gonna be awesome get it man were gonna give is it copy written i dont think it is all right

MARIO'S MISTAKES?  -- Chat with Black Nerd Comedy --,2010-09-22T22:02:34Z,7.916666666666667,505711,3098,hey Vsauce how are you doing happy Wednesday we have a special treat for you today because Mario turned 25 years old last week and I have a confession to make because of my troubled childhood I didnt get to learn enough about Mario but Ive got a special guest here Andre aka black nerd comedy anyway let me give him a call uhoh what oh sorry I was not looking at pictures of Kim Kardashians butt where we go oh I used to have a dream Compassions bottom is my desktop on my laptop that I would bring in to work I dont even know why I thought that was a good idea as we all know Mario turned 25 years old last week so a milestone its a quarter of a century of Mario and you are one of the preeminent Mario fans you are a Mario historian a Mario lore expert but yet on this occasion of the 25th birthday youve got some constructive criticisms for him some lessons learned just a little bit its a little bit this my Turkish ISM as he gets older its time for him to say all right that I did make some mistakes and I want to take make sure that this doesnt happen for the next 25 years thats why Im here for for that first off the bat this is one of the first times that weve had a Mario game with no Luigi and people freaked out they were like where wheres Luigi at people were making fake Luigi video screens on the computer it was like people wanted Luigi so bad we just werent used to not having the Super Mario Brothers to Fedder Luigis a plumber he may have been like Mario I hear you got a new game will be there sometime between 8 am and 3 pm and I just never showed in addition to not having Luigi this is also the first game where Princess Toadstool is referred to as Princess Peach now apparently shes been Princess Peach for a long time in Japan but we have just known her as Princess Toadstool and theres all of a sudden her name is peach it was never explained that she officially get a name change is she Princess Peach toadstool is like her full name um you know its just I understand later why they had to do it for games to make them short but its like I like Princess Toadstool it sounds like a royalty I am Princess Toadstool but I come in Prince peach I I dont expect you to uh rule country I expect you to dance on a stripper pole yeah said it versus Pete sounds like a stripper name Wow that is so funny because I was gonna say that I love Princess Peach so much better like toadstool I think of fungus and I think of like poisonous mushrooms and I think of like little toad guys and stool which means poop so come on how could you possibly want a toadstool I eat peaches I dont rescue them well wait a minute but probably the weirdest thing is Yoshi uh who we got to ride so many times in Super Mario World and then Ill be that dirty way uh he shows up in the game after youve beaten the entire game you have to get all 120 stars get everything in the game before you can find him on top of a castle and he talks to you you dont ride him he gives you a hundred lives and then he jumps off of the castle hes at the top of the castle gives you a hundred lives and its like well you have a clicker but I dont need my one and just commit suicide how is how is this fun for kids you just showed you she committed suicide two different games two completely different elements but both have the same problem with me which kind of can be commonly referred to for me as crap on the back uh both games feature the main character with something on their back that for most of the game you cant get rid of in Super Mario Sunshine hes wearing this water pack and hes like shooting water all over the place or using water to pump up higher and its cute for a while but its on almost every single level its only small little bonus levels where you dont get to wear it which are the best parts of the game I want just a game of that I dont need all of the water levels and then Luigis Mansion is the same thing he just goes in the haunted house and hes just sucking everything up with a vacuum that you cannot get off your back so you cant jump or anything Wows Andre it sounds like that would suck see what I did there hahaha thats why they pay me the big bucks and buy big bucks I mean they just laugh at me I actually bought this game for my sister because shes got a we down in Dallas and um they get us back to the platform feel the scrolling platform which is what made me feel scared as a kid about Mario 64 but they get back to the platform and you can actually play two player it works out better but I wouldnt know like are you freaking kidding me or players at one time youre welcome sister I Love New Super Mario Bros Wii its like it goes back to the classic Mario platformers that we all know and love and its clear that this is a popular title like it still it came out last year and its still selling it sold more copies than Super Mario Galaxy 2 which just came out which got more accolades it just shows that people love that classic 2d formula so very few things to complain about I think the only real problem that I have um is that theres four players Mario Luigi and in two tones its like we have the entire Nintendo library and you give me a yellow toad and a blue toad and this causes a lot of problems lately and that screen gets pulled far back because youre like which tone mi I dont know who I am it gets really confusing this is a point where I would have accepted waluigi i would like alright we can have Mario Luigi Wario and Waluigi Ill accept it just dont give me a toad come on the music is great the the flying with different planets is great the different types of levels and what you can do in each of the levels it is almost perfection theres only two words that I can say that makes me annoyed at Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 purple coins any stage you have to do youve got to collect purple coins to get your star you will leave that game in frustration you a lot a Wii Remote places where we remote should not be you will be so incredibly angry because they are just mean literally literally the stage will be like this you have to collect a hundred purple coins in less than two minutes on platforms that disappear and reappear as you flip in the air and if you get hit one time youre dead go what do you have a problem with me Miyamoto get did I anger you too that push you in a puddle or something as a kid and dont remember it like you are like apparently just mad at Americans when you made these levels because they are just evil evil purple stage level they hate you but later on they got rid of the purple coin mechanic like they never did it again so he learned from his mistakes so he did it again he did it worse are you Andre this is turning into a terrible birthday party for Mario okay so what is it I know what youre thinking Super Mario Bros 3 best game of all time what could possibly wrong with it well there is something wrong with it and if youre a younger gamer you probably wouldnt know about it because youve been privileged to get the this particular feature but if you had the game originally you did not have this certain feature but Im talking about oh my video alright so if you guys want to see that and the rest of this video its totally awesome in fact youre entitled your

BioShock Infinite Trailer HD [WITH REACTION],2010-08-17T15:48:58Z,5.6,83699,536,hey everybody Jeff from Waikiki gamer the new BioShock Infinite trailer came out commentaries afterwards Music play Music whats BioShock Infinite its this game thats set in the Bioshock unit no its not yes it is all right Im really really excited about this game I guarantee you of rationals gonna knock it out of the park but the trailer has me wondering what the hecks going on its in a space well its a guy this guy its a sky city if I wanted that Id go play Star Wars and play investment how can you even call it Bioshock Bioshock is very specific about the plasmon world underwater big daddys little sisters you think what do you think when you think Bioshock well I do think underwater but its just one city in the whole world why does every city have to be underwater in Bioshock you cant just put a sky city and call it Bioshock the I you know what I liked Bioshock up until I got to the Big Daddies and then I hated it so you hated the whole game yeah basically youre an idiot Bioshock was one of the best games ever second was good I dont think it was good as person one story wasnt as good Ive only played the first one and I used all my ammo on that big daddy and he just killed me over and over to shows I dont know if youve seen our Marvel vs Capcom video where I kicked his ass just shows how bad he is a game I mean I thank you so much Jeff just meet you more a day the worst part about this trailer beyond the name and the fact that theyre calling a Bioshock is theres not a lick a gameplay well and theres barely a story theres a guy falling who got fallen and a woman catches him if you could call for script catching I thought the force grip is neat I dont know why she needed roses yeah woman absorb all the roses shes kind of like oh I just kind of need to see what Im gripping help me make a bouquet Im a Jedi but I dont show me some gameplay then maybe I wouldnt be ragging on the name of the game because thats really all youve given me is a with rose petals now shitty name no I disagree uh what they gave us was a concept and I think its a really neat interesting name the concept something thats related to the visual concept youre showing me but how heres the thing how much how many times are they going to be able to do the same game underwater over and over again Im not a bank in the loop but come up with a new name for it sky city would be better than Bioshock I have no problem with the new Bioshock game actually I think it looks good in it and despite the fact that I hate the other Bioshock games I might play it and Im going to say I might play it despite the fact trailer sucks has no gameplay in it and the title meaningless it is kind of me you might as well call it it NFL football 2011 Sky City well no that would have made more sense because it had Sky City in it I just think infinite what does that have to do with anything I know hopefully its gonna be something I did not see an infinite world that guy was clearly falling to the ground there hadnt the arms on it he was gonna eat on porn right before he well and the thing is even the concept of infinity the human mind cant even fathom it so why even bother is actually not Adams mind which is no any mind you draw in the same small town what do you work whyd you bring up gerbils what have you what if people told you,120.89285714285715,commentaries,1.0,0.4,jdA1VRmgcWY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdA1VRmgcWY
Video Game Clichés IN REAL LIFE -- Episode 1,2010-08-15T20:47:08Z,3.95,102060,1306,hey everyone its lacy and this is BTW on Vsauce whats on the plate for this week how about some video game cliches whether its save points Health meters three lives or certain things that have shown up through generation after generation of video game what if if we could take those cliches and put them into real life the first one is all about health if I had the chance to capture this concept I would not only save the medical world but I think I would help out a lot of different people like those people on jackass happy about Music it you can either eat something like a mushroom or you take a potion my example comes from Castlevania where you eat a piece of chicken to get full Music health oh Music    Music or you could just eat a bunch of Double Downs that might always help the next cliche is a concept thats used in tons of games I could use so many examples but Im going to use the example from N64 Golden Eye in which you have tons of items on you at all times and yet you look perfectly normal no one would ever think that James Bond is carrying a grenade launcher or a rocket launcher or a machine gun because he looks perfectly normal in his tuxedo Music right Im Music sorry have you ever noticed in a lot of different games especially in RPGs that you have those menus that pop up that have different phrases that decide Your Destiny or where youre going in the game did you ever think that those might help you in real life I mean a good example would be on a date perhaps tits or GTFO or romantic walk on the beach what if that just came into your daily schedule you have turned the key of Destiny only you have the power to control it the power to choose a path I want to start the car path to Greatness I want to go you have the strength to wield this power I want to    go remember that the power I want to go and only you can hold on the destiny aits remember to Choose Wisely lets face it our world revolves around money so in games its a common thing that you can get money for beating stuff up so I thought what if you could kill someone in real life without consequences and get money with that that be okay well thats all I have for you this week I hope you enjoyed what you saw if I forgot a video game cliche that youd really like to see go ahead and put in the comment section below until next time Im Lacy and uh BTW there arent any extra lives Music IRL,120.75949367088607,consequences,0.0,1.0,7wupvHtEbEU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wupvHtEbEU
NERD WARS: Thor vs. Kratos -- Who Would Win?,2010-08-13T20:32:01Z,7.35,132843,1406,hey everybody its the wacky Gamers okay Adams lame but its us its Jeff and Adam Im Adam and were here to do another versus video yes we are a lot of people seem to like them so were going to keep going but this time its another user suggestion keep posting user suggestion yes lets what well lets say some of the user suggestions that they sent us Jeff okay so one of the ones they gave us was Harry Potter versus Percy Jackson its kind of interesting that was badani yep we decided it would end up in a make out session between the two because the two of them would just get for each other uh the next one Mr Freeze versus Subzero that was from geekam that was pretty good idea but we decided that uh theyre just too icy cold for us but it was a cool idea thank you for posting it and the last one we wanted to call out that we wont do but we thought was cool is megaan versus Punisher that was interesting we argued about it for a while and then ended up in a    fight Mega Man would win Mega Man would win um the the one were going to do today also from X Nemesis katos versus Thor but before that want to talk about what happened the last time so we did we did Bowser versus the Hulk Bowser versus the Hulk you want to tell him what we found out about the Hulk Jeffs uh argument for why Bowser would win was basically centered around the fact that the Incredible Hulk can get hurt by fire well unfortunately Stan Lee listened to our podcast not really someone who knows Stan Lee listened and asked Stan and and Stan said the Hulk is immune to Fireballs immune to Fireballs which I said okay so were going to give that one to the Hulk quns regardless of the comments were just going to have to throw that one out Iron Man versus Master Chief was much more debated the user spoke and it seems that Master Chief has the edge especially if you consider Tony Stark and master chief outside of their their um I wouldnt say costumes but their armor their armor yeah anyway now onto the task at hand all right Thor versus katos Thor versus katos you want to take video games again and Im going to take comic book cuz this time theyre going to win heartily again like Master Chief Style lets lets hear it go ahead Throw Down The Gauntlet no I want to hear your bull crap you want to he you want to hear my bull crap go ahead all right well uh Thor as we all know God of Thunder you mean Fabio and a Viking helmet see youre going to interrupt me when Im talking first off Fabio is a strong man did you see him hit like if if Thor can take a goose to the face the same way Fabio did no question about it Thor wins if Fabio took a dick to the face like Thor does no doubt kattos is going to kick his ass Thor has never taken a dick to the face Thor is so powerful he once reconstructed the moon can you say that about kattos that wouldnt help you in a fight sure you you make a moon and then you throw it at somebody but you got to make the moon meanwhile katos just sliced your head off Thor has the the Hammer of the Gods of exil Blades of Exile boo whatever the Hammer of the god hes got one hammer of a god which its a freaking Hammer I mean seriously could you come up with a Lamer weapon no sharp edges its just War object a blunt object actually the back of the hammer has a blade on it not in any picture I ever saw Im going to some UL picture picture picture picture picture of well youre showing old picture old picture old picture oh so were not were not counting the back picture tros never had a lame weapon now its single lame weapon he took the weapons from every God in the Greek pantheon every God every God hes got the power of Hermes which is kind of gay um I will say but hes got hes the God of War okay so so his sole purpose in life is to kick some ass so your argument is that he has uh the power of Hermes no all meaning that he can run fast hes got the blade of AA heres the thing heres the thing with the with running fast actually Thor is so fast he was able to build trenches before Quicksilver the fastest Marvel character could get there it doesnt matter bam hes fashion than Quicksilver and Ill tell you this what speed going to do for you when Kratos just whooped your ass calls the spirits of the dead and just kicked your ass heres a little not fact uh Thor is like the most powerful Marvel character there is hes the    closest thing to have superos is the most badass video game character of all time well no doubt he is he killed every Greek God and he been killed multiple times and crawled his ass back out of Hades and just whooped some more ass oh if we were going to talk about being killed every single Marv character has been killed multiple times needs to eat golden app to be immortal just stays or Immortal forever well you know what golden apples how how       is that you know what oh you know what halfway through I win no you dont heres why you dont win because halfway through the fight with Thor Kratos would have to stop and solve a stupid boring puzzle that he cant figure out because the camera angle never changes Thor wins yeah you think the Thor games going to be any better H the Thor game is going to be Flawless the Thor game is based on a freaking movie which is going to be terrible because thats how most comic book movies end up I dont know if you saw the Daredevil movie wait a minute but no wait a minute there a lot of good comic book movies you know what would be a terrible movie krto God of War the movie no it wouldnt yes it would no it wouldnt it it would be as good as the Resident Evil movie exactly thats what I said katto would just get out his sole purpose in life he doesnt care about other people he could care less if he destroys the planet and destroying Thor but Thor would be oh someones going to get hurt one of my poor Nordic    is going to get hurt katos no go ahead and kill the    no heres heres the thing Kratos has no friends and no allies whereas Thor has the entire Pantheon he doesnt cuz he kills them all and steals their powers if Thor had any coones he would have killed all the ERS and taking their powers look Ive played God of War I the powers arent really that useful the weapons are the most useful thing the powers kind of suck the weapons are what he took from all the other gods cuz you clearly didnt play the game I played the game you from Hermes you get running yeah and from uh what you get from AA a bow and arrow okay he also    Aphrodite Im just saying he did    Aphrodite that wasck yeah all right so were agreeing it was Kratos okay Kratos gets more action but I think Thor would win I I totally disagree yeah me too Kratos killed all the    guys yeah I win of course of course the first timeone suceeded in these arguments and well you know I had to put up a fight but seriously hes killed every God you know okay we well have another one dont forget to post uh I know this ending is kind of lame but dont forget to post the ones you want down below we will get to them we will argue them stupidly just like we do these one and uh we will call out your good ones if you post them and we decide not to argue the give me give me give me I still think Thor would win actually or why do you think Thors going to win Adam likes Fabio cuz hes kind of gay you just have sympathy for bald Laughter people,200.81632653061226,unfortunately,8.0,-1.0,0xJx-0YF5vs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xJx-0YF5vs
Comic-Con WRAP UP: From The Wackygamer Podcast!,2010-08-11T21:44:09Z,7.683333333333334,32344,460,were here to talk about comiccon what to comiccon me a lot fun we wanted to tell you what our favorites and this favorites this did spray I think this favorites is a word were gonna stick with it alright I think my number one favorite what was it women in costumes costumes were pretty near to God pretty hot my god I dont know why attractive women are swarming towards nerds but please keep doing it my favorite would have to be female Boba Fett that was pretty hot iive never thought that that Boba Fett could inspire an erection female Kratos was hot oh Jesus Christ that was that was bad in costume why am i attract what is it about women dressing as male characters that somehow makes it even hotter I dont know but here I saw Lady Deadpool wasnt showing an inch of skin still Oh hot so hot shown the face at all not even wearing the mask wow I dont know why Desperate Dan Lee was in the house Stan Lee was in the house and youve gotta love Stan Lee Im gonna Im gonna preamp this by saying I love Stan Lee no matter what Stan Lees pretty austere King that being said Stan Lee has gone senile and people are willing I dont be hes gone scene hes a little scene out and people are still clapping no matter what he says so Im gonna data true Im at a panel and Im watching and theyre like Stan Lee whos your favorite superhero whos your favorite superhero you made when I was growing up soda cost a nickel and now I have a chair in my shadow country and in everybody claps yes Ted show the clip you show Waki gamer calm well have the full talk that I recorded cuz I was on the other side of the room but there was a point where theyre talking about the game cuz its the Marvel games talk and Stanley just chimes in I just want to say something and its not even relevant to the tough but these guys are all really smart these guys are the smartest people excelsior and I want it just again I love Stan we do love Stanley please youre watching this we love you he got a anything new people clap people clapping we dont have that wouldnt if we dont have that I cant go on say to be like I like pudding and then ever yeah Adams alive hes fat oh okay next topic the proliferation of cheap    and we all know how much Adam looks cheap seen so much cheap stuff yes my first day there I found a 75 off of trade back table and I spent my paper bags trade paperback table I spent a hundred and fifty down and then he comes back to the hotel hes like dude you didnt tell me to leave my wallet I I bought so many comic books its its really sad and now Im reading them on the bus and everybodys looking at me like Im mentally deficient its awesome it is awesome it is awesome everyones now seeing what I already knew reading ultimate xmen investing  they give away a lot of free stuff lots of rights DC was giving away copies everything I got this one because I thought it was funny video game nerds driver and the best part is if you go into the driver comic Im like I got it cuz Im like ridiculous theyre making a comic about driving so lets lets look at the story this is on page one you got page page two and three theres two and three are good and page four and five and then up the comics over just have character it was as bad as I was expecting you know Ill say this when I was playing the game driver I was like I need to know more about this story of this muffler yeah Im like all Im seeing is the back of a car but whats happening inside the car how many transmissions has he burned out on the way to this car a lot a lot I thought it was cool I got to see a bunch of artists while I was there I went and did the sketchbook thing Im a sketch book right here show you a little stuff Im not gonna be able to talk much with it but you can see here whos that Adam whos that okay that would be Green Lantern it is Green Lantern hey Libra Meho did a really good Joker I actually have a video of this hopefully Ill post it on my kitchen or comedy but I corded him doing this actually doing this sketch and my favorite was one of the guys at Pixar see that right here its a his character this beaver would you call it yeah its a beaver its a beaver talking to our 2d  whos projecting the beaver can eat thats it for    so oh thats pretty cool lets film Captain America though Oh Captain America is pretty badass pretty good thats pretty    badass so we gotta find everything there you go heres Captain America all these for free just went around to the artists table talk to them theyre more than willing to do this for me and this is Dave Wilkins it does many in Captain America so lesson being next year at comiccon bring a book full of blank pages for these people to draw in they are desperate for attention they are they just want to meet the fans they really the writers tend to get a lot of the intention the artist artists artists are just happy to have people over they do do full commission a lot of them charge to be like fullpage colors but if theyre not busy theyre more than happy to do a sketch well I had a couple guys just draw pictures of me I was standing there like you want me to draw a picture yeah drop one of me they look at me like Im in the pencil broke anyway they do were moving on moving on next thing I want to talk about this is a dislike or a diss favorite as we established at the beginning Japanese companies giving talks because there were a ton of PACOM Namco whatever pick a especially game company and the Japanese guy would be always a good it was it all used to get money for like 20 freakin minutes and then the translator would be like we are very proud to show you a dead cool rising 1876 alpha yeah Oh syndicates are gonna be sick and I so get it together there will be multiplayer I think its a good thing that and all the shits on the slide right behind them I dont need to say anything you know its I guess in a way its cool to have the creator of Megaman there yeah until what you have to listen to just hired somebody to tell me the things that he wont have him come out and say hi Im the creator of Megaman very happy to be here this guys gonna talk guys gonna talk for me Im just saying if I was in Japan I wouldnt talk and the last thing this was my thing the protest the Westboro Baptist Church were theyre trying to claim that God hates all the comiccon attendees because apparently were all gay yeah I dont understand why might be but the rest of the people probably werent in vast majority Im sure they were gay people there I guarantee theyre really people there just like they were straight people there but the best part was the Comic Con attendees changed a counterprotest and theyre maybe like less than 10 would you agree baptist people yeah it was a small group there must have been over a hundred Comic Con attendees and the best were the ones that had signs that like Superman died for our Superman died person that was a classic sign that was a classic and I may be gay but I do love Commander data just it didnt even make sense but its like alright dude whatever thats it for us about Comic Con check out our other
